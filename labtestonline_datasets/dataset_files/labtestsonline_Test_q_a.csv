https://labtestsonline.org/tests/serum-free-light-chains,Serum Free Light Chains,"['Free Light Chains', 'SFLC', 'FLC', 'Kappa and Lambda Free Light Chains', 'Quantitative Serum Free Light Chains with Ratio']","['Light Chains, Free', 'Free Kappa/Lambda Ratio']","June 4, 2017.","January 21, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Light chains are proteins produced by immune cells called plasma cells. Also called kappa and lambda light chains, they link together with other proteins (heavy chains) to form immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) that target and neutralize specific threats to the body such as bacteria and viruses. Plasma cells normally produce some excess light chains that do not combine with heavy chains and instead enter the bloodstream. Free light chains (FLC) or serum free light chains (SFLC) refer to those that are not part of whole (intact) immunoglobulins and are present in the blood. This test measures the amount of free kappa and lambda light chains in the blood and calculates a kappa/lambda ratio to help detect, diagnose, and monitor conditions associated with an increased production of free light chains.
Each type of immunoglobulin is composed of four protein chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. A particular plasma cell will produce only one type of immunoglobulin. Normally, there is a slight excess of free light chains produced, so low levels of free kappa and lambda chains are detected in the blood.
With a group of conditions called plasma cell disorders (dyscrasias) or monoclonal gammopathies, a plasma cell becomes neoplastic, dividing more than it should and producing a large number of copies (clones) of itself that crowd out other cells in the bone marrow. Since the clones come from a single plasma cell, they may produce large amounts of the same type of abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein). This may be an intact immunoglobulin, only a light chain, or rarely only a heavy chain.
Excess light chain production may be seen with any of the plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, a condition that may progress to multiple myeloma), monoclonal light chain (primary) amyloidosis, and others. These conditions may go unnoticed or may progress to produce various signs and symptoms characteristic of the different diseases."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",Test Preparation Needed?,"None. Typically a trough level is monitored. A trough level is the lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered. For example, if cyclosporine is given twice a day, a blood sample is usually drawn 12 hours after the last dose, before a new dose is given. On mornings when you are scheduled to have your cyclosporine level checked, do not take the medicine until after your blood is drawn."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",What is being tested?,"Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant drug used to reduce the body's natural defenses. This test measures the amount of cyclosporine in the blood.
When people undergo an organ transplant, their immune system recognizes the graft as ""foreign"" and will begin to attack it just as it would any invasive bacteria or virus. Cyclosporine diminishes the ability of certain white blood cells in the immune system to respond to this foreign tissue. The transplanted organ then has a better chance of survival and will not be as easily rejected by the transplant recipient's immune system. Cyclosporine is used routinely in the transplantation of kidney, heart, liver, and other organs.
The immunosuppressant qualities of cyclosporine have also been found to be useful in treating symptoms of some autoimmune and other disorders. These conditions are characterized by the immune system reacting to the body's own cells or tissue. Cyclosporine helps to control the immune response in these cases, decreasing the severity of symptoms. Some examples of these conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, aplastic anemia, and Crohn disease.
When the symptoms in these cases are judged to be severe, extensive, and disabling, cyclosporine may be prescribed. Usually, the symptoms have not diminished with other treatments or medications. Cyclosporine is used with caution in these cases and needs to be carefully monitored with blood tests.
Testing cyclosporine levels in the blood can help ensure that drug levels are in a range that will be therapeutic. If the level is too low, organ rejection may occur (in the case of transplantation) or symptoms may reappear (autoimmune cases). It is also important to ensure that the level is not too high and will not result in toxicity."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",How is it used?,"Tests for cyclosporine are used to measure the amount of this drug in the blood to determine whether cyclosporine concentrations have reached therapeutic levels and are not in a toxic range. Cyclosporine is a drug that diminishes the body's immune response. It is prescribed for organ transplant recipients to prevent organ rejection and for some people with autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, to alleviate symptoms."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",When is it ordered?,"Cyclosporine testing is ordered frequently at the start of therapy, often on a daily basis when trying to establish a dosing regimen. Once an appropriate dose has been determined, the level can be tested less frequently and may eventually be tested monthly, once every two months, or at longer intervals. However, testing may be done more often when a person becomes ill or begins taking additional medications that may affect the metabolism of cyclosporine. A change in a person's metabolic status may also prompt more frequent testing."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",What does the test result mean?,"The therapeutic range for cyclosporine depends on the method used to measure the drug, the type of transplant, and the length of time since the transplant. Results obtained from different types of samples and different methods are not interchangeable. Healthcare practitioners will be guided by the laboratory as to the appropriate therapeutic range to apply to a specific person's test result."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",Is there anything else I should know?,A majority of laboratories use whole blood samples for cyclosporine testing instead of serum or plasma and will collect samples 12 hours after the last dose or just before the next dose (trough levels).
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",How long will I need to be on cyclosporine?,"If you are a transplant recipient, you generally will stay on cyclosporine as long as that is the treatment of choice for you. If there are signs of rejection, even with blood levels in the therapeutic range, you may be switched to a different immunosuppressant drug. Also, there is a greater chance of toxic side effects the longer you are on cyclosporine, so a healthcare practitioner may choose to alter drug therapy when you have been on cyclosporine for more than 2-3 years."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cyclosporine,Cyclosporine,[],[],"February 14, 2018.","February 20, 2020.",Who orders cyclosporine tests?,"Cyclosporine will usually be monitored by healthcare practitioners who have specific knowledge of the condition or disease for which the drug is prescribed. They tend to be very familiar with cyclosporine and its use in therapy, and they understand the importance of monitoring the drug. They may include your surgeon or doctor treating you for your arthritis or psoriasis."

HDL-C consists primarily of protein with a small amount of cholesterol. It is considered to be beneficial because it removes excess cholesterol from tissues and carries it to the liver for removal. HDL cholesterol is often called ""good"" cholesterol. The test for HDL cholesterol measures the amount of HDL-C in blood.
High levels of cholesterol have been shown to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease. When cholesterol levels in the blood increase and not enough is removed by HDL, it may be deposited in the walls of blood vessels. These deposits, called plaques, can build up, causing vessel walls to become more rigid, and may eventually narrow the openings of blood vessels, constricting the flow of blood.
A higher level of blood HDL-C is usually associated with a lower risk of developing plaques, lowering the risk of heart attack or stroke."

For example, if you have a total cholesterol result of 200 mg/dL and an HDL cholesterol level of 50 mg/dL, the ratio would be stated as 4 (or 4:1). A desirable ratio is below 5 (5:1); the optimum ratio is 3.5 (3.5:1).

While some drugs used to lower LDL-C can also raise HDL-C, these drugs are not typically prescribed based on HDL-C levels. Certain lifestyle changes, however, may be recommended to help increase your HDL-C level. Since smoking can decrease HDL-C levels, quitting smoking (if you are a smoker) is a good way to increase HDL-C. Exercise is another good way to increase HDL-C."

However, some recent studies have shown that in some people with high HDL-C, the HDL-C is not protective and may, in fact, result in higher risk for CAD than in people with normal HDL-C levels. In one study, it was shown that people with CAD and high HDL-C had underlying genetic anomalies in enzymes important in lipid turnover (cholesterol ester transfer protein and hepatic triglyceride lipase). Another study showed that high levels of abnormally large HDL-C particles were associated with an increased risk of CAD. Further research is needed to determine what conditions contribute to an unexpectedly high risk of CAD in the presence of high HDL-C."

Traditionally, trained laboratorians have examined blood smears manually using a microscope. More recently, automated digital systems have become available to help analyze blood smears more efficiently.
A blood smear is a snapshot of the cells that are present in the blood at the time the sample is obtained. The blood smear allows for the evaluation of these cells: White blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes) — help fight infections or participate in immune responses
Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes) — carry oxygen to tissues
Platelets (thrombocytes) — small cell fragments that are vital to proper blood clotting These cell populations are produced and mainly mature in the bone marrow and are eventually released into the bloodstream as needed. The number and type of each cell present in the blood is dynamic but is generally maintained by the body within specific ranges.
The drop of blood on the slide used for a blood smear contains millions of RBCs, thousands of WBCs, and hundreds of thousands of platelets. A blood smear examination: Compares the WBCs' size, shape, and general appearance to the established appearance of ""normal"" cells. It also determines the five different types of WBCs and their relative percentages (manual WBC differential).
Evaluates the size, shape, and color (indicators of hemoglobin content) of the RBCs (RBC morphology)
Estimates the number of platelets present A variety of diseases and conditions can affect the number and appearance of blood cells. Examination of the blood smear can be used to support findings from other tests and examinations. For example, RBCs that appear smaller and paler than normal may support other results that indicate a type of anemia. Similarly, the presence of WBCs that are not fully mature may add to information from other tests to help make a diagnosis of infection, malignancy, or other conditions."

There can be some variation in each cell type and numbers the body produces. Use of an automated instrument can often identify the presence of abnormal cells but lacks the ability to definitively subclassify them.

The virus is found in respiratory droplets during an infection and is easily transmitted to others through close physical contact. Parvovirus can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and transmitted through exposure to blood and blood products.
In the United States, as many as 50% of adults and 85% of the elderly have been infected with parvovirus B19, usually as children or young adults. The infection typically has an incubation period of several days to 2-3 weeks, is active for a short period, and then begins to resolve.
For most people, parvovirus B19 infection is indistinguishable from other mild illnesses that develop and go away within a short time period. Many who are infected have no symptoms or have mild flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, a slight fever, headache, or an upset stomach, and many may not know that they have had a parvovirus B19 infection. The majority of people do not experience any significant symptoms or health problems and once the initial infection resolves, the person becomes immune and will not get the infection again.
Some children with the infection develop a characteristic and distinctive bright red ""slapped-cheek"" rash on both cheeks and a raised lacy rash on the torso and extremities. The rashes may come and go for several weeks, reappearing and/or intensifying with exposure to heat and sunlight and with stress. By the time the rash appears, the child is no longer considered infectious. Parvovirus is sometimes called fifth disease because it is the fifth of six common childhood illnesses that can cause rashes.
Less commonly, some adults become infected and may develop ""gloves and socks syndrome"" with painful swelling of joints and reddening of the hands and feet that typically ends abruptly at the wrists and ankles. This condition usually resolves within a few weeks. Symptoms of arthritis may also occur in adults and children, but like ""gloves and socks syndrome,"" tends to resolve a few weeks after infection. Some severe cases, however, have been tied to chronic arthritis and even to the development of rheumatoid arthritis.
Parvovirus B19 can cause major health problems in three types of patients: People with iron deficiency anemia or a condition that affects or shortens the life of red blood cells (RBCs), such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, may develop severe acute anemia during a parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 targets cells in the bone marrow that become RBCs and disrupts the production of new RBCs, which can more severely affect those with underlying blood disorders.
Women who are infected during pregnancy can pass the infection to their babies. Most fetuses will be fine, but a small percentage will develop severe anemia and a few may have an inflammation and infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis). These conditions can cause miscarriage, congestive heart failure in the fetus, hydrops fetalis (associated with fluid accumulation), and sometimes stillbirth. The greatest risk for fetal complications is during the second trimester of pregnancy.
In those with compromised immune systems, a parvovirus B19 infection may cause chronic anemia and be challenging to resolve. This includes people with HIV/AIDS, those who have had organ or bone marrow transplants, and those undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer. Parvovirus B19 testing is not typically used to screen the general population and is not deemed necessary in most cases of infection because symptoms are mild and time-limited. It is usually ordered to determine whether someone is currently, or has recently been, infected with parvovirus only if they are at risk of complications. It may also sometimes be ordered to determine whether someone has ever been exposed to parvovirus. Testing involves either a measurement of parvovirus antibodies—immune proteins produced in response to parvovirus B19 exposure—or the detection of the genetic material of the virus itself (its DNA) during an active infection."

The plasma free metanephrines test measures the amount of metanephrine and normetanephrine in the blood.
Catecholamines are produced by the adrenal glands (as hormones), small triangular organs located on top of each kidney, and by cells of the sympathetic nervous system (called neurotransmitter substances or neurotransmitters). The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are released in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate small air passages in the lungs called bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, which increases blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism).
After completing their actions, catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Epinephrine breaks down into metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and norepinephrine becomes normetanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Catecholamines and their breakdown products are normally found in small fluctuating quantities in the blood and urine and only increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation.
However, rare tumors of the adrenal glands called pheochromocytomas and rare tumors that occur outside the adrenal glands called paragangliomas can produce large amounts of the hormones, resulting in significantly increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. (These syndromes are often grouped together and abbreviated as PPGL.) This can cause persistent or episodic periods of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and the symptoms may worsen. Over time, hypertension caused by the excess hormones may cause kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
Although they are rare, it is important to diagnose these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of catecholamine being produced and to eliminate their associated symptoms and complications."

This test detects these antibodies in the blood to help diagnose pernicious anemia.
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition that can occur when the body's immune system targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against the parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor. Parietal cells are specialized cells in the stomach that make acid to help in food digestion and also make intrinsic factor.
Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of vitamin B12 from food. During digestion, stomach acids produced by parietal cells release vitamin B12 from food, which binds to intrinsic factor to form a complex. The formation of this complex allows vitamin B12 to be absorbed in the small intestine. Among having functional roles in the brain and nervous system, vitamin B12 is important in the production of red blood cells (RBCs).
When the body’s immune system mistakenly targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor, it can cause inflammation and progressively damage the parietal cells. This autoimmune condition, called autoimmune atrophic gastritis, can disrupt the production or function of intrinsic factor.
Without sufficient intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 goes largely unabsorbed, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Deficiency in vitamin B12 can result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the production of fewer but larger red blood cells (macrocytes). Vitamin B12 deficiency can also result in nerve-related signs and symptoms (neuropathy), such as numbness and tingling that start first in the hands and feet, muscle weakness, slow reflexes, loss of balance and unsteady walking. Other disorders can cause vitamin B12 deficiency and result in megaloblastic anemia. When it is due to a lack of intrinsic factor, it is called pernicious anemia. Besides anemia, a decrease in the numbers of neutrophils and platelets (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) may also occur.
The tests for parietal cell and/or intrinsic factor antibodies may be used along with several other tests, such as complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear, to help diagnose pernicious anemia."

However, albumin may be detected in the urine even in the early stages of kidney disease. The urine albumin test (formerly called microalbumin) detects and measures the amount of albumin in the urine to screen for kidney disease.
Most of the time, tests for albumin and creatinine are done on a urine sample collected randomly (not timed) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is calculated. This is done to provide a more accurate indication of the how much albumin is being released into the urine. Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally released into the urine at a constant rate and its level in the urine is an indication of the urine concentration. This property of creatinine allows its measurement to be used to correct for urine concentration when measuring albumin in a random urine sample.
The presence of a small amount of albumin in the urine may be an early indicator of kidney disease. A small amount of albumin in the urine is sometimes referred to as urine microalbumin or microalbuminuria. ""Microalbuminuria"" is slowly being replaced with the term ""albuminuria,"" which refers to any elevation of albumin in the urine.
Plasma, the liquid portion of blood, contains many different proteins, including albumin. One of the many functions of the kidneys is to conserve plasma proteins so that they are not released along with waste products when urine is produced. There are two mechanisms that normally prevent protein from passing into urine: Specialized structures in the kidney called glomeruli are composed of loops of specialized capillaries that filter the blood, allowing small substances to pass through towards the urine, but provide a barrier that keeps most large plasma proteins inside the blood vessels.
The smaller proteins that do get through are almost entirely reabsorbed by tubes (tubules) that have a number of sections that collect the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomeruli. Protein in the urine (proteinuria) most often occurs when either the glomeruli or tubules in the kidney are damaged. Inflammation and/or scarring of the glomeruli can allow increasing amounts of protein to leak into the urine. Damage to the tubules can prevent protein from being reabsorbed.
If a person's kidneys become damaged or diseased, they begin to lose their ability to conserve albumin and other proteins. This is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, with increasing amounts of protein in the urine reflecting increasing kidney dysfunction.
Albumin is one of the first proteins to be detected in the urine with kidney damage. People who have consistently detectable small amounts of albumin in their urine (albuminuria) have an increased risk of developing progressive kidney failure and cardiovascular disease in the future."

Mycobacteria are called acid-fast bacilli because they are a group of rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) that can be seen under the microscope following a staining procedure where the bacteria retain the color of the stain after an acid wash (acid-fast). AFB laboratory tests detect the bacteria in a person's sample and help identify an infection caused by AFB.
There are several types of AFB that may be detected with this testing; however, the most common and medically important ones are members of the genus Mycobacterium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent and infectious species of mycobacteria.
Since TB is transmitted through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs, speaks, or sings, it is a public health risk. It can spread in confined populations, such as in the home and schools, correctional facilities, and nursing homes. Those who are very young, elderly, or have preexisting diseases and conditions, such as AIDS, that compromise their immune systems tend to be especially vulnerable. AFB testing can help diagnose, track, and minimize the spread of TB in these populations and help determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Another group of mycobacteria referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can also cause infections. However, only a few of the more than 60 species of mycobacteria that have been identified cause infections in humans. Some examples include Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), which can cause lung infection and disseminated disease in people with weakened immune systems. (See the article on Nontuberculous Mycobacteria for more details on different types). In addition to TB, AFB testing can help identify infections caused by these nontuberculous mycobacteria."

Sputum is phlegm, thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. Preferably, three early morning samples obtained by deep cough are collected on consecutive days in individual sterile cups to increase the likelihood of detecting the bacteria.
If a person is unable to produce sputum, a healthcare practitioner may collect respiratory samples using a procedure called a bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy allows the healthcare practitioner to look at and collect samples from the bronchi and bronchioles. Once a local anesthetic has been sprayed onto the patient's upper airway, the practitioner can insert a tube into the bronchi and smaller bronchioles and aspirate fluid samples for testing. Sometimes, the healthcare practitioner will introduce a small amount of saline through the tubing and into the bronchi and then aspirate it to collect a bronchial washing.
Since young children cannot produce a sputum sample, gastric washings/aspirates may be collected. This involves introducing saline into the stomach through a tube, followed by fluid aspiration.
If the healthcare practitioners suspect TB is present outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary), they may test the body fluids and tissues most likely affected. For instance, one or more urine samples may be collected if the practitioner suspects TB has infected the kidneys. A needle may be used to collect fluid from joints or from other body cavities, such as the pericardium or abdomen. Occasionally, the practitioner may collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or perform a minor surgical procedure to obtain a tissue biopsy."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/vancomycin,Vancomycin,[],[],"October 15, 2018.","November 20, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. This test measures the concentration of vancomycin in the blood.
Developed in the 1950s, vancomycin was originally prescribed primarily when organisms proved resistant to penicillin or when a person was allergic to penicillin. Its use declined with the introduction of other antimicrobials such as methicillin but has risen again with the emergence of certain strains of Staphylococcus, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
It is important to monitor the level of vancomycin because its effectiveness depends on sustaining blood levels at a minimum concentration for the duration of therapy. Furthermore, excessive concentrations of vancomycin must be avoided because high levels can result in serious side effects, specifically hearing (ototoxicity) and kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). The amount of vancomycin given per dose depends on a variety of factors, including kidney function, other nephrotoxic drugs the person may be taking, age, and weight.
Decreased kidney function may prevent efficient clearance of vancomycin from a person's system, resulting in increased concentration in the blood. If a person is given too little drug and is unable to maintain a sufficient minimum dose in the blood, then it is unlikely that treatment will be effective. The vancomycin test can be used to monitor the amount of drug in the blood to ensure that it remains at a therapeutic concentration – that is, adequate but not excessive.
Vancomycin is given intravenously (by injection into a vein) to treat infections such as septicemia, endocarditis, infection of the bone (osteomyelitis), some pneumonias, and meningitis. It is often the drug of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and MRSA infections, especially when they are associated with implanted prosthetic devices such as heart valves, artificial hips, and indwelling catheters. Vancomycin may also be given to some people before specific surgeries and dental procedures to prevent an infection.
Intravenous vancomycin administration is necessary to get the drug into circulation because vancomycin taken as a pill by mouth (oral) is poorly absorbed in the digestive tract. However, oral vancomycin may be prescribed to treat some infections of the digestive tract, where absorption into the circulating blood is not needed. An example is Clostridium difficile infection."

When a person takes a dose of vancomycin, the amount in the blood rises for a period of time, peaks, and then begins to fall, usually reaching its lowest level, or trough, just before the next dose. The next dose is timed to coincide with the falling concentration of the drug in the blood."

Some healthcare practitioners will order trough levels every few days throughout vancomycin treatment. Some will order both trough and peak concentrations at regular intervals. Many do not feel that general monitoring is necessary and will only order the tests for those who are at increased risk of kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), who are taking concurrent medications, who have decreased kidney function, or who are not responding to treatment as expected."

These enzymes play a role in the regulation of iron metabolism, formation of connective tissue, energy production within cells, the production of melanin (the pigment that produces skin color), and the function of the nervous system. This test measures the amount of copper in the blood, urine, or liver (hepatic).
Copper is found in many foods including nuts, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, whole grains, dried fruits, and liver. Drinking water may acquire copper as it flows through copper pipes, and food may acquire it when people cook or serve food in copper dishes. Normally, the body absorbs copper from food or liquids in the intestines, converts it to a non-toxic form by binding it to a protein, and transports it to the liver.
The liver stores some of the copper and binds most of the rest to another protein called apoceruloplasmin to produce the enzyme ceruloplasmin. About 95% of the copper in the blood is bound to ceruloplasmin, and most of the rest is bound to other proteins such as albumin.
Only a small amount is normally present in the blood in a free (unbound) state.
The liver eliminates excess copper into the bile and it is removed from the body in the stool. Some copper is also eliminated in the urine. Both excess and deficiency of copper are rare. Wilson disease, a rare inherited disorder, can lead to excess storage of copper in the eyes, liver, brain, and other organs. Copper excess (toxicity) can also occur with absorbing large amounts over a short period of time (acute exposure) or various amounts over a long period (chronic exposure).
Copper deficiency may occasionally occur in conditions associated with severe malabsorption, such as cystic fibrosis and celiac disease, and in infants exclusively fed cow-milk formulas. It can also occur in malnourished children as well as people who megadose zinc-containing vitamins.
A rare X-linked genetic condition called Menkes kinky hair syndrome leads to copper deficiency in the brain and liver of affected infants. The disease, which affects primarily males, is associated with seizures, delayed development, abnormal artery development in the brain, and unusual gray brittle kinky hair."

Usually, menopause is a gradual transition, beginning with a stage called perimenopause between the ages of 45 and 55. Menopause may also be triggered earlier in a woman’s life due to health conditions or medical procedures that affect the body’s production of or response to important hormones.
Before menopause, a woman’s hormones work together to release an egg from the ovaries and either regulate the monthly menstrual period or support the beginning of a pregnancy. During perimenopause, women begin to experience hormonal fluctuations. These hormonal fluctuations cause irregular menstrual periods and other symptoms of perimenopause including hot flashes, sleep problems, and vaginal changes."

The protein PCA3 and its associated mRNA are present at low levels in normal prostate tissue. PCA3 is present in increased amounts (over-expressed) in about 90% of prostate cancers. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is also produced in increased amounts by prostate cancers but can be increased in a number of benign conditions as well.
This test measures PCA3 mRNA and PSA mRNA in the first urine sample collected following a digital rectal exam (DRE). Laboratories report a score based on the ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA called the PCA3 score.
Prostate cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate, a small gland that encircles the urethra in men. Some men may choose to undergo screening for prostate cancer using a PSA blood test. An increased PSA level is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, but PSA can also be increased with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, infection, and a variety of other temporary conditions.
Diagnosis of prostate cancer requires performing a prostate biopsy and identifying cancer cells under the microscope. This biopsy may be done after an increased PSA result and/or an abnormal DRE. The accuracy of biopsies depends on the number of tissue samples and the sites from which they are taken. Since the biopsy takes small tissue samples, and since PSA is not cancer-specific, the initial biopsy is often negative.
A negative initial biopsy may leave the healthcare practitioner questioning whether the patient is truly cancer-free or if the cancer has been missed. Concerns over missing clinically significant cancer may prompt additional biopsies, especially if a repeat PSA is still elevated or has increased. However, each biopsy has potential complications, such as discomfort, blood in the urine (hematuria) or semen, rectal bleeding, difficulty urinating, infection, and in rare cases septicemia, so minimizing the number of biopsies performed is also desirable.
The PCA3 test can help determine if a repeat prostate biopsy would likely be positive and whether a man may avoid an unnecessary repeat biopsy. PCA3 is significantly over-expressed with prostate cancer but (unlike PSA) it is not affected by prostatitis or BPH."

Infections of the bloodstream are most commonly caused by bacteria (bacteremia) but can also be caused by yeasts or other fungi (fungemia) or by a virus (viremia). Although blood can be used to test for viruses, this article focuses on the use of blood cultures to detect and identify bacteria and fungi in the blood.
A blood infection typically originates from some other specific site within the body, spreading from that site when a person has a severe infection and/or the immune system cannot confine it to its source. For example, a urinary tract infection may spread from the bladder and/or kidneys into the blood and then be carried throughout the body, infecting other organs and causing a serious and sometimes life-threatening systemic infection. The terms septicemia and sepsis are sometimes used interchangeably to describe this condition. Septicemia refers to an infection of the blood while sepsis is the body's serious, overwhelming, and sometimes life-threatening response to infection. This condition often requires prompt and aggressive treatment, usually in an intensive care unit of a hospital.
Other serious complications can result from an infection of the blood. Endocarditis, an inflammation and infection of the lining of the heart and/or of the heart valves, can result from a bloodstream infection. People who have prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic joints have a higher risk of a systemic infection following their surgery, although these infections are not common.
Anyone with a weakened immune system due to an underlying disease, such as leukemia or HIV/AIDS, or due to immunosuppressive drugs such as those given for chemotherapy is at a higher risk for blood infections as their immune system is less capable of killing the microbes that occasionally enter the blood. Bacteria and yeasts may also be introduced directly into the bloodstream through intravenous drug use or through intravenous catheters or surgical drains.
For blood cultures, multiple blood samples are usually collected for testing and from different veins to increase the likelihood of detecting the bacteria or fungi that may be present in small numbers and/or may enter the blood intermittently. This is also done to help ensure that any bacteria or fungi detected are the ones causing the infection and are not contaminants.
Blood cultures are incubated for several days before being reported as negative. Some types of bacteria and fungi grow more slowly than others and/or may take longer to detect if initially present in low numbers.
When a blood culture is positive, the specific microbe causing the infection is identified and susceptibility testing is performed to inform the healthcare practitioner which antibiotics are most likely to be effective for treatment.
In many laboratories, the blood culture testing process is automated with instruments continuously monitoring the samples for growth of bacteria or fungi. This allows for timely reporting of results and for the healthcare practitioner to direct antimicrobial therapy to the specific microbe present in the blood. Because treatment must be given as soon as possible in cases of sepsis, broad-spectrum antimicrobials that are effective against several types of bacteria are usually given intravenously while waiting for blood culture results. Antimicrobial therapy may be changed to a more targeted antibiotic therapy once the microbe causing the infection is identified."

Multiple blood samples help to differentiate true pathogens, which will be present in more than one blood culture, from skin bacteria that may contaminate one of several blood cultures during the collection process.
Blood is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. The phlebotomist will put the blood into two culture bottles containing broth to grow microbes. These two bottles constitute one blood culture set. A second set of blood cultures should be collected from a different site, immediately after the first venipuncture. A single blood culture may be collected from children since they often have high numbers of bacteria present in their blood when they have an infection. For infants and young children, the quantity of each blood sample will be smaller and appropriate for their body size."

Coagulation factor tests measure the function of or sometimes the amount of these proteins in the blood.
Blood clotting is a complex process that involves numerous coagulation factors, which are produced by the liver and blood vessels. Each coagulation factor is evaluated with one or more tests. When factor levels are low, it can cause blood clotting to fail, leading to unexplained bleeding episodes. Measuring coagulation factors can help a healthcare practitioner determine the cause of the bleeding and the best treatment.
Coagulation factors are usually tested by measuring the factor's activity level in the blood. Activity assays can detect reduced levels of protein or proteins that don't function properly. Rarely, the amount (antigen level) of a coagulation factor may also be measured. Coagulation factor antigen tests can tell how much of the protein is present, but not whether its function is normal.
When someone bleeds (e.g., with an injury), the coagulation system is activated, plugging the leaking blood vessel with a clot. The coagulation system consists of a series of coagulation factors that activate in a step-by-step process called the coagulation cascade. The end result is the formation of insoluble fibrin threads that link together at the site of injury, along with aggregated cell fragments called platelets, to form a stable blood clot. The clot prevents additional blood loss and remains in place until the injured area has healed.
Blood clotting is dynamic; once a clot is formed, other factors are activated that slow clotting or dissolve the clot in a process called fibrinolysis. The clot is eventually removed after the injury site heals. In normal healthy individuals, this balance between clot formation and removal ensures that bleeding does not become excessive and that clots are removed once they are no longer needed.
For people with bleeding disorders, clotting does not work properly because they lack platelets or coagulation factors, or their platelets or factors don't work properly. There are a variety of bleeding disorders that may be passed through families (inherited) or acquired after birth. If a person has signs and symptoms of one of these disorders, coagulation factor testing may be ordered to help determine the diagnosis and treatment.
There are nine coagulation factor proteins that can be measured clinically (see table below). These factors are referred to by a name or Roman numeral or both in some cases. For example, coagulation factor II is also known as prothrombin. When one or more of these factors are produced in too small a quantity, or are not functioning correctly, they can cause excessive bleeding.  coagulation factor

It is used by healthcare practitioners to determine if the level of a coagulation factor is low or absent (below the detectable limit) or if it is too high. Low coagulation factor activity is associated with reduced clot formation and excess bleeding. High coagulation factor activity can be associated with too much clot formation (thrombosis) and blockade in the circulatory system (thromboembolism).

Results are frequently reported as a percentage with 100% being normal. For example, a factor VIII that is 30% would be considered abnormally low."

Influenza testing detects the presence of the virus in a sample of respiratory secretions.
Influenza tends to be seasonal, usually beginning in late fall and disappearing in early spring. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), influenza affects millions of Americans each season. Signs and symptoms like headache, fever, chills, muscle pains, exhaustion, a stuffy nose, sore throat, and a cough tend to be more severe and longer lasting than the symptoms caused by the common cold.
Two types of influenza virus, A and B, cause annual flu pandemics and most epidemics. Type C can cause mild respiratory illness and is not thought to cause epidemics. There are numerous subtypes of influenza A viruses, and they are named using two designations based on the antigenic components of the virus, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The most common influenza A viruses currently infecting humans have the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. (For more on this, see the condition article on Influenza.)
It is common for healthcare practitioners to diagnose and treat the flu without laboratory testing, especially during peak influenza season and when influenza has already been documented in an area. However, influenza testing can help rule out other illnesses and reduce the chances of people using unnecessary antibiotics, while increasing the chances that they will receive anti-viral therapy early in the illness, when it is most effective.
Also, if there is an outbreak of respiratory illness in a confined setting like a hospital, nursing home, or school, diagnostic testing will help determine the cause of the outbreak. Influenza testing also helps local and state health departments and the CDC track influenza in communities. Since the flu virus changes every year, testing also helps the CDC to monitor the subtypes and strains of flu that are circulating that year, to collect information for developing flu vaccines, and to monitor strains for resistance to anti-viral drugs."

The best sample is usually a nasal aspirate, but a swab from the nasopharynx or nasal secretions may also be used. In some circumstances, a healthcare practitioner may use a throat swab, but this contains less of the virus than a nasopharyngeal aspirate and so may not be appropriate for use in rapid testing where sensitivity is a concern.
For an aspirate, the person collecting the sample will use a syringe to push a small amount of sterile saline into the nose, then apply gentle suction to collect the resulting fluid (saline and mucus). To preserve the organisms in the sample, the sample is put into a special container, referred to as ""viral transport media"" or VTM, for delivery to the laboratory.
The nasopharyngeal swab is collected by having the person tip his or her head back, then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip®) is gently inserted into one of the nostrils until resistance is met (about 1 to 2 inches in), then rotated several times and withdrawn. This may tickle a bit and cause the eyes to tear."

Although most Alzheimer disease (AD) cases present after the age of 65, about 5-10% of cases present in people younger than 65 years of age. Much of this early onset AD is familial – it runs in family lines and is caused by a genetic mutation. So far, there have been three genes that have been identified as being associated with EOFAD: PSEN1, PSEN2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP).
Of these three genes, PSEN1 is the most commonly involved and is thought to cause about 20% to 70% of early onset AD. Since PSEN1-associated AD is dominantly inherited (autosomal dominant), it only takes one mutated copy, inherited from either the mother or father, to lead to the development of EOFAD.
Why PSEN1 mutations cause EOFAD is not completely understood. Scientists think that the normal role of the PSEN1 gene is to make the presenilin 1, a protein used in the development of the brain and spinal cord. Presenilin 1 also works with other enzymes to cut certain proteins into smaller pieces (amyloid beta peptides). A mutation in PSEN1 produces an abnormal presenilin 1 protein that no longer functions properly, resulting in a breakdown of this process. This can lead to increased production of a longer, stickier configuration of the amyloid beta protein, which is toxic to the nervous system and eventually forms the characteristic amyloid plaques seen in individuals with AD.
A wide variety of PSEN1 mutations have been identified in the families studied to date, and there is no common or high frequency mutation known. Some mutations may be more common in specific populations. Testing is more straightforward if a specific PSEN1 mutation has already been identified in a person's family line. The PSEN1 genetic mutation analysis is a relatively new test and is offered by a limited number of laboratories."

Testing detects either the West Nile virus directly or antibodies produced in response to WNV infection in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
West Nile virus is a member of the Flavivirus family, which includes viruses such as Zika, Yellow Fever, and Dengue. WNV also belongs to the Arboviruses group, which are transmitted to people by insects, such as mosquitoes. In 2014, a total of 2,204 cases of WNV disease were reported in the United States, including 1,347 cases affecting the central nervous system (neuroinvasive). More than half of the detected infections were from states of California or Texas.
In addition to birds, WNV may also be transmitted through contact with other infected animals, their blood, or other tissues. The virus is not passed through handling or consumption of infected birds or directly from person-to-person; however, there have been rare cases of WNV being transmitted to others through blood donations, organ transplants, and from a mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or through breast milk.
About 80% of people infected with WNV experience no symptoms. In the other 20%, it causes flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, muscular weakness, and/or a skin rash on the back or chest. These symptoms usually resolve without treatment within a few days to a few weeks.
Only about 1 in 150 people infected with WNV becomes seriously ill with an infection that affects the central nervous system. These people may experience severe symptoms, such as confusion, convulsions, high fever, neck stiffness, headaches, or a coma. They may have encephalitis and/or meningitis and/or may experience muscular paralysis. This serious form of WNV is much more common in the elderly, people with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), and individuals with underlying conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension). While most symptoms resolve within several weeks, some nerve damage and paralysis may linger or be permanent.
The two types of WNV testing include: Antibody testing—detects either IgM or IgG class of WNV antibodies

This test measures the level of lactoferrin in stool as a way to detect inflammation in the intestines.
Intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and with some bacterial infections of the digestive tract, but it is not associated with many other disorders that affect bowel function and cause similar symptoms. Lactoferrin can be used to help distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders characterized by swollen and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The cause of IBD is not known, but these diseases are thought to be due to an autoimmune process that has been triggered by a genetic predisposition, a viral illness, and/or an environmental factor. The most common inflammatory bowel diseases are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
People affected by IBD typically have flare-ups of active disease that alternate with periods of remission. During a flare-up, a person may experience frequent bouts of watery and/or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Between these flare-ups, symptoms frequently subside. Many people may go through extended periods of remission between flare-ups. Lactoferrin testing can be useful in monitoring disease activity."

CRP levels in the blood increase when there is a condition causing inflammation somewhere in the body. A CRP test measures the amount of CRP in the blood to detect inflammation due to acute conditions or to monitor the severity of disease in chronic conditions.
CRP is a non-specific indicator of inflammation and one of the most sensitive acute phase reactants. That means that it is released into the blood within a few hours after an injury, the start of an infection, or other cause of inflammation. Markedly increased levels can occur, for example, after trauma or a heart attack, with active or untreated autoimmune disorders, and with serious bacterial infections, such as in sepsis. The level of CRP can jump as much as a thousand-fold in response to bacterial infection, and its rise in the blood can precede pain, fever, or other signs and symptoms.
The CRP test is not diagnostic, but it provides information to your healthcare practitioner as to whether inflammation is present, without identifying the source of the inflammation. This information can be used in conjunction with other factors such as signs and symptoms, physical exam, and other tests to determine if you have an acute inflammatory condition or are experiencing a flare-up of a chronic inflammatory disease. Your healthcare practitioner may then follow up with further testing and treatment.
This standard CRP test is not to be confused with an hs-CRP test. These are two different tests that measure CRP and each test measures a different range of CRP level in the blood for different purposes: The standard CRP test measures high levels of the protein observed in diseases that cause significant inflammation. It measures CRP in the range from 8 to 1000 mg/L (or 0.8 to 100 mg/dL).
The hs-CRP test precisely detects lower levels of the protein than that measured by the standard CRP test and is used to evaluate individuals for risk of cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in the range from 0.3 to 10 mg/L. (See the article on hs-CRP.)"

It leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus and can cause recurrent respiratory infections and impaired function of the pancreas. The CF gene mutation panel detects the common mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7 to screen for or diagnose CF or to identify carriers of the disease.
Each cell in the human body (except sperm and eggs) has 46 chromosomes (23 inherited from the mother and 23 from the father). Genes on these chromosomes form the body's blueprint for producing proteins that control body functions.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in each of the two copies of the CFTR gene (one copy from each parent). Both copies (alleles) of this gene pair must be abnormal to cause CF. If only one copy is mutated, the individual is a CF carrier. Carriers do not generally have any CF symptoms, but they can pass their abnormal CF gene copy on to their children.
To date, more than 2,000 different mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified, but only a few of the mutations are common. The majority of cystic fibrosis cases in the U.S. are caused by a mutation called deltaF508 (F508).
Recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) have led to the adoption of a standard CF gene mutation panel. It includes 23 of the most common mutations (those with frequencies greater than 0.1% in the general U.S. population).
Some laboratories use expanded panels of up to 100 or more mutations designed to detect rare mutations particular to specific ethnic populations. These may provide slightly better sensitivity to detect mutations in some ethnic populations but are not recommended by ACOG for general screening. Some rare mutations are seen in only a few individuals and may not be detected with routine testing, even with an expanded panel.
In a CF gene mutation panel, the laboratory specifically examines the CFTR gene on each chromosome 7 for the 23 mutations. If the initial panel of mutations demonstrates a single mutation, additional testing for other less common mutations may be indicated if the individual is suspected of having CF."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/total-ige,Total IgE,['Quantitative IgE'],['Immunoglobulin E'],"June 1, 2016.","March 24, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that is produced by the body’s immune system in response to a perceived threat. It is one of five classes of immunoglobulins (A, G, M, D, and E) and is normally present in the blood in very small amounts. This test measures the amount of IgE in the blood.
Immunoglobulins are proteins that play a key role in the body's immune system. They are produced by specific immune cells called plasma cells. Immunoglobulins are produced in response to bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms as well as substances that are recognized as ""non-self"" or present harmful antigens to the immune system.
Immunoglobulin E is associated with allergic responses, including asthma, and to a lesser degree with immunity to parasites. With allergies, the body overreacts to one or more substances in the environment called allergens that do not typically cause a response in other people. Someone may develop an allergy when that person is exposed to an allergen, such as plant pollen, peanuts, eggs, strawberries, bee venom, and hundreds of other potential substances.
During an initial exposure, also called sensitization, an allergic person produces an IgE specifically directed against that allergen. IgE binds to specialized white blood cells, resulting in the release of a number of substances, including histamine. In allergic/asthmatic people, this can cause constriction of the bronchi in the lungs. These substances are also responsible for the running nose, itchy eyes, and skin itching that occur in people with allergies.
Each time an allergic person is exposed to a specific allergen(s) after the initial exposure, IgE is rapidly produced, increasing to levels that trigger an allergic reaction. The severity of the reaction and symptoms associated with each episode can range from a localized reddening and itching of the skin, to respiratory distress, to vomiting and diarrhea, and in some cases to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Severity will vary from person to person, can vary from episode to episode, and may worsen over time.
The total IgE test measures the overall quantity of immunoglobulin E in the blood, not the amount of a specific type. It can be used to detect an allergic response in the body rather than a specific allergy. This test may compliment the information provided by allergy tests that detect allergen-specific IgE."

This test measures the amount of C-peptide in a blood or sometimes a urine sample.
In the pancreas, within specialized cells called beta cells, proinsulin, a biologically inactive molecule, is split apart to form one molecule of C-peptide and one molecule of insulin. Insulin is vital for the transport of glucose into the body's cells and is required on a daily basis. When insulin is released from the beta cells into the blood in response to increased levels of glucose, equal amounts of C-peptide are also released. Since C-peptide is produced at the same rate as insulin, it is useful as a marker of insulin production.
In particular, C-peptide testing can be used to help evaluate the production of insulin made by the body (endogenous) and to help differentiate it from insulin taken in as diabetic medication (exogenous) which not generate C-peptide.

The thrombin time assesses the activity of fibrinogen.
When an injury occurs and bleeding begins, the body begins to form a clot at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Small cell fragments called platelets adhere to, aggregate, and are activated at the injury site. At the same time, the coagulation cascade begins and proteins called coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, are activated. Fibrinogen is then converted by thrombin into insoluble threads called fibrin that crosslink together to form a fibrin net that adheres to the injury site. Along with the platelets adhering, this forms a stable blood clot and prevents additional blood loss, remaining in place until the injury has healed.
For a stable clot to form, there must be enough normally functioning platelets and coagulation factors. If there are dysfunctional factors or platelets, or too few of them, it can lead to bleeding episodes and/or to inappropriate blood clotting (thrombosis).
The thrombin time evaluates that part of the hemostatic process where soluble fibrinogen is changed into fibrin threads. It measures the time required for a fibrin clot to form following the addition of a standard amount of thrombin to plasma. It is affected by the level and/or function of fibrinogen and the presence of inhibitors (e.g., heparin, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, direct thrombin inhibitor). With the addition of thrombin to the test sample, the thrombin time bypasses the rest of the coagulation factors and focuses on the function of fibrinogen.
It is now understood that blood coagulation tests are based on what happens artificially in the test setting (in vitro) and thus do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, there are several laboratory tests used to evaluate specific components of the hemostasis system. (For more on this, see the explanation of the Coagulation Cascade)."

Since thrombin time, but not reptilase time, is affected by the anticoagulant heparin, prolongation of both thrombin time and reptilase time indicates decreased fibrinogen level and/or abnormal function of fibrinogen. If thrombin time is prolonged but reptilase time is normal, heparin contamination or presence of an interfering substance is likely the cause.

It is a specific rearrangement of genetic material from two separate chromosomes (chromosomal translocation) and is associated with a specific type of leukemia. This test detects and measures PML-RARA in the blood or bone marrow to determine if an individual has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes, including 22 pairs of non-sex-determining chromosomes (also known as autosomes) and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males). The genetic makeup of a person is contained on her/his chromosomes. The genes that reside on chromosomes form the blueprints for the production of thousands of proteins. Sometimes changes can occur to a person's chromosomes and/or genes during their lifetime because of exposures to radiation, toxins, or for unknown reasons. These exposures could lead to gene mutations or to chromosome translocations.
The PML-RARA fusion gene sequence is one such acquired change (mutation) that is formed when pieces of chromosome 15 and chromosome 17 break off and switch places (translocate). The PML gene region in chromosome 15 then fuses with the RARA gene region in chromosome 17. This is referred to as reciprocal translocation, and this particular one is commonly expressed as t(15;17).
Normally, the PML gene codes for a protein that helps prevent uncontrolled cell growth and acts as a tumor suppressor. The RARA gene codes for a protein that is crucial for white blood cell (WBC) maturation, as these cells typically develop through several stages in the bone marrow before release into circulation. The mutated PML-RARA fusion gene codes for an abnormal fusion protein that does neither of these functions but instead leads to the uncontrolled production and accumulation of leukemic WBCs that do not mature or differentiate beyond the promyelocyte stage. As a large number of these abnormal cells start to crowd out the normal blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, signs and symptoms of leukemia start to emerge.
Up to 98% of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic t(15;17) PML-RARA reciprocal chromosomal translocation. In about 2% of APL cases, other translocations involving the RARA gene and genes other than PML have been reported.
Testing detects the PML-RARA fusion gene or its transcripts, the RNA copies made by the cell from the abnormal gene sequence of DNA. The presence of the PML-RARA abnormality helps confirm the diagnosis of APL.
Testing can also direct APL therapy and monitor minimal residual disease, which could be fatal. Treatment of APL typically involves all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a drug that binds to retinoic acid receptors in cells. The drug can overcome the effect of the abnormal PML-RARA protein and induce downstream signaling and maturation of WBCs. This therapy works well in conjunction with chemotherapy but only in those cases where the PML-RARA fusion gene is present. The treatment results in remission in about 80-90% of these patients, according to the American Cancer Society. A small percentage of people with APL have a fusion between the RARA gene and a different gene, and they may or may not benefit from ATRA therapy based upon the specific gene involved."

The test analyzes the genes of the HIV strain infecting you to identify mutations that may cause the virus to be resistant to ART.
ART is intended to suppress the amount of HIV virus (viral load) in order to decrease the risk of the disease progressing. However, you may be initially infected with a drug-resistant HIV strain or drug resistance may develop during treatment, causing ART to be ineffective in suppressing the virus.
In general, drug resistance describes the condition in which a microbe (e.g., virus, bacteria) is able to survive, grow and/or multiply in the presence of one or more antimicrobial drugs. Resistance can develop when antimicrobials are used to treat an infection and a mutation or change occurs in one of the microbe's genes. This change leads to a mixed population in your body – some microbes that are drug-resistant and some that are drug-sensitive. Microbes without the mutation are killed, but those that have the mutation quickly multiply and begin to predominate. This is called ""selective pressure"" because the drug ""selects"" and allows the growth of the microbes that are resistant to it. When this occurs, the antimicrobial is no longer effective in treating your infection.
HIV mutates frequently – even in the absence of drug treatment – but not every mutation causes resistance to ART. With genotypic resistance testing, the genetic code of the HIV you have been infected with is analyzed to determine if there are any genetic mutations that are known to cause ART resistance.
To avoid the development of ART resistance, it is recommended that individuals with HIV be treated with a combination of drugs that are from two different classes of antiretroviral drugs. This is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART. There are many different antiretroviral drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For more on this, visit the National Institute of Health's web page on FDA-Approved HIV Medicines."

Any wound may become infected with a variety of bacteria. A culture helps to determine whether a wound has become infected, which type(s) of bacteria are causing the infection, and which antibiotic would best treat the infection and help heal the wound.
Wounds may be superficial breaks in the skin such as scrapes, cuts and scratches or may involve deeper tissues such as incisions, bites, punctures or burns. (Read the article on Wound and Skin Infections.) A culture is performed by collecting a sample of fluid, cells or tissue from the wound and placing it on or in appropriate nutrient media. The media encourages the growth of bacteria that may be present, allowing for further testing and identification.
Typically, only one kind of pathogenic bacteria is causing the infection in a wound. However, there may be several types of normal skin bacteria present in the culture. Separating the various types of bacteria and identifying the pathogenic bacteria requires one or more days to perform.
A Gram stain is usually performed to help determine the type of bacteria present and provide a rapid result to the healthcare practitioner. The shape and color (morphology and staining characteristics) also help determine what other tests may need to be performed to definitively identify the cause of infection.
Because the results of the stain read under the microscope are not definitive, further tests such as biochemical reactions or mass spectrometry must be performed to identify the bacteria. Mass spectrometry using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) can provide an identification to the genus and species level in less than an hour after the bacterial colony is grown on the culture media. This technique significantly decreases the time needed to identify bacteria from traditional biochemical reactions that require overnight incubation.
For many of the pathogens identified in wound cultures, testing is done to determine which antibiotics will be effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria (see Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing). The Gram stain of the wound, the culture, and susceptibility testing all contribute to inform the healthcare practitioner which pathogen(s) are present and what antibiotic therapy is likely to inhibit their growth."

Although there are several possible causes of blood in the stool, one important cause is the presence of polyps or cancers in the digestive tract.
Colon polyps are common as people age, but most polyps do not cause any health problems and are benign. However, a benign polyp can turn into a cancerous polyp and the cancer may even spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). If detected early, colon cancer can be successfully treated. It is therefore important to determine whether pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps are present.
Polyps are finger-like growths that protrude into the cavity (lumen) of the colon or the rectum. They can be fragile and bleed intermittently, such as when food waste brushes against them. This blood is mixed in with the stool and when the amounts are small, the blood can only be detected by tests for occult blood. This small amount of blood may be the first and sometimes the only sign of polyps or early colon cancer, making the stool-based tests valuable screening tools.
There are two principal methods for detecting occult blood in the stool. They are designed to detect hemoglobin, a molecule that is present in red blood cells. Hemoglobin has two essential parts: a chemical part called heme and a protein part called globin. Each method tests for a different part of the hemoglobin molecule. The Immunochemical method (FIT) tests for the globin (protein) part of hemoglobin and FITs are designed to specifically detect human globin. FIT generally will not detect globin from non-human blood such as found in beef and other meats, thereby making them superior to other tests. Hemoglobin from bleeding in the upper digestive tract is broken down before it reaches the lower digestive tract and so upper GI bleeds are not usually detected by the FIT. However, most health organizations, including the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society recommend this test for screening for colon cancer."

Hepatitis C tests are a group of tests that are performed to diagnose hepatitis C infection and to guide and monitor treatment of the infection.
Hepatitis C tests include: HCV antibody test—detects antibodies in your blood that are produced in response to an HCV infection
HCV RNA test—detects and measures viral hepatitis C RNA in the blood
HCV genotype test—determines the specific subtype of the virus; this information is useful in guiding treatment. Hepatitis C is one of five viruses identified so far, including A, B, D, and E, that are known to cause hepatitis.
HCV is spread when contaminated blood enters the body, primarily though sharing needles and syringes during IV drug use. HCV is spread less commonly by sharing personal items contaminated with blood (e.g., razors, toothbrushes), through sex with an infected person, needlestick injuries to healthcare workers, unregulated tattooing, and from mother to baby during pregnancy and childbirth. Before tests for HCV became available in the 1990s, HCV was often transmitted by blood transfusions. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C. Acute hepatitis C—for some people, infection with HCV is a short-term illness, usually with few, mild symptoms or no symptoms, and the virus is cleared from the body without specific treatment. Occasionally (about 20 to 30% of the time), this acute stage of infection can cause more severe symptoms, particularly jaundice and fatigue.
Chronic hepatitis C—more than half of people infected develop chronic hepatitis C that, without treatment, can lead to serious, long-term health problems like cirrhosis and liver cancer, and may be fatal. Chronic hepatitis progresses slowly over time, so infected individuals may not be aware they have the condition until it causes enough liver damage to affect liver function. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were approximately 44,700 cases of acute hepatitis C in the U.S. in 2017 and that there are 2.4 million people in the U.S. living with chronic hepatitis C. Many of these people don't know they are infected. The only way to know is to get tested for hepatitis C.
If you are diagnosed with hepatitis C, your healthcare practitioner may recommend an antiviral treatment to cure your infection or refer you to a healthcare practitioner who specializes in treating liver diseases or infectious diseases. The HCV RNA test may be repeated prior to starting treatment to determine whether the virus is still present and your infection persists, and also to provide a baseline to compare to during treatment.
There are several antiviral treatments available to treat hepatitis C. While some treat specific types (genotypes) of the virus, there are some that treat all genotypes. Treatment typically involves taking medication by mouth (oral) for about 8 to 12 weeks, although it can be longer in some cases. These medications can cure over 90% of people with chronic hepatitis C with relatively few side effects. Your infection is considered cured if you have no detectable HCV in your blood 12 weeks after completing treatment."

It detects the presence of antibodies to the virus in your blood that are produced by the immune system in response to infection. This test cannot distinguish whether you have an active or a previous HCV infection. There is some evidence that if your test is ""weakly positive,"" it may be a false positive. The CDC recommends that all positive antibody tests be followed by an HCV RNA test (see below) to determine whether or not you have an active infection. 	The HCV antibody test may be performed as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel to determine which of the most common hepatitis viruses is causing your symptoms. HCV RNA test, Quantitative (HCV viral load) detects and measures the amount of viral RNA in your blood. This test may be used:"

Liver tests such as ALT and AST may be used to detect ongoing liver injury. You will likely be checked to see if you are immune to hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and if not, you will be offered vaccination, since infection with these other viruses can further damage your liver. Other tests such as albumin, prothrombin time, and bilirubin can also be used. They are typically normal unless you have developed cirrhosis. Sometimes a liver biopsy may be performed to determine the severity of liver damage. If you are going to be treated, you will be checked for exposure or infection with hepatitis B virus, as HCV treatment can cause a flare-up of hepatitis B."

Now, treatments for HCV can cure over 90% of people with hepatitis C before late complications occur, but even those with advanced liver disease often respond to treatment. This increases the opportunity to intervene early and prevent HCV-associated deaths. According to the CDC, recent treatment guidelines recommend monitoring people with acute HCV but only considering treatment if the infection persists longer than 6 months."

Chromosomes are thread-like structures within each cell nucleus and contain the body's genetic blueprint. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes in specific locations. These genes are responsible for a person’s inherited physical characteristics and they have a profound impact on growth, development, and function.
Humans have 46 chromosomes, present as 23 pairs. Twenty-two pairs are found in both sexes (autosomes) and one pair (sex chromosomes) is present as either XY (in males) or XX (in females). Normally, all cells in the body that have a nucleus will contain a complete set of the same 46 chromosomes, except for the reproductive cells (eggs and sperm), which contain a half set of 23. This half set is the genetic contribution that will be passed on to a child. At conception, half sets from each parent combine to form a new set of 46 chromosomes in the developing fetus.
Chromosomal abnormalities include both numerical and structural changes. For numerical changes, anything other than a complete set of 46 chromosomes represents a change in the amount of genetic material present and can cause health and development problems. For structural changes, the significance of the problems and their severity depends upon the chromosome that is altered. The type and degree of the problem may vary from person to person, even when the same chromosome abnormality is present.
A chromosomal karyotyping examines a person's chromosomes to determine if the right number is present and to determine if each chromosome appears normal. It requires experience and expertise to perform properly and to interpret the results. While theoretically almost any cells could be used to perform testing, in practice it is usually performed on amniotic fluid to evaluate a fetus and on lymphocytes (a white blood cell) from a blood sample to test all other ages. Alternately, white blood cells may be obtained from bone marrow aspirations to look for changes in individuals suspected of having hematologic or lymphoid diseases (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, refractory anemia).
The test is performed by: Taking a sample of a person's cells, culturing them in nutrient-enriched media to promote cell division in vitro. This is done in order to select a specific time during the cells' growth phase when the chromosomes are easiest to distinguish.
Isolating the chromosomes from the nucleus of the cells, placing them on a slide, and treating them with a special stain.
Taking microphotographs of the chromosomes.
In jigsaw puzzle fashion, rearranging the pictures of the chromosomes to match up pairs and arrange them by size, from largest to smallest, numbers 1 to 22, followed by the sex chromosomes as the 23rd pair.
The pictures also allow the chromosomes to be vertically oriented. Each chromosome looks like a striped straw. It has two arms that differ in length (a short arm (p) and a long arm (q)), a pinched-in area between the arms called a centromere, and a series of light and dark horizontal bands. The length of the arms and the location of the bands help determine top from bottom.
Once the chromosome photo arrangement is completed, a laboratory specialist evaluates the chromosome pairs and identifies any abnormalities that may be present. Some chromosomal disorders that may be detected include: Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), caused by an extra chromosome 21; this may occur in all or most cells of the body.
Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), a condition associated with severe mental retardation; caused by an extra chromosome 18.
Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13), caused by an extra chromosome 13.
Klinefelter syndrome, the most common sex chromosome abnormality in males; caused by an extra X chromosome.
Turner syndrome, caused by missing one X chromosome in females.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia, a classic 9;22 translocation that is diagnostic of the disease. (See Related Images below)"

It is one of several various causes of hepatitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and enlargement of the liver. This test detects antibodies in the blood that are produced by the immune system in response to a hepatitis A infection.
Hepatitis A is one of five ""hepatitis viruses"" identified so far, including B, C, D, and E, that are known to cause the disease. While hepatitis A can cause a severe, acute disease that typically lasts 1 to 2 months, it does not cause a chronic infection as do some of the other hepatitis viruses.
Hepatitis A is spread, most commonly, from person-to person through stool (fecal) contamination or by ingesting food or water contaminated by the stool of an infected person (a foodborne illness). Recognized risk factors for hepatitis A include close contact with an infected person, international travel, household or personal contact with a child who attends a child care center, household or personal contact with a newly arriving international adoptee, a recognized foodborne outbreak, men who have sex with men, and use of illegal drugs.
Although there are many causes of hepatitis, the symptoms remain the same. In hepatitis, the liver is damaged and unable to function normally. It cannot process toxins or waste products such as bilirubin for their removal from the body. During the course of the disease, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels in the blood can increase. While tests such as bilirubin or a liver panel can tell a healthcare practitioner that someone has hepatitis, they do not identify the cause. Antibody tests for hepatitis viruses may help determine the cause.
There are two different classes of hepatitis A antibody that may be tested, IgM and IgG. When a person is exposed to hepatitis A, the body first produces hepatitis A IgM antibodies. These antibodies typically develop 2 to 3 weeks after first being infected (and are detectable before the onset of symptoms) and persist for about 3 to 6 months. Hepatitis A IgG antibodies are produced within 1 to 2 weeks of the IgM antibodies and usually persist for life. (See below for more details.)
A vaccine that prevents hepatitis A has been available since 1995. Historically, infection rates varied cyclically, with nationwide increases every 10-15 years. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hepatitis A rates have declined by more than 95% since the vaccine first became available. In 2015, the number of acute hepatitis A cases reported nationwide was an estimated 2,800."

These are antibodies produced by a person's own immune system that target his or her own histones. Histones are proteins that are a part of chromatin, the genetic material present in the nucleus of almost all cells within the body. Because histones are found inside cells, this attack on ""self"" can cause symptoms throughout the body. This test detects the presence of histone antibodies in the blood.
Histone autoantibodies are one of several types of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). ANA are associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. The presence or absence of specific antinuclear antibodies is used to help determine which disorder a person may have.
Drugs can stimulate the production of histone antibodies in some people and can cause a type of lupus called drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Up to 95% of those with drug-induced lupus will have histone antibodies. The autoantibodies may also develop in up to 50% of those with non-drug-induced lupus and in 20% of those with other connective tissue diseases.
Many drugs have been associated with drug-induced lupus in some people. Some of the more common examples include: Hydralazine
Isoniazid
Minocycline
Penicillamine
Procainamide
Quinidine Other types of medications associated with drug-induced lupus include: Antibiotics
Anti-seizure medications
Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents

There are two separate cholinesterase enzymes in the body: (1) acetylcholinesterase, found in red blood cells as well as in the lungs, spleen, nerve endings, and the gray matter of the brain, and (2) pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase), found in the serum as well as the liver, muscle, pancreas, heart, and white matter of the brain. Cholinesterase tests measure the activity of these enzymes.
Acetylcholinesterase is involved in transmission of nerve impulses by breaking down acetylcholine, a chemical that helps to transmit signals across nerve endings. A decrease in the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase results in excess acetylcholine at nerve endings. This can lead to overstimulation of nerves within body tissues and organs. Pseudochlinesterase is involved in processing and metabolizing drugs.
The two most common reasons for testing activity levels in the blood are: Organophosphate pesticide exposure. Insecticides containing organophosphates can inhibit cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase activity. Symptoms can be severe with acute exposure to these pesticides or can gradually appear with chronic exposure. Absorption can occur by inhalation, ingestion, or contact with the skin. Testing red blood cell acetylcholinesterase and serum pseudocholinesterase may be done to detect acute poisoning or to monitor those with occupational exposure to these chemicals, such as farm workers or those who work with industrial chemicals.
Inherited pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Some individuals have an inherited deficiency due to a genetic variant of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. This enzyme is used by the body to inactivate (metabolize) succinylcholine, a muscle relaxant that is commonly used during surgery. People who have low levels or defective pseudocholinesterase may experience prolonged effects of the drug, with protracted muscle paralysis and apnea following anesthesia. In addition, those who are homozygous for genetic variants may be at greater risk of adverse effects than those who are heterozygous. Pseudocholinesterase testing can be performed prior to surgery on those with a family history of prolonged apnea after use of succinylcholine to determine if they are at risk of complications related to this drug."

Most of the PSA that the prostate produces is released into this fluid, but small amounts of it are also released into the blood. PSA exists in two main forms in the blood: complexed (cPSA, bound to other proteins) and free (fPSA, not bound). The most frequently used PSA test is the total PSA, which measures the sum of cPSA and fPSA in the blood.
The PSA test may be used as a tumor marker to screen for and to monitor prostate cancer. The goal of screening is to detect prostate cancer while it is still confined to the prostate. However, most experts agree that screening should be done on asymptomatic men only after thorough discussions with their healthcare practitioners on the benefits and risks and after informed decisions are made to undergo screening. Elevated blood levels of PSA are associated with prostate cancer, but they may also be seen with inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PSA levels tend to increase in all men as they age, and men of African American heritage may have levels that are higher than other men, even at earlier ages.
PSA is not diagnostic of cancer. The gold standard for identifying prostate cancer is the prostate biopsy, collecting small samples of prostate tissue and identifying abnormal cells under the microscope. An elevated PSA may be followed by a biopsy, which has risk of complications such as pain, fever, blood in the urine, or urinary tract infection. (Read the article on Anatomic Pathology for more information on biopsies.) The total PSA test and digital rectal exam (DRE) are used together to help determine the need for a prostate biopsy.
Once the presence of prostate cancer is confirmed by biopsy, another decision must be made with regard to treatment. Prostate cancer is relatively common in men as they age and many, if not most, of the tumors are very slow-growing. While prostate cancer is the number two cause of cancer death in men, the slow-growing type is an uncommon cause of death and may never cause symptoms. A pathologist may be able to help differentiate between slow-growing cases and cancers that are likely to grow aggressively and spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).
Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of prostate cancer are issues with which health practitioners are currently grappling. In some cases, the treatment can be worse than the cancer, with the potential for causing significant side effects such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The PSA test and DRE cannot, in general, predict the course of a person's disease. The free PSA test is sometimes used to help determine if a biopsy should be done when the total PSA is only slightly elevated."

As these tests becomes more widely available, they may aid some men and their healthcare practitioners in decisions about their future care: PCA3—PCA3 is a protein produced only in the prostate gland. The test measures the urine level of PCA3 messenger RNA (m-RNA), a signal from genes that tells the prostate to produce the PCA3 protein. Increased amounts of the m-RNA (over-expressed) are produced by 95% of prostate cancer cells, so an elevated level may help to indicate that a prostate cancer is present."

This test measures the amounts of metanephrine and normetanephrine that are released into the urine over a 24-hour period.
Catecholamines are produced by the adrenal glands (as hormones), small triangular organs located on top of each kidney, and by cells of the sympathetic nervous system (called neurotransmitter substances or neurotransmitters). The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are released in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate small air passages in the lungs called bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, which increases blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism).
After completing their actions, the catecholamines are broken down to form inactive compounds. Epinephrine breaks down into metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and norepinephrine becomes normetanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Catecholamines and their breakdown products are normally present in the urine in small fluctuating amounts that increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation.
However, rare tumors of the adrenal gland called pheochromocytomas and rare tumors outside the adrenal glands called paragangliomas can produce large amounts of catecholamines and their metabolites, resulting in greatly increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. (These syndromes are often grouped together and abbreviated as PPGL). This can cause persistent or episodic periods of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include heart palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and the symptoms may worsen. Over time, the hypertension caused by the excess hormones may cause kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
Although they are rare, it is important to diagnose and treat these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of catecholamines being produced and to reduce or eliminate associated symptoms and complications."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/opioid-testing,Opioid Testing,[],[],"March 15, 2018.","April 20, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Opioids are a class of drugs that are used to reduce pain (narcotic analgesics). Opioid testing is used to confirm the presence of opioids in the urine, blood, saliva, hair, or sweat.
Opioids include opiates that are derived from natural sources (e.g., heroin and morphine) and semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl). Testing methods may detect only a few opiates or may include testing for a large number of specific opioids.
Opioid tests may be ordered for medical reasons, for example, to determine compliance with opioid prescription medications, to determine adherence to a chemical dependency rehabilitation program, or for legal reasons, for example, as part of a court-ordered probation requirement.
Opioid addiction is currently an epidemic and is considered a public health emergency in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999. To combat opioid addiction, the CDC's 2016 guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain include annual urine testing to monitor patients for signs of opioid misuse and/or diversion. Most medical guidelines recommend that patients prescribed opioids for longer than 90 days be urine drug tested at least annually and prior to starting therapy.
People who use opioids may ingest, inhale, smoke, or inject them. The effect of an opioid depends on the particular opioid used, the amount used, its purity, and the method of use, such as whether it is taken in tablet form or injected.
To test for opioids, healthcare practitioners may send urine samples to a laboratory for screening or they may perform a test in their office. Testing may be performed as point-of-care tests, which are typically small strips that are dipped into the urine and interpreted by the appearance of a colored line on the strip. Most tests will detect the drug in urine if someone has taken an opioid in the previous 1 to 3 days, but this timeframe depends on the specific opioid consumed and the individual's ability to metabolize the drug.
Some opioids may be difficult to detect with the routine screening tests because the test may not be designed to detect the specific drug of interest. Healthcare practitioners may identify which opioid they want to detect when they order the test. Often, laboratories will offer a pre-determined panel test that will include several individual screens that target commonly prescribed opioids. The following table lists some examples of opioids or opioid metabolites that may be tested.  Opioid Type
Examples
Opiates (from natural sources)
Codeine, morphine, heroin and heroin metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine)
Semi-synthetic opioids
Hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone
Synthetic opioids
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, tapentadol
Other drugs loosely referred to as opioids (antagonists and agonist/antagonist)
Buprenorphine, naloxone, naltrexone  Positive screening tests are presumptive. This is because some screening tests have the potential for false-positive results. Therefore, screening tests that are positive are often confirmed with a second test that identifies the exact substance that is present. Confirmatory tests are usually more sensitive than screening tests and will detect lower levels of specific opioids. Confirmatory testing is usually performed with an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Types of mass spectrometry tests used for confirmatory testing include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Both screening and confirmatory tests are interpreted based on a cut-off. If a drug is not present, or if the drug is present at a concentration below the test cut-off, the test will be reported as ""undetected,"" ""absent"" or ""negative."" If a drug is present at a concentration equal to or above the cutoff, the test will be reported as ""detected,"" ""present"" or ""positive.""
Testing may also be performed to identify whether anything has been added to the urine sample, such as water, bleach or other types of chemicals (adulterants) that may have been added in an attempt to interfere with the test. If adulteration is suspected, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.
Urine samples may also be identified as dilute. Dilute urine may be produced if an individual consumes large amounts of water or other liquids prior to testing. Dilute urine may also result from some medical conditions. If an individual adds liquid such as water to a urine sample, this may also cause dilute urine. It may not always be possible to determine how the urine was diluted. If the urine is so dilute that the results are not reliable, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated."

Complement tests measure the amount or activity of complement proteins in the blood.
The complement system's principal role is to help identify, destroy and remove foreign pathogens like bacteria and viruses, as well as damaged ""self"" materials (e.g., cells and proteins). The complement system is so named because it “complements” or aids the natural body defenses, such as antibodies. So, the complement system is also activated when the body makes antibodies, whether against itself or foreign invaders. The body makes antibodies against its own tissues that it thinks are foreign (autoantibodies) in various autoimmune diseases.
The complement system is part of the body's innate immune system. Unlike the acquired immune system, which produces antibodies that target and protect against specific threats, the innate immune system is non-specific and can quickly respond to foreign substances. It does not require previous exposure to an invading microbe or offending substance and does not maintain a memory of previous encounters.
There are nine primary complement proteins that are designated C1 through C9. These components, in addition to the remaining proteins, work together in a cascade-like approach by activating, amplifying, breaking apart, and forming protein complexes that respond to infections, ""non-self"" tissues (e.g., transplants), dead cell debris (e.g., from apoptosis), or inflammation.
The complement cascade consists of 3 separate pathways that may be activated to converge in a final common pathway. The pathways include the ""classical pathway"" (including components C1qrs, C2, C4), the ""alternative pathway"" (including components C3, factor B, properdin), and the ""lectin pathway"" (a.k.a. mannan-binding lectin [MBL]). The end result of all three activation pathways is the same – the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation causes several things to happen (""complement cascade""): The MAC binds to the surface of each microbe, abnormal cell, or substance that has been targeted for destruction. It creates a lesion (hole) in the membrane wall and causes lysis, which is destruction of the cell by letting the contents out – like piercing a water-filled balloon.
It increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing infection-fighting white blood cells (WBCs) to move out of the bloodstream and into tissues.
It attracts WBCs to the site of the infection.
It stimulates phagocytosis, a process in which microbes are engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils and killed.
It also labels immune complexes with complement components so that WBCs will engulf them and clear them out of the blood. Complement tests measure the amount or the function (activity) of complement proteins in the blood. Complement components may be measured individually or together to determine whether the system is functioning normally. C3 and C4 are the most frequently measured complement proteins. Total complement activity can be measured if a healthcare practitioner suspects a deficiency that is not measured by C3 or C4. The CH50 functional test measures the function of the complete classical complement pathway, mediated by components C1 – C9. If this measurement is outside the normal range, then each of the nine different complement levels can be measured individually to look for hereditary or acquired deficiencies."

As electrically charged particles, electrolytes help move nutrients into and wastes out of the body's cells, maintain a healthy water balance, and help stabilize the body's acid/base (pH) level.
The electrolyte panel measures the blood levels of the main electrolytes in the body: Sodium—most of the body's sodium is found in the fluid outside of the body's cells, where it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body.
Potassium—this electrolyte is found mainly inside the body's cells. A small but vital amount of potassium is found in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. Potassium plays an important role in regulating muscle contraction. Monitoring potassium is important as small changes in the potassium level can affect the heart's rhythm and ability to contract.
Chloride—this electrolyte moves in and out of the cells to help maintain electrical neutrality (concentrations of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions must be equal) and its level usually mirrors that of sodium. Due to its close association with sodium, chloride also helps to regulate the distribution of water in the body.
Bicarbonate—the main job of bicarbonate (or total CO2, an estimate of bicarbonate), which is released and reabsorbed by the kidneys, is to help maintain a stable pH level (acid-base balance) and, secondarily, to help maintain electrical neutrality. Bicarbonate also plays an important role in the transport of CO2: much of the CO2 produced by the body's tissues is transported in the blood as bicarbonate to the lungs, where it is exhaled. The foods you eat and the fluids you drink provide the sodium, potassium, and chloride your body needs. The kidneys help maintain proper levels by reabsorption or by elimination into the urine. The lungs provide oxygen and regulate CO2. The CO2 is produced by the body and is in balance with bicarbonate. The overall balance of these chemicals is an indication of the functional well-being of several basic body functions. They are important in maintaining a wide range of body functions, including heart and skeletal muscle contraction and nerve signaling.
Any disease or condition that affects the amount of fluid in the body, such as dehydration, or affects the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing has the potential to cause a fluid, electrolyte, or pH imbalance (acidosis or alkalosis). Normal pH must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45 and electrolytes must be in balance to ensure the proper functioning of metabolic processes and the delivery of the right amount of oxygen to tissues. (For more on this, see the condition articles on Acidosis and Alkalosis and Dehydration.)
A related ""test"" is the anion gap, which is a value calculated using the results of an electrolyte panel. It reflects the difference between the positively charged ions (called cations) and the negatively charged ions (called anions). An abnormal anion gap is non-specific—it does not diagnose a specific disease or illness—but it can suggest certain kinds of metabolic or respiratory disorders or the presence of toxic substances. For more information on anion gap, see Common Questions below.
While sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate are commonly measured together as the electrolyte panel, they can also each be ordered individually for diagnosis/monitoring of conditions that affect specific electrolytes. The body also contains other electrolytes that are not part of the ""electrolyte panel"" but may also be ordered by your healthcare practitioner. These include: calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and phosphate (PO43-)."

It is normally undetectable or detectable at a very low level unless the body is forming and breaking down blood clots. Then, its level in the blood can significantly rise. This test detects D-dimer in the blood.
When a blood vessel or tissue is injured and begins to bleed, a process called hemostasis is initiated by the body to create a blood clot to limit and eventually stop the bleeding. This process produces threads of a protein called fibrin, which crosslink together to form a fibrin net. That net, together with platelets, helps hold the forming blood clot in place at the site of the injury until it heals.
Once the area has had time to heal and the clot is no longer needed, the body uses an enzyme called plasmin to break the clot (thrombus) into small pieces so that it can be removed. The fragments of the disintegrating fibrin in the clot are called fibrin degradation products (FDP), which consist of variously sized pieces of crosslinked fibrin. One of the final fibrin degradation products produced is D-dimer, which can be measured in a blood sample when present. The level of D-dimer in the blood can significantly rise when there is significant formation and breakdown of fibrin clots in the body.
For a person who is at low or intermediate risk for blood clotting (thrombosis) and/or thrombotic embolism, the strength of the D-dimer test is that it can be used in a hospital emergency room setting to determine the likelihood of a clot's presence. A negative D-dimer test (D-dimer level is below a predetermined cut-off threshold) indicates that it is highly unlikely that a thrombus is present. However, a positive D-dimer test cannot predict whether or not a clot is present. It indicates that further diagnostic procedures are required (e.g., ultrasound, CT angiography).
There are several factors and conditions associated with inappropriate blood clot formation. One of the most common is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which involves clot formation in veins deep within the body, most frequently in the lower legs. These clots may grow very large and block blood flow in the legs, causing swelling, pain, and tissue damage. It is possible for a piece of the clot to break off and travel to other parts of the body. This ""embolus"" can lodge in the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolus or embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolisms from DVT affect more than 300,000 people in the U.S. each year.
While clots most commonly form in the veins of the legs, they may also form in other areas as well. Measurements of D-dimer can be used to help detect clots in any of these sites. For example, clots in coronary arteries are the cause of myocardial infarction (heart attacks). Clots may form on the lining of the heart or its valves, particularly when the heart is beating irregularly (atrial fibrillation) or when the valves are damaged. Clots can also form in large arteries as a result of narrowing and damage from atherosclerosis. Pieces of such clots may break off and cause an embolus that blocks an artery in another organ, such as the brain (causing a stroke) or the kidneys.
Measurements of D-dimer may also be ordered, along with other tests, to help diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition in which clotting factors are activated and then used up throughout the body. This creates numerous tiny blood clots and at the same time leaves the affected person vulnerable to excessive bleeding. It is a complex, sometimes life-threatening condition that can arise from a variety of situations, including some surgical procedures, sepsis, poisonous snake bites, liver disease, and after childbirth. Steps are taken to support the affected person while the underlying condition resolves. The D-dimer level will typically be very elevated in DIC."

TB primarily targets the lungs but may affect any area of the body such as the urinary tract, central nervous system, bones, joints, and/or other organs. TB screening tests help to determine whether a person has become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. A TB skin test measures the body's immune response to antigens derived from these bacteria.
TB may cause an inactive (latent) infection or an active, progressive disease. The immune system of about 90% of people who become infected with TB manages to control its growth and confine the TB infection to a few cells in the body. The bacteria in these cells are inactive but still alive. The person does not have any symptoms and is not infectious but does have a ""latent TB infection.""
If, after some time, the immune system of an individual with an inactive infection becomes weakened (compromised), the mycobacteria may begin to grow again, leading to an active case of tuberculosis disease. Active TB does cause illness and can be passed to others through respiratory secretions such as sputum or aerosols released by coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking, singing, or breathing.
A tuberculin skin test cannot distinguish between latent and active infections. Additional tests, such as AFB testing, are required to help establish a diagnosis of an active TB infection."

A healthcare practitioner will wipe the inner forearm with alcohol and let the skin dry. Using a 1cc syringe and a tiny needle, the healthcare practitioner will then inject a small amount of PPD solution just under the first layer of the skin. When done correctly, the injection forms a small bubble of fluid that looks like a blister. The site should be left uncovered and undisturbed.

If not processed and cleared from the body appropriately, excess ammonia can accumulate in the blood. This test measures the amount of ammonia in the blood.
Ammonia is normally transported in the blood to the liver, where it is converted into two substances called urea and glutamine. The urea is then carried to the kidneys, where it is eliminated in the urine. If this ""urea cycle"" does not complete the breakdown of ammonia, ammonia builds up in the blood and can pass from the blood into the brain.
Ammonia is toxic to the brain. For example, when liver function is significantly reduced due to disorders such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, ammonia and other compounds processed by the liver can accumulate in the brain and cause a condition called hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy causes mental and neurological changes that can lead to confusion, disorientation, sleepiness, and eventually to coma and even death.
Infants and children with increased ammonia levels may vomit frequently, be irritable, and be increasingly lethargic. Left untreated, they may experience seizures, have difficulty breathing, and may lapse into a coma.
Problems with ammonia processing can arise from conditions such as: Severe liver disease – damage limits the ability of the liver to process ammonia; spikes in ammonia blood levels may be seen in people with stable liver disease, especially following a triggering event such as gastrointestinal bleeding or an electrolyte imbalance.
Decreased blood flow to the liver – ammonia is less able to get to the liver to be processed.
Reye syndrome – a rare condition that affects the blood, brain, and liver; it typically causes a rise in ammonia levels and a fall in glucose. It affects primarily children and young adults. In most cases, it follows and appears to be triggered by a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Children who are given aspirin are at an increased risk.
Kidney (renal) failure – the kidneys are unable to effectively rid the body of urea, leading to a build-up of ammonia in the blood.
Rare genetic disorder such as a defect in the urea cycle – a deficiency in one of the enzymes necessary to complete the conversion of ammonia to urea."

These particles are essential and carry a combination of proteins, vitamins, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid molecules. The composition of a lipoprotein particle changes as it circulates in the blood. Some molecules are removed and others are added, resulting in lipoprotein particles with variable amounts of cholesterol.
Low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) are bi-products of fat transport that remain in circulation for an extended time. While in circulation, LDL-P can penetrate the artery wall and get stuck, forming a fatty plaque. These plaques can build over time and lead to blockages, resulting in heart attacks and strokes. The likelihood of an LDL-P getting trapped in the artery wall increases when more LDL-P are in the blood.
Traditional lipid testing measures the amount of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) present in the blood, but it does not evaluate the number of LDL particles (LDL-P). LDL-P is often used to get a more accurate measure of LDL due to the variability of cholesterol content within a given LDL. Studies have shown that LDL-P more accurately predicts risk of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C. Researchers think that increased LDL-P could be one of the reasons that some people have heart attacks even though their total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are not particularly high."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/phenytoin,Phenytoin,[],"['Phenytoin, total and free']","October 3, 2018.","September 22, 2020.",What is being tested?,"This test measures the amount of phenytoin in the blood.
Phenytoin is a drug prescribed to treat or prevent the recurrence of certain types of seizures (see Epilepsy), including complex partial seizures (impaired consciousness that is preceded, accompanied, or followed by psychological symptoms) or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (involve abrupt loss of consciousness, respiratory arrest, muscle rigidity). It has been widely used in the United States since its development in 1938. It is still being prescribed but is beginning to be replaced by newer drugs. Phenytoin may be used alone or with phenobarbital or other anticonvulsants.
Phenytoin blood testing is ordered because phenytoin blood levels must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If levels are too low, the affected person may experience seizures; if they are too high, the person may experience symptoms associated with phenytoin toxicity. These may include loss of balance and falling, involuntary eye movement from side to side (nystagmus), confusion, slurred speech, tremors, and low blood pressure.
Maintaining a therapeutic level of phenytoin in the blood can be a challenge due to several reasons: The absorption rates vary among different preparations of the drug.
Phenytoin is metabolized by the liver enzymes. Enzymes in the liver process phenytoin at rates that differ from person to person and are affected by age (children metabolize it more quickly while the elderly metabolize it more slowly) and by the health of the liver. When the body has reached its capacity to process phenytoin, small increases in the dose can cause large increases in blood concentration, increasing the severity of side effects and causing phenytoin toxicity.
Most phenytoin is bound to protein in the bloodstream. But it is the unbound ""free"" portion that is active. If a person has a lower than normal amount of protein in their blood, such as low albumin in liver failure or in elderly, then the person may have an excess of active phenytoin.
A number of drug interactions could cause alteration of phenytoin levels. Phenytoin's total effect can be unpredictable. Dosages must be adjusted slowly until a steady concentration in the blood is reached. The time to attain a steady-state level of phenytoin may vary from several days to several weeks because of substantial variations among patients in the amount of time it takes to metabolize phenytoin. Healthcare practitioners must also watch for side effects and adverse reactions during initial dosage adjustment and over time. In some cases, the severity of side effects may make it necessary to consider treating a patient with an alternative anti-seizure medication."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/pharmacogenetic-tests,Pharmacogenetic Tests,[],['Pharmacogenomics'],"July 24, 2016.","May 4, 2021.",What is pharmacogenetics?,"Some of us respond differently than others to the same medications that we take, or we may experience different side effects from drugs. The way we respond can be due to the genes we have inherited. With respect to drugs, our unique genetic make-up and our individual response may mean that a drug that is effective for one person may be less effective for another or that a drug that is safe for one person may be less safe for another person—even at the same dosage.
Most drugs are broken down (metabolized) in the body by various enzymes. In some cases, an active drug is made inactive (or less active) through metabolism. In other cases, an inactive (or less active) drug is made more active through metabolism. The challenge in drug therapy is to make sure that the active form of a drug stays around long enough to do its job. However, some people have variable enzyme action so that they may metabolize the drug too quickly or too slowly or not at all — meaning that the drug may not produce its intended effect or it may remain in a person's system too long and may lead to side effects.
Individual response to a drug may also be related to variability in the drug target, for example a protein that the drug binds to in order to produce its specific effect. Furthermore, individuals may experience side effects (known as hypersensitivity reactions) from certain medications due to variability in proteins involved in the immune response.
Pharmacogenetics is the study of genetic variability that causes individual responses to medications. By analyzing the genes that produce the specific drug targets or enzymes that metabolize a medication or are associated with immune response, a healthcare practitioner may decide to raise or lower the dose or even change to a different drug. The decision about which drug to prescribe may also be influenced by other drugs the person is taking in order to avoid drug-drug interactions.
The terms ""pharmacogenetics"" and ""pharmacogenomics"" are sometimes used interchangeably. There are subtle differences in the meaning of the two terms and there is no consensus on the exact definitions. In general, pharmacogenomics refers to the overall study of the many various genes that contribute to drug response. Pharmacogenetics is the study and evaluation of the inherited differences (genetic variations) that affect drug metabolism and an individual's response to medications. For the purposes of this article, the term pharmacogenetics will be used."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/pharmacogenetic-tests,Pharmacogenetic Tests,[],['Pharmacogenomics'],"July 24, 2016.","May 4, 2021.",Why is pharmacogenetics important?,"When initiating drug therapy to treat a particular condition, healthcare practitioners typically prescribe one of several appropriate drugs. Dosages and timing of drugs are usually based upon the anticipated rate of metabolism and clearance from the body in the average person. They prescribe a ""standard"" dose based on factors such as weight, sex, and age. Clinically, however, each person responds uniquely to treatment and healthcare practitioners must make adjustments. For example, the healthcare practitioner may adjust the drug dose or switch to a different therapy, depending on whether the person's condition is responding to the medication and whether the individual is experiencing unpleasant or dangerous side effects. Sometimes a person may find that a treatment that has been working well suddenly causes symptoms when that person starts taking an additional drug."

Each person has two copies of most genes: one copy is inherited from the person's mother and one copy is inherited from the person's father. Each gene is made up of a specific genetic code, which is a sequence of nucleotides (A, T, G, or C). For each nucleotide position in the gene, one of the four nucleotides is the predominant nucleotide in the general population. This nucleotide is usually referred to as ""wild type."" If an individual has a nucleotide that is different from ""wild type"" in one copy of his or her genes, that person is said to have a heterozygous variant. If an individual has the same variant nucleotide in both copies of his or her genes, that person is said to have a homozygous variant."

The results of the testing may be combined with the individual's clinical information, including age, weight, health and other drugs that they are taking, to help tailor therapy. Sometimes, the healthcare practitioner may use this information to adjust the medication dose or sometimes to choose a different drug.

This test measures the amount of haptoglobin in the blood.
Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein complex that transports oxygen throughout the body. It is normally found within red blood cells (RBCs) and very little is found free circulating in the blood. Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin in the blood. This forms a haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex that is rapidly cleared out of circulation by the liver so that it can be broken down and the iron recycled. Formation of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex also prevents hemoglobin from being filtered by the kidneys and passed into the urine, which can be toxic to the kidneys.
However, when an increased number of RBCs are damaged and/or break apart (hemolysis), they release their hemoglobin into the blood, increasing the amount of free hemoglobin in circulation. When large numbers of RBCs are destroyed, haptoglobin levels in the blood will temporarily decrease as the haptoglobin is used up faster than the liver can produce it. A decrease in the amount of haptoglobin may be a sign that you have a condition that is causing red blood cells to be destroyed or to break apart. When the binding capacity of haptoglobin is exceeded, the free hemoglobin level in circulation goes up and may cause tissue damage and/or organ dysfunction due to oxidative stress of free hemoglobin.
Increased RBC destruction may be due to inherited or acquired conditions. Some examples include transfusion reactions, certain drugs, and mechanical breakage, such as may be seen with some prosthetic heart valves. The destruction may be mild or severe, occurring suddenly (acute) or developing and lasting over a long period of time (chronic), and it can lead to hemolytic anemia. People with hemolytic anemia may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath and their skin may be pale or jaundiced.
Liver disease may also result in decreased haptoglobin levels as liver damage may inhibit both the production of haptoglobin and the clearing of the haptoglobin-free hemoglobin complexes."

It works in conjunction with several other female hormones. This test measures the level of progesterone in the blood.
On a monthly basis, the hormone estrogen causes the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, to grow and replenish itself, while a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) leads to the release of an egg from one of two ovaries (ovulation). A corpus luteum then forms in the ovary at the site where the egg was released and begins to produce progesterone. This progesterone, supplemented by small amounts produced by the adrenal glands, stops endometrial growth and readies the uterus for the possible implantation of a fertilized egg.
If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone levels drop, and menstrual bleeding begins. If a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone, with the egg forming a trophoblast that produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). After several weeks, the placenta replaces the corpus luteum as the main source of progesterone, producing relatively large amounts of the hormone throughout the rest of a normal pregnancy.

The BMP provides information on your blood sugar (glucose) level, the balance of electrolytes and fluids, and the health of your kidneys. Abnormal results, and especially combinations of abnormal results, can indicate a problem that needs to be addressed and may require additional testing.
The BMP includes the following tests: Glucose – the primary energy source for the body's cells; a steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively stable level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.
Calcium – one of the most important minerals in the body; it is essential for the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart and is required in blood clotting and in the formation of bones. Electrolytes—these are minerals found in body tissues and blood in the form of dissolved salts. Electrolytes help move nutrients into the body's cells and remove wastes out of cells. They help maintain a healthy water balance and help stabilize the body's acid/base (pH) level. The following 4 tests are commonly called electrolytes: Sodium – vital to normal body function, including nerve and muscle function
Potassium – vital to cell metabolism and muscle function, helping to transmit messages between nerves and muscles
Bicarbonate (Total CO2) – helps to maintain the body's acid-base balance (pH)
Chloride – helps to regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance Kidney Tests Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) – waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys; as kidney function decreases, BUN level rises.
Creatinine – waste product produced in the muscles; it is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys so blood levels are a good indication of how well the kidneys are working."

Two separate tests for these proteins are often performed together as part of the investigation of a possible excessive clotting disorder. The tests measure the amount of each protein (antigen tests) and evaluate whether they are performing their proper functions (activity tests).
Normally, when a body tissue or blood vessel wall is injured, a process called hemostasis begins to form a plug at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Small cell fragments called platelets adhere to and aggregate at the site and a coagulation cascade begins as proteins called coagulation factors are activated one after the other. Eventually, a stable clot forms, preventing additional blood loss and remaining in place until the injured area has healed. The clot is then broken down when it is no longer needed. There must be an adequate amount of platelets and sufficient clotting factors and each must function normally in order for a stable clot to form.
Proteins S acts as a principal cofactor to protein C. The two work together to help regulate and control blood clot formation by inactivating specific coagulation factors (factors V and VIII) that are required to generate and form blood clots. This has the net effect of slowing down clot formation, much like brakes slow a speeding car. Therefore, if there is not enough protein C or S or they are not functioning normally, clot formation can go unchecked, possibly leading to excessive clotting. These conditions can range from mild to severe.
Deficient or dysfunctional protein C or protein S may be due to an underlying condition (acquired), such as liver disease, kidney disease, severe infections or cancer, or can be inherited, passed from parent to child. Both protein C deficiency and protein S deficiency are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. About 1 out of every 200-500 people has one normal gene and one abnormal gene (heterozygous), causing protein C deficiency. About 1 in 500 people have protein S deficiency due to heterozygous gene mutation.
There are two types of inherited protein C deficiencies: Type 1 is related to insufficient quantity.
Type 2 is related to abnormal function and is less common than Type 1. Protein S exists in two forms in the blood: free and bound to another protein, but only the free protein S is available to be a cofactor for protein C. There are three types of inherited protein S deficiencies: Type 1 deficiency is due to an insufficient quantity.
Type 2 is due to abnormal function.
Type 3 is due to decreased free protein S levels, though total protein S levels are normal."

In healthy individuals, levels of AST in the blood are low. When liver or muscle cells are injured, they release AST into the blood. This makes AST a useful test for detecting or monitoring liver damage or related infections and some side effects of medications.
The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right-hand side of the abdominal area just beneath the rib cage. It is involved in many important functions in the body. The liver helps to process the body's nutrients, manufactures bile to help digest fats, produces many important proteins such as blood clotting factors, and breaks down potentially toxic substances into harmless ones that the body can use or excrete. It also helps metabolize some medications.
A number of conditions can cause injury to the liver and may cause increases in AST. The test is most useful in detecting liver damage due to hepatitis, drugs toxic to the liver, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. AST, however, is not specific for the liver and may be increased in conditions affecting other parts of the body.
An AST test is often performed along with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test. Both are enzymes found in the liver that become elevated in the blood when the liver is damaged. A calculated AST/ALT ratio is useful for differentiating between different causes of liver injury and in recognizing when the increased levels may be coming from another source, such as heart or muscle injury."

Intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and with some bacterial GI infections, but it is not associated with many other disorders that affect bowel function and cause similar symptoms. Calprotectin can be used to help distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders characterized by inflamed and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The cause of IBD is not known, but these diseases are thought to be due to an autoimmune process that has been triggered by a genetic predisposition, a viral illness, and/or an environmental factor. The most common inflammatory bowel diseases are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
People with IBD typically have flare-ups of active disease that alternate with periods of remission. During a flare-up, a person may experience frequent bouts of watery and/or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Between these flare-ups, symptoms frequently subside. Many people may go through extended periods of remission between flare-ups. Calprotectin testing can be useful in monitoring disease activity.

They are continually produced in small quantities in the heart and released in larger quantities when the heart senses that it needs to work harder. This supports fluid retention and volume expansion in the arteries and veins. Subsequently, the heart muscle is stretched and works hard to pump blood under normal resting condition. Tests for BNP and NT-proBNP measure their levels in the blood in order to detect and evaluate heart failure. The two tests are not interchangeable and should not be used together. Your healthcare practitioner should order one or the other but not both.
It is important to note that heart failure is an incorrect term. The heart still pumps blood, it just has difficulty doing so. If your healthcare practitioners treat you for heart failure, they have several approaches depending upon the severity of the disease.
BNP was initially called brain natriuretic peptide because it was first found in brain tissue (and to distinguish it from a similar protein made in the atria, or upper chambers, of the heart, termed ANP). BNP is actually produced primarily by cells in the left ventricle of the heart. The left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber and is responsible for sending oxygenated blood from the lungs to the remainder of the body. It is associated with blood volume and pressure and with the work that the heart must do in pumping blood throughout the body. Small amounts of a precursor protein, pro-BNP, are continuously produced by the heart. Pro-BNP is then split by the enzyme called corin to release the active hormone BNP and an inactive fragment, NT-proBNP, into the blood.
When the left ventricle of the heart is having difficulty pumping sufficient amounts of blood to the body, the concentrations of BNP and NTproBNP produced can increase markedly. This may occur with many diseases that affect the heart and circulatory system. The increase in circulating BNP or NT-proBNP will reflect this diminished capacity to deliver oxygenated blood to the body."

Your healthcare practitioner may decide that you may be tested without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted."

The other three are high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and chylomicrons. Each particle contains a mixture of cholesterol, triglyceride, and protein, but in varying amounts unique to each type of particle. LDL contains the highest amount of cholesterol. HDL contains the highest amount of protein. VLDL and chylomicrons contain the highest amount of triglyceride.
VLDL particles are released into the blood by the liver and circulate in the bloodstream, ultimately being converted into LDL as they lose triglyceride, having carried it to other parts of the body. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines ATP III, there is growing evidence that VLDL plays an important role in atherogenesis, in which plaques form on the interior walls of arteries, narrowing these passageways and restricting blood flow, which can lead to heart disease and increase the risk of stroke.
Currently, direct measurement of VLDL cholesterol requires specialized testing. However, since VLDL-C contains most of the circulating triglyceride (if a person is fasting) and since the composition of the different particles is relatively constant, it is possible to estimate the amount of VLDL-C based on the triglyceride value. To estimate VLDL-C, divide the triglyceride value by 5 if the value is in mg/dL or divide by 2.2 if the value is in mmol/L. In most cases, this formula provides a good estimate of VLDL-C.
However, this formula becomes less accurate with increased triglyceride levels when, for example, a person has not fasted before having blood drawn. The calculation is not valid when the triglyceride level is greater than 400 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/L) because other lipoproteins are usually present. In this situation, VLDL-C may be measured directly using specialized testing."

They are formed from very large cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate. The platelet count is a test that determines the number of platelets in your sample of blood.
When there is an injury to a blood vessel or tissue and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding in three ways. They: Adhere to the injury site
Clump together (aggregate) with other platelets
Release chemical compounds that stimulate aggregation of other platelets These steps result in the formation of a loose platelet plug at the site of the injury in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This secondary hemostasis process results in the formation of strands of fibrin that weave through the loose platelet plug, form a fibrin net, and compress to form a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed. When the clot is no longer needed, other factors break the clot down and remove it.
Each component of the clotting process must be present, activated at the right time, and functioning properly for adequate clotting. If there is an insufficient number of platelets or if the platelets are not functioning normally, a stable clot may not form and you may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding.
Platelets survive in the circulation about 8 to 10 days, so the bone marrow must continually produce new platelets to replace those that degrade, are used up, and/or are lost through bleeding. Determining the number of platelets in blood with a platelet count can help diagnose a range of disorders having to do with too few or too many platelets."

These calculations can give your healthcare practitioner additional information about your platelets and the cause of a high or low platelet count. Larger platelets are usually younger platelets that have been released earlier than normal from the bone marrow, while smaller platelets may be older and have been in circulation for a few days. MPV reflects the average size of your platelets. A high number of large platelets (high MPV) and a low platelet count suggests your bone marrow is producing platelets and releasing them into circulation rapidly. An elevated MPV has been associated with poorer survival rates in certain cancers. Conversely, a low MPV indicates platelets are smaller than average and are older. This may be due to a disorder affecting production by the bone marrow. A low MPV has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease, chemotherapy, and aplastic anemia."

These may be seen in certain disorders such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura or in rare inherited disorders such as Bernard-Soulier disease. However, it may be necessary for a laboratory professional to use a microscope to examine a blood smear to determine whether the platelets are truly giant or if the platelets clumped together during the testing process. If platelets are clumping, repeat testing may be performed using a different collection tube containing a different anticoagulant that prevents or minimizes platelet clumping."

Because of the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the World Health Organization declared that the outbreak was a global pandemic in March of 2020.
The health effects of COVID-19 can vary widely. Some people infected with the virus are asymptomatic and may not feel sick. Others develop mild symptoms or severe and potentially life-threatening effects."
https://labtestsonline.org/coronavirus-covid-19-testing,Coronavirus (COVID-19) Testing,[],[],"May 13, 2021.","June 18, 2021.",Who should get testing?,"The type of test and a person’s individual circumstances affect who should get COVID-19 testing.
Diagnostic testing for an active infection is warranted in people who have symptoms that are consistent with COVID-19.
Screening tests in asymptomatic people can be conducted in many different contexts. These tests are most often recommended when a person has been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 or has been in a situation with an elevated risk of virus exposure such as a large social gathering.
Screening tests may be utilized in other circumstances such as:  For residents and workers in shared living environments, especially if some individuals are vulnerable to severe illness with COVID-19. Examples of these potentially high-risk environments include nursing homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters.
For all people admitted to the hospital, especially if there is significant community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
For patients prior to surgeries or other medical procedures.
For patients who are being prescribed drugs that could suppress their immune system.
For employees or students who are often in close contact to detect asymptomatic cases as part of health programs to reduce virus transmission.  Monitoring of patients can also employ tests for active infection. It is important to note, though, that a positive result on a repeat test does not always mean that a person is contagious, and likewise, a follow-up negative test result does not always mean that the individual is no longer contagious.
There are not clear guidelines for who should receive testing for past infection. Many serologic tests are conducted as part of epidemiological studies about the number of people with prior infections. An antibody test may also be appropriate in patients who have health concerns that could be late-developing complications of COVID-19.
With all of these test types, especially tests for active infections, available resources are an important factor in determining who should be tested. If testing capacity is limited, public health officials and health care providers may establish guidelines to prioritize the use of tests in specific patients or circumstances.
Talking with a doctor is the best way to determine if you should receive a coronavirus test, and, if so, which test is the best fit for your situation. It is especially important to talk with your doctor promptly if you have symptoms of COVID-19.
Getting test results
How you get test results and how long it takes to receive them varies based on the type of test: Tests that require laboratory analysis usually have results available within a few business days, although some of these tests can be performed more quickly. Results are normally provided by your doctor’s office or sent electronically and/or by mail.
Point-of-care tests are designed for rapid analysis without sending a sample to a laboratory. For these tests, results are often available in minutes or hours. Results may be delivered by a health care provider or sent directly to you either electronically or by mail.
Many at-home tests allow for your sample to be analyzed right after taking the test sample. You see the results yourself, and they are normally available in less than an hour.  High demand for testing may affect the time required to receive some test results. Reduced test availability and strained laboratory capacity may create delays in analyzing test samples."

The RBC count totals the number of red blood cells that are present in your sample of blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC) and is often used in the general evaluation of a person's health.
Blood is made up of a few different types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to RBCs, there are white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream as they mature. RBCs typically make up about 40% of the blood volume. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and enables RBCs to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. RBCs also help transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, from those tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled.
The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect RBC production and some conditions may result in significant bleeding. Other disorders may affect the lifespan of RBCs in circulation, especially if the RBCs are deformed due to an inherited or acquired defect or abnormality. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the RBC count. Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level. If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues.
If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia. This can cause thicker blood, decreased blood flow and related problems, such as headache, dizziness, problems with vision, and even excessive clotting or heart attack."

It makes up about 60% of the total protein in the blood and plays many roles. This test measures the level of albumin in the blood.
Albumin keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, nourishes tissues, and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, and substances like calcium throughout the body. Levels of albumin may decrease, to a greater or lesser degree, when conditions interfere with its production by the liver, increase protein breakdown, increase protein loss via the kidneys, and/or expand the volume of plasma, the liquid portion of blood (diluting the blood).
Two important causes of low blood albumin include: Severe liver disease—since albumin is produced by the liver, its level can decrease with loss of liver function; however, this typically occurs only when the liver has been severely affected.
Kidney disease—one of the many functions of the kidneys is to conserve plasma proteins such as albumin so that they are not released along with waste products when urine is produced. Albumin is present in high concentrations in the blood, and when the kidneys are functioning properly, virtually no albumin is lost in the urine. However, if a person's kidneys become damaged or diseased, they begin to lose their ability to conserve albumin and other proteins. This is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. In nephrotic syndrome, very high amounts of albumin are lost through the kidneys."

Antigen/antibody test: Antigens are foreign substances that activate an immune response. Antigens appear before the body produces antibodies, so HIV antigen/antibody tests can detect an HIV infection earlier than antibody tests, within 2 to 4 weeks of becoming infected.
HIV viral load test: An HIV viral load test looks for the quantity of HIV virus in the blood. In addition to detecting an HIV infection, viral load testing can also detect how much of the virus is in the blood. Although this type of testing can detect an HIV infection earlier than other HIV tests, it’s very expensive and is typically only used when someone has symptoms or a possible exposure to HIV."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/androstenedione,Androstenedione,['AD'],[],"April 27, 2017.","November 13, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Androstenedione is an androgen, one of several ""male"" sex hormones that are responsible for the onset of sexual differentiation in males and females and the development of secondary male physical characteristics such as a deep voice and facial hair. Though it is considered to be a ""male"" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women and is a precursor that can be converted by the body into more potent androgens, such as testosterone, or converted into the female hormone estrogen. This test measures the amount of androstenedione in the blood.
Androstenedione is produced by the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and by the adrenal glands in both. The pituitary hormone LH stimulates the release of androstenedione by the ovaries and testicles.
The pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the release of androstenedione by the adrenal glands. The level of androstenedione in the blood will vary during the day in a ""diurnal pattern,"" and it will vary during a woman's menstrual cycle. Because of its origins, androstenedione can be useful as a marker of adrenal gland function, of androgen production, and of the function of the ovaries or testicles. An androstenedione test is often performed after results of other tests, such as testosterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, are found to be abnormal.
An excess level of androstenedione and other androgens can cause children to have sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous external genitalia), excess body hair (hirsutism), and abnormal menstrual periods in girls and precocious (early) puberty in girls and boys.
Adrenal tumors, ACTH-producing tumors, and adrenal hyperplasia can lead to the overproduction of androstenedione. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have higher levels of androstenedione as well. While elevated levels may not be noticed in adult men, they can lead to noticeable male physical characteristics (virilization) and a lack of monthly menstrual periods (amenorrhea) in females."

It has various causes, one of which is infection by a virus. HBV is one of five ""hepatitis viruses"" identified so far that are known to mainly infect the liver. The other four are hepatitis A, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E.
HBV is spread through contact with blood or other body fluids from an infected person. Exposure can occur, for example, through sharing of needles for IV drug use or through unprotected sex. People who live in or travel to areas of the world where hepatitis B is prevalent are at a greater risk. Mothers who are infected can pass the infection to their babies, usually during or after birth. The virus is not spread through casual contact such as holding hands, coughing or sneezing. However, the virus can survive outside the body for up to seven days, including in dried blood, and can be passed by sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person.
Effective hepatitis B vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1981, and beginning in 1991, healthcare providers in the U.S. began vaccinating infants at birth. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 850,000 and 2.2 million people in the U.S. are chronically infected with the virus, most of whom are not aware that they are infected.
The course of HBV infections can vary from a mild form that lasts only a few weeks to a more serious chronic form lasting years. Sometimes chronic HBV leads to serious complications such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. Some of the various stages or forms of hepatitis B include: Acute infection — presence of typical signs and symptoms with a positive HBV test
Chronic infection — persistent infection with the virus detected by laboratory tests accompanied by inflammation of the liver
Carrier state — persistent infection (determined by HBV tests) but no liver inflammation (a carrier is someone who may appear to be in good health but harbors the virus and can potentially infect others)
Resolved or inactive infection — no longer has any evidence of infection; viral antigen and DNA tests are negative and no signs or symptoms of liver inflammation (although, in many cases, the virus is present in an inactive state in the liver and can potentially reactivate)
Reactivation — return of HBV infection (detected by HBV tests) with liver damage in a person who was a carrier or who had a resolved, inactive infection. This most commonly occurs in persons treated with chemotherapy for cancer or with drugs that suppress the immune system used to treat autoimmune diseases or following an organ transplant. It also can occur during treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in people who also had been exposed to HBV in the past. Though a potentially serious infection, acute HBV infection usually resolves on its own in most adults. Infants and children tend to develop a chronic infection more often than adults. Approximately 90% of infants infected with HBV will develop a chronic condition. For children between the ages of one and five, the risk of developing chronic hepatitis drops to between 25% and 50%. Over the age of five, less than 5% of HBV infections become chronic.
The vast majority of those with chronic infections will have no symptoms. For acute infections, the symptoms (when present) are very similar to those of other types of acute hepatitis, although no symptoms occur in over half of those with acute HBV infection. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. With acute hepatitis, the liver is damaged and is not able to function normally. It may not process toxins or waste products such as bilirubin for their removal from the body. During the course of disease, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels in the blood may increase. While tests such as bilirubin or a liver panel can tell a healthcare practitioner that someone has hepatitis, they will not indicate what is causing it. Tests that detect infection with a hepatitis virus may help determine the cause."

They have been refined to indicate the degree of risk: borderline, intermediate, or high risk.
Perhaps the most important indicators for cardiac risk are your personal health history. These include: Age
Family history
Weight
Cigarette smoking
Blood pressure
Diet
Exercise, physical activity
Diabetes
Pre-existing heart disease, or already having had a heart attack There are some imaging tests that may be used in cardiac risk assessment. Non-invasive tests may include, for example, an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) or a stress test, also called ECG stress test or metabolic stress test. Invasive tests may also be used to evaluate for the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but they are usually used for diagnostic purposes in people with signs and symptoms and not for risk assessment. Examples include an angiography/arteriography and cardiac catheterization. (For more on these, see the Mayo Clinic webpage on Coronary artery disease: Diagnosis.)
The lipid panel is the most important blood test for cardiac risk assessment."

An assessment requires interpretation by a trained medical professional. However, there are resources available to help you better understand your risk. For example, you can read the American Heart Association article Understand Your Risks to Prevent a Heart Attack. Using results of the lipid panel and a physical exam, you can calculate your 10-year risk of heart disease or stroke using the Heart Risk calculator from AHA and American College of Cardiology if you are age 40 to 75 and do not have heart disease. And there are home tests available to measure your cholesterol. (For more on home cholesterol testing, see the Mayo Clinic article Are home cholesterol test kits accurate"

Chymotrypsinogen, the inactive precursor of chymotrypsin, is produced in the pancreas and transported to the small intestine. In the small intestine, it is activated to form chymotrypsin. It is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down the protein in food into smaller pieces, called peptides. Chymotrypsin is detectable in the stool if the pancreas is functioning normally.
Individuals with pancreatic dysfunction may either have blocked pancreatic ducts or the cells that produce chymotrypsinogen may be damaged or destroyed. Such cell damage and duct blockage cause pancreatic insufficiency because the amount of enzymes transported to the small intestine is inadequate for proper food digestion. This is often seen in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and sometimes pancreatic cancer."

A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. Glucose tolerance tests help diagnose gestational diabetes, which is high blood glucose that develops during pregnancy.
Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes and their babies can receive appropriate treatment during pregnancy as well as after delivery. If untreated, mothers with gestational diabetes can pass more glucose to their developing babies than they need, and their fetuses may gain a lot of weight. These mothers may give birth to large babies (weighing 9 pounds or more), which can cause complications for the mothers and their babies, such as difficult labor and delivery, heavy bleeding after delivery, or need for a cesarean delivery. Women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have other conditions, such as high blood pressure. There is an increased risk of preeclampsia for women with gestational diabetes.
Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may experience more trauma during delivery due to their size. They may have other complications, such as breathing problems, jaundice, and may be born with low glucose levels. These babies also have an increased risk of being stillborn.
Both women who have had gestational diabetes and their babies have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life.
Several health organizations recommend that all pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes using blood tests.
In the U.S., laboratory testing may involve either a one-step or two-step approach: One-step 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): after a fasting glucose level is measured, a woman is given a 75-gram dose of glucose to drink and her glucose levels are measured at 1 hour and 2 hours after the dose. Only one of the values (including the fasting glucose level) needs to be above a cutoff value for diagnosis of diabetes to be made.
Two-step:
Perform a glucose challenge test as a screen: a woman is given a 50-gram glucose dose to drink and her blood glucose level is measured after 1 hour.
If the challenge test is abnormal, perform a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. After a woman's fasting glucose level is measured, she is given a 100-gram glucose dose and her glucose is measured at timed intervals. If at least 2 of the glucose levels at fasting, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours are above a certain level, then a diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made.  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference currently recommend the two-step approach, while the Endocrine Society recommends the one-step approach, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) says either the one-step or two-step approach is appropriate."

Epinephrine and norepinephrine belong to a group of similar hormones called catecholamines. This test measures the amount of VMA that is passed into the urine, typically over a 24-hour period, to detect excess epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is used to detect tumors called neuroblastomas and other neuroendocrine tumors.
Catecholamines are produced in the central portion of the adrenal glands, the adrenal medulla. Adrenal glands are small triangular organs located on top of each kidney. The primary catecholamines released are dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These hormones are released into the bloodstream in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and metabolism.
After completing their actions, the catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Dopamine becomes homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine breaks down into normetanephrine and VMA, and epinephrine becomes metanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine. VMA is usually present in the urine in small fluctuating amounts that only increase appreciably during and shortly after the body is exposed to a stressor.
Sometimes, tumors begin to form in the cells of the neuroendocrine system, which is made up of a combination of cells that produce hormones and nerve cells. These types of cells are found throughout the body in organs such as the lungs and the digestive system. Tumors that form in these cells are called neuroendocrine tumors.
Neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas, can sometimes produce large amounts of catecholamines, resulting in greatly increased concentrations of the hormones and their metabolites. The hormone releases can cause illness and signs and symptoms, such as persistent hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the extremities.
Neuroblastomas are rare cancers, but they are the most common cancers affecting infants, according to the American Cancer Society. About 700 new cases are diagnosed each year, primarily in babies one to two years old, with up to 90% of cases occurring in children under the age of five. Rarely, a baby may be born with a neuroblastoma. Arising from primitive nerve cells, these cancers can be found in the abdomen, adrenal glands, neck, chest, or pelvis. About two-thirds of the time, the tumors will have spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body by the time they are diagnosed.
Once detected, many neuroblastomas can be successfully treated. In some cases, neuroblastomas may disappear without treatment. In other cases, their cells may spontaneously mature into normal nerves cells, turning the neuroblastoma into a benign ganglioneuroma or into a partially benign ganglioneuroblastoma.
Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that arise primarily in the adrenal glands. According to the National Cancer Institute, they affect 2 to 8 people per million per year, primarily those in their thirties to fifties. Most pheochromocytomas are benign and do not spread from their original location, but some may metastasize and move to other organs within the body. Left untreated, they continue to grow and produce catecholamines, and hormone-related symptoms continue to worsen.
Over time, hypertension caused by the pheochromocytoma may damage body organs, such as the kidneys and heart, and raise the risk of an affected person having a stroke or heart attack. Pheochromocytomas are important to diagnose because they represent a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, they can be removed and/or treated to reduce or eliminate the associated symptoms and complications.
The VMA test, along with other tests for catecholamines and their metabolites, can be used to help detect the presence of neuroblastomas. The preferred tests for pheochromocytomas are plasma free metanephrines, urine metanephrines, and urine or plasma catecholamine tests. However, the VMA test may still be ordered along with one or more of these tests to help detect and rule out a pheochromocytoma."

The role of AMH and the amount normally present varies depending upon sex and age. This test measures AMH in the blood.
Very early in the development of a baby boy, AMH is produced by the testicles, inhibiting the development of female reproductive organs while promoting the development of other male reproductive organs. In boys, the level of AMH remains high until puberty, when it begins to taper off.
In girls, low levels of AMH are produced, thus allowing the development of female reproductive structures. The AMH level in young girls remains low until puberty, when the ovaries begin to produce it and levels increase. AMH will then steadily decline in women over their reproductive years, becoming very low and eventually undetectable after menopause.
AMH is important for a woman during her childbearing years. At birth, a female has about one million eggs (oocytes), which then decrease naturally in number during childhood to about 500,000. Only a tiny number of these remaining eggs will go through follicle maturation – one at a time as part of a woman's monthly menstrual cycle. AMH has a balancing effect on the monthly cyclical actions of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) during the process of egg maturation and release (ovulation). The amount of AMH present is a reflection of this follicular growth.
Studies have shown that the AMH level may be useful in determining a woman's remaining egg maturation potential (ovarian reserve) and her likelihood of conceiving. AMH declines over time during childbearing years, drops significantly as menopause approaches, and typically becomes almost undetectable after menopause. Determining the AMH level may be useful in evaluating a woman's current fertility status and may predict the onset of menopause.
Elevated AMH levels have been associated with a condition affecting the ovaries known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The excess follicles that occur in this syndrome produce abnormally large amounts of AMH.
AMH also plays a vital part in sexual differentiation in the fetus. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, a developing baby has the potential to develop either male or female reproductive organs. Production of AMH and androgens by the two testicles that are present in a baby boy inhibits development of female reproductive organs (the Müllerian ducts found in both male and female fetuses) and promotes the formation of other male reproductive organs. If a sufficient amount of AMH is not available or absent during this process, then both male and basic female organs may develop. A baby born with ambiguous genitalia may not be instantly recognized as either male or female.
AMH may be elevated in some ovarian tumors (benign or cancerous). If a tumor produces the hormone, then the AMH test can be used as a tumor marker to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to monitor for recurrence."

This test measures the amount of ketones in the blood.
Ketones are produced when glucose is not available to the body's cells as an energy source and/or when the body cannot use glucose as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin. Fat is used as fuel instead. When fat is metabolized, byproducts called ketone bodies build up in the blood, causing first ketosis and then progressing to ketoacidosis, a form of metabolic acidosis. This condition is most frequently seen with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and can be a medical emergency.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is associated with sudden and severe high blood glucose (acute hyperglycemia), a severe insulin deficiency, and a disruption of the body's acid-base balance. Excess ketones and glucose are dumped into the urine by the kidneys in an effort to flush them from the body. This causes increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and a loss of electrolytes. Symptoms may also include rapid breathing, shortness of breath, a fruity scent to the breath, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, confusion, and eventually coma.
Ketosis and ketoacidosis may also be seen with prolonged starvation, alcoholism, and with high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets (keto diets). It may be induced on purpose in some children with epilepsy who have frequent seizures and do not respond to available medications or other treatments.
There are three ketone bodies – acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. Acetoacetate is created first when fat is metabolized.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate is created from acetoacetate. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body present in severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Acetone is a spontaneously created side product of acetoacetate. Different ketone tests measure one or more ketone bodies, and their results are not interchangeable.
Blood testing gives a snapshot of the status of ketone accumulation at the time that the sample was collected. Urine ketone testing reflects recent rather than current blood ketones. Urine testing is much more common than blood ketones testing. It may be performed by itself, with a urine glucose test, or as part of a urinalysis. The urine methods measure either acetoacetate or acetoacetate and acetone but do not usually detect beta-hydroxybutyrate.
Blood ketones may be measured in a laboratory or with a handheld monitor. The laboratory test uses serum, the liquid portion of the blood, and typically measures acetoacetate. Beta-hydroxybutyrate can be ordered as a separate blood test.
When whole blood from a fingerstick is tested for ketones using a handheld monitor, the monitor measures beta-hydroxybutyrate. This test may be performed at the bedside in a hospital or emergency room, in a healthcare practitioner's office, or performed at home."

This test measures the amount of tryptase in the blood.
Mast cells are large tissue cells found throughout the body. They are present in highest amounts in the skin, the lining of the intestine and air passages, and the bone marrow. They contain granules that store a number of chemicals, including tryptase and histamine. When mast cells are activated, they release their contents. If a person has too many mast cells (mastocytosis) and/or the cells are activated inappropriately, the chemicals that are released (especially histamine) may cause symptoms that range from moderate to life-threatening.
Normally, the level of tryptase in the blood is very low. When mast cells are activated, the level increases rapidly, rising within 15 to 30 minutes, peaking at 1 to 2 hours, and returning to normal after several hours to a couple of days. In people with severe allergies, activation of many mast cells can cause an extreme form of allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause low blood pressure, hives (blisters on the skin), severe narrowing of the air passages, and even death. Tryptase levels will be very high in people with anaphylaxis.
In some cases, tryptase levels will be high in persons with mast cell activation disorders, in which mast cells become activated without apparent allergies or other reasons.
Tryptase levels can also be significantly and persistently increased with mastocytosis, a rare group of disorders associated with an abnormal increase in the number of mast cells. These cells may accumulate in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or in organs throughout the body (systemic mastocytosis).
While cutaneous mastocytosis typically only causes skin problems (particularly hives), people with systemic mastocytosis or a mast cell activation disorder may experience anaphylaxis and its associated symptoms. These symptoms may be persistent and are related to the organs affected by mast cell accumulation. Systemic mastocytosis may progress slowly or may be aggressive, causing organ dysfunction and, in rare cases, causing a form of leukemia."

EPO plays a key role in the production of red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. This test measures the amount of erythropoietin in the blood.
The body uses a dynamic feedback system to help maintain sufficient oxygen levels and a relatively stable number of RBCs in the blood. Erythropoietin is produced and released into the blood by the kidneys in response to low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia). The amount of erythropoietin released depends on how low the oxygen level is and the ability of the kidneys to produce erythropoietin.
EPO is carried to the bone marrow, where it stimulates production of red blood cells. The hormone is active for a short period of time and then eliminated from the body in the urine.
As oxygen levels in the blood rise to normal or near normal levels, the kidneys slow production of EPO. However, if your kidneys are damaged and do not produce enough erythropoietin, then too few RBCs are produced and you can becomes anemic. Similarly, if your bone marrow is unable to respond to the stimulation from EPO, then you may become anemic. This can occur with some bone marrow disorders or with chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. (Read Anemia of Chronic Diseases to learn more.)
If you have a condition that affects the amount of oxygen you breathe in, such as a lung disease, you may produce more EPO to try to compensate for the low oxygen level. People who live at high altitudes may also have higher levels of EPO and so do chronic tobacco smokers.
If you produce too much erythropoietin, which can happen with some benign or malignant kidney tumors and with a variety of other cancers, you may produce too many RBCs (polycythemia or erythrocytosis). This can lead to an increase in the blood's thickness (viscosity) and sometimes to high blood pressure (hypertension), blood clots (thrombosis), heart attack, or stroke. Rarely, polycythemia is caused by a bone marrow disorder called polycythemia vera, not by increased erythropoietin."

The virus exists as two main types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV testing identifies the presence of the virus in a sample from a blister, sore or fluid to diagnose an active herpes infection or testing detects antibodies in the blood to determine previous exposure to herpes.
Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are contagious and periodically cause small fever blisters (vesicles) that break to form open lesions. HSV-1 primarily causes blisters or ""cold sores"" around the mouth (non-genital sites).
HSV-2 usually causes lesions around the genital area. However, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can affect either the oral or genital areas.
The herpes simplex virus can be passed from person-to-person through skin contact while the sores are open and healing and sometimes when there are no visible sores. HSV-2 is the type most often spread during sex, but HSV-1 may also infect the genital area during oral sex.
Most people who have HSV-2 are unaware they are infected because signs and symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed. When symptoms do appear, they may begin as painful blisters at the site of infection, usually within two weeks after infection.
The blisters can appear around the mouth, in the vaginal area, on the penis, around the anus, or on the buttocks or thighs.
The blisters generally heal within two to four weeks.
This primary episode can include a second outbreak of blisters and even flu-like symptoms such as fever and swollen glands.
However, not everyone develops blisters and sometimes symptoms are so mild that they are unnoticeable or mistaken for something else, such as insect bites or a rash. Once you are infected and the initial infection resolves, the virus remains in your body in a latent form for the rest of your life. During periods of stress or illness, the virus may reactivate and you may have periodic outbreaks. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have had an organ transplant, may have more frequent and serious outbreaks of HSV.
There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications such as acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir can suppress outbreaks and shorten the duration of symptoms and active shedding of the virus.
Rarely, the virus can cause infections in newborns (neonatal herpes) when a mother transmits the virus to her baby during a vaginal delivery. Neonatal herpes symptoms appear during the first month of life. If left untreated, herpes can cause long-term health problems in the baby and can be life-threatening. A pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with herpes may be monitored regularly prior to delivery to detect a reactivation of her infection.
A HSV infection can spread to the brain, causing encephalitis. This illness can be fatal or cause serious, permanent neurological problems in those who survive.
Herpes may be tested a few different ways:
Direct detection of the virus
The preferred methods of testing for the virus in people with active blisters or sores are the herpes culture and HSV PCR testing. PCR testing is the preferred method if encephalitis or neonatal herpes are suspected. HSV DNA PCR (NAAT)—this method detects HSV genetic material in a sample from the blister, blood, or other fluid, such as spinal fluid. PCR can detect the virus as well as identify the type of herpes virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2). This method is more sensitive than culture and is becoming more widely available.
Herpes culture—a sample of fluid is collected from an open sore using a swab and cultured. If the culture is positive, the virus can be further identified as HSV-1 or HSV-2. Antibody testing
HSV antibody (serologic) testing detects immune proteins called immunoglobulin G (IgG) in your blood that the body produces in response to a herpes infection. HSV antibody testing can detect both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies as well as differentiate between them."

They are important for body growth, development, and health. They form the structural part of most organs and make up enzymes and hormones that regulate body functions. This test measures the amount of protein in your blood.
Two classes of proteins are found in the blood, albumin and globulin. Albumin is made by the liver and makes up about 60% of the total protein. Albumin keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, nourishes tissues, and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, and substances like calcium throughout the body.
Globulins make up the remaining 40% of proteins in the blood. The globulins are a varied group of proteins, some produced by the liver and some by the immune system. They help fight infection and transport nutrients. The test also compares the amount of albumin with globulin and calculates what is called the A/G ratio. A change in this ratio can provide your healthcare practitioner with a clue as to the cause of the change in protein levels.
Total protein levels in the blood may increase or decrease, to a greater or lesser degree, with various conditions.
Total protein levels may decrease in conditions that: Interfere with production of albumin or globulin proteins, such as malnutrition or severe liver disease
Increase the breakdown or loss of protein, such as kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome)
Increase or expand the volume of plasma, the liquid part of blood (diluting the blood), such as congestive heart failure Total protein levels may increase with conditions that cause: Abnormally high production of protein (e.g., inflammatory disorders, multiple myeloma)

These bacteria are highly contagious and are passed from person to person through coughing and sneezing and close contact. Whooping cough tests are performed to detect and diagnose infection with B. pertussis.
The time between infection with the bacteria and developing signs and symptoms (incubation period) varies from a few days to up to three weeks. B. pertussis typically causes a prolonged, three-stage infection: Catarrhal Stage: This is the first stage of the disease, which usually lasts about one to two weeks. Symptoms may resemble a mild cold, with runny nose, low-grade fever and an occasional cough. Infants may develop apnea (a pause in breathing) during this stage and may be more prone to choking. Individuals are highly contagious during this time.
Paroxysmal Stage: This is the second stage of infection, which may last for one to two weeks or persist for a couple of months, and is characterized by severe bouts of coughing. Coughing is frequently followed by a 'whoop' sound and patients may feel exhausted and/or vomit after these coughing fits.
Convalescent Stage: During the third stage, the frequency and severity of the coughing starts to lessen and decreases over the next two to three weeks. Whooping cough can sometimes lead to complications requiring hospitalization, particularly for infants, and may include apnea (61%) or pneumonia (23%), or much less frequently convulsions (1%), brain disease or damage (encephalopathy) (about 0.3%) or death (1%).
Whooping cough used to be very common in the United States, affecting about 200,000 people during outbreaks that would occur every few years. Since the introduction of a whooping cough vaccine and widespread vaccination of infants, this number has drastically decreased. For details on the whooping cough vaccine, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Pertussis: Summary of Vaccine Recommendations.
Importantly, prior infection or receipt of the complete vaccination series for whooping cough do not prevent you from becoming infected as they do not provide lifetime immunity or protection from re-infection. Fully vaccinated individuals who are infected with B. pertussis may develop a less severe infection, with persistent coughing but without the classic paroxysmal cough.
Periodic outbreaks of whooping cough in unvaccinated infants, in adolescents, and in adults still occur in the United States. According to the CDC, 10,000 to 40,000 cases of whooping cough are reported each year. Over 48,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in 2012, the most recent peak year, and many more likely went unreported.
Diagnostic tests for whooping cough
Because the initial symptoms of whooping cough, especially during the catarrhal stage, are frequently indistinguishable from those of a common cold or of other respiratory illnesses, such as bronchitis, influenza (flu), or in children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), diagnostic testing is necessary to help identify the infection.
There are a few test methods that may be used to detect whooping cough, and the type of testing your healthcare practitioner orders is largely dependent on how long you have had symptoms. Bacterial culture – if the B. pertussis bacteria are present in your sample, this test will grow them on an agar plate. It may take up to 7 days for the bacteria to grow; however, the bacteria may be less likely to grow if you have been treated with certain antibiotics before the sample was collected. Culture testing is most useful in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset. If necessary, bacteria that grow in culture may be used for susceptibility testing to identify the optimal antibiotic to use.

To conduct the test, genetic material is isolated from your test sample and then is copied many times. That genetic material can be analyzed for traces of SARS-CoV-2, and, because of the copying process, even small amounts can be detected.
Nucleic acids are the genetic material that is analyzed, and the copying process is known as amplification. For that reason, nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is the technical name for this kind of molecular testing.
There are various types of laboratory methods to conduct this type of testing. RT-PCR has been commonly used in COVID-19 testing. Examples of other methods that may be used in NAAT include loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), transcription mediated amplification (TMA), nicking endonuclease amplification reaction (NEAR), strand displacement amplification (SDA), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and helicase-dependent amplification (HDA).
These types of laboratory techniques are not used exclusively for COVID-19. They can also be used to detect other kinds of viruses, and tests are available that can analyze the same test sample for SARS-CoV-2 as well as different strains of flu."

A molecular test can also be used for screening. If you have no symptoms, you may get a molecular test if: You have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.
You have been in situations at high risk of viral transmission, such as travel or large gatherings of people.
You live or work in an environment like a correctional facility, nursing home, or homeless shelter where there is an elevated risk of viral spread or severe cases of COVID-19.
You are going to have a medical procedure like a surgery or a procedure that generates tiny air particles known as aerosols.
You are going to start taking a medication that affects your immune system.
You are required to provide a negative test result by your employer, in order to travel, or to take part in another activity. Because there are many different applications of molecular COVID-19 tests, your doctor can best explain whether this kind of testing is appropriate in your situation.

Results are normally available within a few days after your sample is received by the lab.
At-home self-tests: These tests also involve taking your own test sample, but that sample is then analyzed at home using a device that is included in your test kit. These tests often provide results within 30 minutes. With either type of at-home test, it is essential to follow the test kit’s instructions for properly collecting your sample and avoiding potential sources of contamination.
While at-home tests are generally accurate, they are not considered to be as reliable as standard laboratory testing. Rapid tests are more susceptible to an inaccurate result than tests processed in a lab.

When prescribed by a doctor, most of these costs are covered by insurance, but you may be charged a copay or deductible. In some cases, government programs are covering the full costs of COVID-19 testing.
At-home tests that are not prescribed by a doctor are not usually covered by insurance. At-home test options are often available for less than $150 per test.

A negative test result is usually accurate, but occasional false negative results have been reported in which the virus is not detected in a sample from a person who is infected.
Although these tests are typically very dependable, various factors can influence the accuracy of molecular testing. The part of the body where the sample is taken, proper specimen collection and handling, and the method of laboratory analysis may affect the test result.

This test detects genetic variation in the gene CYP2C19. A healthcare practitioner may sometimes order this test to determine whether clopidogrel will be effective for you or if another drug for treatment may be required.
Clopidogrel is a drug that is part of a group of medications called antiplatelet drugs and is used to prevent strokes and heart attacks in people who are at increased risk for these serious cardiovascular events. The drug works by helping to prevent harmful blood clots from forming by preventing platelets from clumping together (aggregating).
Normally, when an injury occurs to blood vessels, platelets in the blood stick to the site of injury and clump together to start the formation of a blood clot and help stop the bleeding. In people at increased risk for heart attack or stroke, this process can occur inappropriately, so they may be treated with drugs that prevent platelet aggregation.
Clopidogrel is given in an inactive form (i.e., prodrug) and must be changed (metabolized) by the body to an active form before it can be effective. Some people who have some genetic variations in the gene CYP2C19 do not metabolize clopidogrel to its active form as well as people who do not have these genetic variations in CYP2C19. Therefore, individuals with CYP2C19 genetic variations who are taking clopidogrel may not receive adequate benefit from the drug and may be at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. This test identifies people who have one or more CYP2C19 variants.
You inherit one copy of each of your genes from your mother and one copy from your father. Thus, the CYP2C19 gene is present in the body as two inherited gene copies (alleles). You could have both copies of a gene without any variants (wild-type, normal); one copy without variants and one copy with a variant (heterozygous); both copies with the same variant (homozygous); or both copies with different variants (compound heterozygous). The combination of the CYP2C19 gene copies that you have can determine how effectively clopidogrel is changed to its active form in your body and its overall effect.
Clopidogrel responsiveness (or clopidogrel genotype) testing determines whether CYP2C19 gene variants are present. Careful interpretation of the results can help the healthcare provider decide the appropriate antiplatelet treatment for you."

It helps transport nutrients into cells and removes waste products out of cells. It is also important in muscle function, helping to transmit messages between nerves and muscles. This test measures the amount of potassium in the blood and/or urine.
Electrolytes are minerals that carry a charge and exist in your body fluids. Potassium and other electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate (total CO2) help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintains a stable acid-base balance. Potassium is present in all body fluids, but most potassium is found within the cells. Only a small amount is present in fluids outside the cells and in the liquid part of the blood (called serum or plasma).
We get most of the potassium we need from the foods that we eat. Most people will have an adequate intake of potassium. The body uses what potassium it requires, then the kidneys eliminate the rest in the urine. The body tries to keep the blood potassium level within a very narrow range. Levels are mainly controlled by aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands above the kidneys.
Because the blood concentration of potassium is so small, minor changes can have significant health effects. Potassium levels that are too low or too high can alter the function of the nerves and muscles and there can be serious health complications, such as shock, breathing problems (respiratory failure), irregular heart beat, or the heart muscle may even lose its ability to contract.
Measuring potassium as part of an electrolyte or metabolic panel may help diagnose an electrolyte imbalance or acidosis or alkalosis. Acidosis and alkalosis describe the abnormal conditions that result from an imbalance in the pH of the blood caused by an excess of acid or alkali (base). This imbalance is typically caused by some underlying condition or disease."

The exact function of calreticulin protein remains largely unknown, but it is likely involved in ensuring the correct folding of new proteins, maintaining correct calcium levels in cells, and a number of other cell functions. Mutations of the CALR gene are associated with bone marrow neoplasms that cause the production of too many blood cells. These blood disorders are collectively known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The CALR mutation test looks for abnormalities in the CALR gene to help diagnose and classify MPNs.
The MPNs most commonly associated with CALR mutations are: Essential thrombocythemia (ET)—there are too many platelet-producing cells (megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia—there are too many platelet-producing cells and cells that produce scar tissue in the bone marrow CALR mutations are the second most common genetic abnormality (after JAK2 mutations) associated with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis. They are present in about 20-25% of adults with ET and 25-30% of adults with PMF. Although rare and not well understood in children, 50% of pediatric PMF patients had CALR mutations.
The CALR mutation is acquired after birth as opposed to inherited. It is caused by the addition or removal of small amounts of genetic material to a region of the gene called exon 9. This leads to an abnormal calreticulin protein. It is not yet understood how the mutant protein leads to signs and symptoms of MPN. While more than 50 types of CALR mutation have been found, only the two most common variants associated with MPNs are included in conventional PCR testing. Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis should detect all mutation variants but is not widely available.
In addition to helping diagnose MPNs, CALR mutation testing can provide information about a person's prognosis. Studies have shown that compared to individuals with the JAK2 mutation, those with the CALR mutation had a milder disease course, fewer signs and symptoms of blood clotting (thrombotic episodes), and better survival."

This process produces ammonia, which is then converted into the less toxic waste product urea. This test measures the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in the blood. Sometimes, a BUN to creatinine ratio is calculated to help determine the cause of elevated levels.
Nitrogen is a component of both ammonia and urea. Urea and urea nitrogen are referred to somewhat interchangeably because urea contains nitrogen and because urea/urea nitrogen is the ""transport method"" used by the body to rid itself of excess nitrogen. Urea is formed in and released by the liver into the blood and is carried to the kidneys, where it is filtered out of the blood and released into the urine. Since this is an ongoing process, there is usually a small but stable amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. However, when the kidneys cannot filter wastes out of the blood due to disease or damage, then the level of urea in the blood will rise.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that are located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back. Within them are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a microscopic cluster of looping blood vessels, called glomerulus. The glomerulus allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells and larger molecules. Attached to each glomerulus is a tiny tube (tubule) that collects the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus and then reabsorbs what still can be used by the body. The remaining waste forms urine.
Most diseases or conditions that affect the kidneys or liver have the potential to affect the amount of urea present in the blood. If increased amounts of urea are produced by the liver or if the kidneys are not working properly and have difficulty filtering wastes out of the blood, then urea levels will rise in the blood. If significant liver damage or disease inhibits the production of urea, then BUN levels may fall."

Unlike most cancers, the cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and some other leukemias can be traced to a single, specific genetic abnormality in one chromosome. The presence of the gene sequence known as BCR-ABL1 confirms the diagnosis of CML and a form of acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL), specifically a type of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. In very rare cases, the abnormal chromosome is linked to cases of acute myeloid leukemia and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes containing inherited genetic information. Those genes contain the blueprints, in the form of DNA, for producing the proteins that our bodies rely on to function properly. While some genetic abnormalities are inherited, they can also come from changes that occur to genes or chromosomes after a person is born. This can happen through exposure to various environmental factors (e.g., radiation, certain chemicals) but more often for unknown reasons.
The BCR-ABL1 gene sequence is one such acquired change that is formed when pieces of chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 break off and switch places. When this occurs, the ABL1 region in chromosome 9 fuses with the BCR gene region in chromosome 22. This type of change is called a reciprocal translocation and is often abbreviated as t(9;22). The resulting chromosome 22 that has the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome because that is where it was first discovered.
The resulting Philadelphia chromosome contains an abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that encodes an abnormal protein that is responsible for the development of CML and a type of ALL. At diagnosis, 90-95% of cases of CML show a characteristic t(9;22) BCR-ABL1 reciprocal chromosomal translocation. About 30% of adults with B-ALL have the translocation, while it is only present in about 2 to 4% of cases in children.
The protein coded for by the abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a type of enzyme called a tyrosine kinase. That enzyme is responsible for the uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells. When large numbers of abnormal leukemic cells start to crowd out the normal blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, signs and symptoms of leukemia start to emerge. Treatment of these leukemias typically involves a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Testing for BCR-ABL1 detects the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or its transcripts, which are the RNA copies made by the cell from the abnormal stretches of DNA. The presence of the BCR-ABL1 abnormality confirms the clinical diagnosis of CML, a type of ALL, and rarely acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
There are several different types of BCR-ABL1 tests available, including: Cytogenetics (chromosome analysis or karyotyping)
This test looks at chromosomes under a microscope to detect structural and/or numerical abnormalities. For example, the Philadelphia chromosome is a small abnormal version of chromosome 22 resulting from the exchange or translocation of material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22. Cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are grown in the laboratory and then examined to determine if the Philadelphia chromosome is present. Other chromosomal abnormalities can also be detected.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
This test method uses fluorescent dye-labeled probes to ""light up"" the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence when it is present. Test results for FISH are often available more quickly than for conventional chromosome analysis.
Genetic molecular testing (qualitative or quantitative)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative and quantitative tests detect and measure the BCR-ABL1 RNA transcripts in leukemia cells taken from blood or bone marrow samples. This test can detect very small amounts of BCR-ABL, even when the Philadelphia chromosome isn’t seen in bone marrow cells by less sensitive but important techniques like chromosome analysis or FISH.
Secondary mutations within BCR-ABL1 are known to cause resistance to therapy. These can be detected by DNA sequencing methods."

Although the test is no longer commonly performed in the United States or other developed countries, it is still in use in many emerging nations where enteric fever is endemic and limited resources require the use of rapid, affordable testing alternatives. While the method is easy to perform, concerns remain about the reliability of the Widal test. It is not specific for typhoid fever and can be positive when a person does not have the infection.
Enteric fever is a life-threatening illness caused by infection with the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. typhi), usually transmitted through food and drinks contaminated with fecal matter. It is associated with symptoms that include high fever, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, weight loss, and a rash known as ""rose spots."" Early diagnosis and treatment are important because serious complications, including severe intestinal bleeding or perforation, can develop within a few weeks.
The infection is rare in the U.S. and other industrialized nations but is more common in developing countries, including India, parts of South, East and Southeast Asia, and countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe. Cases of enteric fever in the U.S. are usually attributed to travelers to these endemic areas.
In the U.S. and other developed nations, testing for enteric fever usually involves a blood culture to detect the bacteria during the first week of fever. A stool, urine or bone marrow culture may also be performed. A blood culture, however, can be labor- and time-intensive in areas of the world that lack the resources for automated equipment. In developing countries, such as those in Africa, the Widal test continues to be used instead of cultures because it is quicker, simpler, and less costly to perform.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that due to the various factors that can influence the results of a Widal test, it is best not to rely too much on this test. WHO instead recommends the use of cultures, whenever possible. Until another simple, inexpensive, and reliable option becomes available, however, use of the Widal test will probably persist in those countries with limited resources.

Changes in SHBG levels can affect the amount of hormone that is available to be used by the body's tissues. This test measures the level of SHBG in the blood and is most often used to help evaluate patients for testosterone deficiency or excess.
In men, about 45% to 65% of testosterone in blood is normally bound to SHBG, with the remainder weakly and reversibly bound to albumin (the main protein in the blood). Only about 2% to 3% of testosterone is immediately available to the tissues as free testosterone, but testosterone that is weakly bound to albumin is also bioavailable and can be readily taken up by the body's tissues.
Slightly more testosterone is bound to SHBG in the blood (66% to 78%) in women than in men. In women, SHBG plays an integral role in regulating the levels of bioavailable male sex hormones (androgens) and estrogens circulating throughout the body. SHBG has a higher affinity for the androgens testosterone and DHT and so in the setting of low SHBG, women may have signs and symptoms related to androgen excess.
A total testosterone test does not distinguish between bound and unbound testosterone but determines the overall level of testosterone in the plasma. In many cases, this test is sufficient to evaluate patients for excess or deficient testosterone production. However, if your SHBG level is not normal, then the total testosterone may not be an accurate representation of the amount of testosterone that is available to your tissues. An SHBG test may be performed when your signs and symptoms do not correlate with the results of a total testosterone test."

The tests detect and/or measure several substances in the urine, such as byproducts of normal and abnormal metabolism, cells, cellular fragments, and bacteria.
Urine is produced by the kidneys, two fist-sized organs located on either side of the spine at the bottom of the ribcage. The kidneys filter wastes out of the blood, help regulate the amount of water in the body, and conserve proteins, electrolytes, and other compounds that the body can reuse. Anything that is not needed is eliminated in the urine, traveling from the kidneys through ureters to the bladder and then through the urethra and out of the body. Urine is generally yellow and relatively clear, but each time a person urinates, the color, quantity, concentration, and content of the urine will be slightly different because of varying constituents.
Many disorders may be detected in their early stages by identifying substances that are not normally present in the urine and/or by measuring abnormal levels of certain substances. Some examples include glucose, protein, bilirubin, red blood cells, white blood cells, crystals, and bacteria. They may be present because: There is an elevated level of the substance in the blood and the body responds by trying to eliminate the excess in the urine.
Kidney disease is present.
There is a urinary tract infection present, as in the case of bacteria and white blood cells. A complete urinalysis consists of three distinct testing phases: Visual examination, which evaluates the urine's color and clarity
Chemical examination, which tests chemically for about 9 substances that provide valuable information about health and disease and determines the concentration of the urine
Microscopic examination, which identifies and counts the type of cells, casts, crystals, and other components such as bacteria and mucus that can be present in urine See below for details on each of these examinations.
A microscopic examination is typically performed when there is an abnormal finding on the visual or chemical examination, or if a healthcare practitioner specifically orders it.
Abnormal findings on a urinalysis may prompt repeat testing to see if the results are still abnormal and/or may be followed by additional urine and blood tests to help establish a diagnosis."

Urine for a urinalysis can be collected at any time. In some cases, a first morning sample may be requested because it is more concentrated and more likely to detect abnormalities.
Sometimes, you may be asked to collect a ""clean-catch"" urine sample. For this, it is important to clean the genital area before collecting the urine. Bacteria and cells from the surrounding skin can contaminate the sample and interfere with the interpretation of test results. With women, menstrual blood and vaginal secretions can also be a source of contamination. Women should spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back; men should wipe the tip of the penis. Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, then collect one to two ounces of urine in the container provided, then void the rest into the toilet.
A urine sample will only be useful for a urinalysis if taken to the healthcare provider's office or laboratory for processing within a short period of time.

Susceptibility testing is performed on bacteria or fungi causing an individual's infection after they have been recovered in a culture of the specimen. Testing is used to determine the potential effectiveness of specific antibiotics on the bacteria and/or to determine if the bacteria have developed resistance to certain antibiotics. The results of this test can be used to help select the drug(s) that will likely be most effective in treating an infection.
Bacteria and fungi have the potential to develop resistance to antibiotics and antifungal drugs at any time. This means that antibiotics once used to kill or inhibit their growth may no longer be effective. (For more about cultures, see specific articles: Blood Culture, Urine Culture, Wound Culture, AFB Smear and Culture, Fungal Tests).
Although viruses are microbes, testing for their resistance to antiviral drugs is performed less frequently and by different test methods. This article is limited to the discussion of bacterial and fungal susceptibility testing.
During the culture process, pathogens are isolated (separated out from any other microbes present). Each pathogen, if present, is identified using biochemical, enzymatic, or molecular tests. Once the pathogens have been identified, it is possible to determine whether susceptibility testing is required. Susceptibility testing is not performed on every pathogen; there are some that respond to established standard treatments. For example, strep throat, an infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A streptococcus), can be treated with ampicillin and does not require a test to predict susceptibility to this class of antibiotics.
Susceptibility testing is performed on each type of bacteria or fungi that may be relevant to the individual's treatment and whose susceptibility to treatment may not be known. Each pathogen is tested individually to determine the ability of antimicrobials to inhibit its growth. This is can be measured directly by bringing the pathogen and the antibiotic together in a growing environment, such as nutrient media in a test tube or agar plate, to observe the effect of the antibiotic on the growth of the bacteria. Resistance can also be determined by detection of a gene that is known to cause resistance to specific antibiotics."

These drugs are used to suppress the immune system and are prescribed to treat various immune-related conditions or blood disorders (e.g., leukemia). The activity level of the TPMT enzyme, or the genetics underlying the enzyme's activity, is tested before thiopurine drug therapy to make sure that individuals treated with the drugs can metabolize them.
Examples of thiopurines include azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine. These medications are used to treat diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders. They may also be prescribed for organ transplant recipients to help delay or prevent organ rejection. If someone's TPMT activity is too low, the person may not effectively metabolize thiopurines, which can lead to severe side effects.
About one person in every 300 is severely deficient in TPMT, and about 10% of the population in the U.S. has lower than normal levels of TPMT. Individuals in both categories are at an increased risk for thiopurine drug toxicity, which can affect the activity of the bone marrow (myelosuppression) and lead to very reduced levels of blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (hematopoetic toxicity). This can lead to complications such as anemia, serious infections, and/or excessive bleeding.
These side effects can cause an individual to become severely ill and may even be life-threatening. These side effects can be avoided if TPMT testing is done before starting thiopurine treatment.
There are two ways to determine whether an individual is at risk of side effects from thiopurine therapy: TPMT activity test (phenotype)—this method tests the activity level of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in a person's red blood cells. Depending on the enzyme activity level, a person may be prescribed a standard dose of the thiopurine drug, a reduced dose of the thiopurine drug, or a different drug other than a thiopurine.
TPMT genetic test (genotype)—an alternative test to TPMT enzyme activity level is a genetic test that can identify genetic variations in the TPMT gene. This genetic test identifies individual genetic differences associated with risk for thiopurine toxicity. Each person has two copies of the TPMT gene. Most people have two copies of ""wild type"" TPMT that produce sufficient TPMT enzyme. Approximately 10% of people have one copy of the wild-type gene and one copy of a gene variation associated with decreased TPMT (heterozygous) and intermediate enzyme activity. Approximately one in 300 individuals have two copies of TPMT with variations resulting in little or no enzyme activity (homozygous). While numerous variations can occur in TPMT, there are five variations in particular that have been proven to be associated with TPMT deficiencies. Most genetic tests look for these five variations, although depending on the method used, more variations can be detected.
This genetic test provides information about a person's likely response to thiopurines, but it will not measure how much TPMT enzyme is actually being made by the body. There can be significant person-to-person and ethnic variability in TPMT production, even in people with the same gene variations.
A third, different kind of test may be used after thiopurine treatment begins. A test that measures thiopurine breakdown products (thiopurine metabolites) may be used to monitor therapy and adjust doses. For more on this, see Common Questions below."

The CBC can evaluate your overall health and detect a variety of diseases and conditions, such as infections, anemia and leukemia.
Blood cells are produced and mature primarily in the bone marrow and, under normal circumstances, are released into the bloodstream as needed. The three types of cells evaluated by the CBC include:
Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream when they mature. They contain hemoglobin, a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus, the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect the production of new RBCs and/or their lifespan, in addition to those conditions that may result in significant bleeding.
RBCs normally are uniform in size and shape, but their appearance can be affected by a variety of conditions, such as vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies and iron deficiency. An example of a common condition affecting RBCs is anemia, which results from low red blood cell counts and low hemoglobin. Various diseases can lead to anemia, so additional tests are often needed to determine the cause. For more details, see the articles on Red Blood Cell Count, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit.
White Blood Cells
White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are cells that exist in the blood, the lymphatic system, and tissues and are an important part of the body's natural defense (immune) system. They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, and allergic reactions. There are five different types of WBCs and each has a different function. They include neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes.
WBCs are present in the blood at relatively stable numbers. However, these numbers may temporarily shift higher or lower depending on what is going on in the body. For instance, an infection can stimulate your bone marrow to produce a higher number of neutrophils to fight off a bacterial infection. With allergies, there may be an increased number of eosinophils. An increased number of lymphocytes may be produced with a viral infection. In certain diseases, such as leukemia, abnormal (immature or mature) white cells may rapidly multiply. For additional details, see the articles White Blood Cell Count and WBC Differential.
Platelets
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are actually tiny cell fragments that circulate in blood and are essential for normal blood clotting. When there is an injury and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding by adhering to the injury site and clumping together to form a temporary plug. They also release chemical signals that attract and promote clumping of additional platelets and eventually become part of a stable blood clot at the site of the injury that remains in place until the injury heals.
If you have a disease or condition that causes low platelets (thrombocytopenia) or dysfunction of platelets, you may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. An excess of platelets (thrombocytosis) can cause excessive clotting. For more information, see the article Platelet Count."

A standard CBC includes:
Red blood cell (RBC) tests: Red blood cell (RBC) count is a count of the actual number of red blood cells in your blood sample.
Hemoglobin measures the total amount of the oxygen-carrying protein in the blood, which generally reflects the number of red blood cells in the blood.
Hematocrit measures the percentage of your total blood volume that consists of red blood cells.
Red blood cell indices provide information on the physical features of the RBCs:
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the average size of your red blood cells.
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) is a calculated measurement of the average amount of hemoglobin inside your red blood cells.
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is a calculated measurement of the average concentration of hemoglobin inside your red blood cells.
Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in the size of your red blood cells.
The CBC may also include reticulocyte count, which is a measurement of the absolute count or percentage of newly released young red blood cells in your blood sample. White blood cell (WBC) tests: White blood cell (WBC) count is a count of the total number of white blood cells in your blood sample.
White blood cell differential may be included as part of the CBC or may be done in follow up if the WBC count is high or low. The WBC differential identifies and counts the number of the five types of white blood cells present (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils). The individual count can be reported as an absolute count and/or as a percentage of total. Platelet tests: The platelet count is the number of platelets in your blood sample.
Mean platelet volume (MPV) may be reported with a CBC. It is a measurement of the average size of platelets.
Platelet distribution width (PDW) may also be reported with a CBC. It reflects how uniform platelets are in size. CBC results that are outside the established reference intervals may indicate the presence of one or more diseases or conditions. Typically, other tests are performed to help determine the cause of abnormal results. Often, a blood smear will be examined using a microscope. A trained laboratory professional will evaluate the appearance and physical features of the blood cells, such as size, shape and color, noting any abnormalities that may be present. This information gives the healthcare practitioner additional clues as to the cause of abnormal CBC results."

These cells are normally only present in the bone marrow because they are precursors of neutrophils, the predominant type of white cells in blood.

Copper is an essential mineral that plays a role in the regulation of iron metabolism, formation of connective tissue, energy production within cells, and the function of the nervous system. It is absorbed from food and liquids by the intestines and then transported to the liver, where it is stored or used to produce a variety of enzymes.
The liver binds copper to a protein to produce ceruloplasmin and then releases it into the bloodstream. About 95% of the copper in the blood is bound to ceruloplasmin. Because of this, the ceruloplasmin test can be used along with one or more copper tests to help diagnose Wilson disease, an inherited disorder that can lead to excess storage of copper in the eyes, liver, brain, and other organs."

These genetic changes and small amounts of blood may be the first and sometimes the only signs of precancerous growths (polyps) or early colon cancer, making this stool-based test a useful screening tool. Detecting precancerous polyps and/or colon cancer early increases the chances that they can be successfully treated.
By combining two types of tests, the stool DNA test increases the chance of detecting polyps and colon cancer. The stool DNA tests for: DNA changes (mutations) associated with colon cancer—cancer is caused by changes in the DNA inside our cells. These changes can cause cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. The stool DNA test detects changes associated with colon cancer in the DNA of cells that are shed from the digestive tract into stool.
Trace amounts of blood (hidden or ""occult"" blood)—although there are several possible causes of blood in the stool, one important cause is the presence of polyps or cancer in the digestive tract. Colon polyps are common as people age, but most polyps do not cause any health problems and are benign. However, a benign polyp can turn into a cancerous polyp and the cancer may even spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Polyps are finger-like growths that protrude into the cavity (lumen) of the colon or the rectum. They can be fragile and bleed intermittently, such as when food waste brushes against them, leading to blood in the stool. This test uses a method called fecal immunochemical testing to detect trace amounts of blood (occult blood) in the stool. The fecal immunochemical test detects the globin (protein) part of hemoglobin in red blood cells. The test is specifically designed to detect globin from human blood and not from foods that you eat (e.g., meat). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not necessary before testing. Also, hemoglobin from bleeding in the upper digestive tract is broken down before it reaches the lower digestive tract and so upper GI bleeds are not usually detected by this test."

It is inhaled or ingested and subsequently absorbed into the blood. This testing detects and/or measures nicotine and its primary breakdown product (metabolite) cotinine in the blood, urine, saliva, or hair.
Nicotine is metabolized by the liver into more than 20 compounds, which are eliminated from the body in the urine. Both tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke can increase nicotine and cotinine concentrations in the body. Levels also rise with use of nicotine replacement products such as nicotine patches and gums, and with the use of smokeless nicotine vapor (e-cigarettes). In large amounts, nicotine can be poisonous.
Long-term smoking of tobacco products can increase the risk of developing many diseases, including lung cancer, oral cancer, COPD, stroke, heart disease, and respiratory infections. Years of smokeless tobacco use also increases the risk of developing oral cancer (cheeks, gums, and lips). Long-term tobacco use can worsen asthma and help promote blood clot formation. In pregnant women, smoking can impair growth of the developing baby and lead to low birth weight babies.
Cotinine is usually the test of choice to evaluate tobacco use or exposure to tobacco smoke because it is stable and is only produced when nicotine is metabolized. Cotinine has a half-life in the body of between 7 and 40 hours, while nicotine has a half-life of 1 to 4 hours.
Blood and/or urine cotinine tests may be ordered along with nicotine tests. In some cases, other nicotine metabolites, such as nicotine-1'-N-oxide, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, or nornicotine, or other tobacco chemicals, such as anabasine in urine, may also be tested. The presence of anabasine in someone's urine indicates that the person is actively using a tobacco product, as it is not found in commercial nicotine replacement products, such as a patch.
The presence of nicotine and/or cotinine in an individual's sample may indicate the use of tobacco or nicotine products or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Testing may be used in a number of situations to evaluate the possible use of tobacco products, such as in smoking cessation programs, prospective employment assessments, and evaluations of applicants for health or life insurance.
Nicotine and cotinine testing may also be ordered in cases of suspected nicotine poisoning. Acute overdoses of nicotine, such as might happen if a child ingests nicotine lozenges or gum, are relatively rare but generally require immediate medical attention."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/apo-b,Apo B,['Apolipoprotein B-100'],['Apolipoprotein B'],"February 6, 2019.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Apolipoprotein B-100 (also called apolipoprotein B or apo B) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of lipids and is the main protein constituent of lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the ""bad cholesterol""). This test measures the amount of apo B in the blood.
Apolipoproteins combine with lipids to transport them throughout the bloodstream. Apolipoproteins provide structural integrity to lipoproteins and shield the water-repellent (hydrophobic) lipids at their center. Most lipoproteins are cholesterol- or triglyceride-rich and carry lipids through the body for uptake by cells.
Chylomicrons are the lipoprotein particles that carry dietary lipids from the digestive tract, via the bloodstream, to tissue – mainly the liver. In the liver, the body repackages these dietary lipids and combines them with apo B-100 to form triglyceride-rich VLDL. This combination is like a taxi full of passengers with apo B-100 as the taxi driver. In the bloodstream, the taxi moves from place to place, releasing one passenger at a time.
An enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL) removes triglycerides from VLDL to produce intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) first and then LDL. Each VLDL particle contains one molecule of apo B-100, which is retained as VLDL loses triglycerides and shrinks to become the more cholesterol-rich LDL. Apo B-100 is recognized by receptors found on the surface of many of the body's cells. These receptors promote the uptake of cholesterol into the cells.
The cholesterol that LDL and apo B-100 transport is vital for cell membrane integrity, sex hormone production, and steroid production. In excess, however, LDL can lead to fatty deposits (plaques) in artery walls and lead to hardening and scarring of the blood vessels. These fatty depositions narrow the vessels in a process termed  atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic process increases the risk of heart attack.
Apo B-100 levels tend to mirror LDL-C levels, a test routinely ordered as part of a lipid profile. Many experts think that apo B levels may eventually prove to be a better indicator of risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than LDL-C. Some recommend the measurement of apo B to help with risk prediction when a person has multiple risk factors. Other experts disagree; they feel that apo B is only a marginally better alternative and do not recommend its routine use. The clinical utility of apo B and that of other emerging cardiac risk markers such as apo A-I, Lp(a), and hs-CRP has yet to be fully established."

It evaluates both the liquid portion, called semen or seminal fluid, and the microscopic, moving cells called sperm. It is often used in the evaluation of male infertility. A shorter version of this test checks solely for the presence of sperm in semen a few months after a man has had a vasectomy to determine whether the surgery was successful.
Semen is a viscous, whitish liquid that contains sperm and the products from several glands. It is fairly thick at ejaculation but thins out, or liquefies, within 10 to 30 minutes. Sperm are reproductive cells in semen that have a head, midsection, and a tail and contain one copy of each chromosome (all of the male's genes). Sperm are motile, normally moving forward through the semen. Inside a woman's body, this property enables them to travel to and fuse with the female's egg, resulting in fertilization. Each semen sample is between 1.5 and 5.5 milliliters (about one teaspoon) of fluid, containing at least 20 million sperm per milliliter, and varying amounts of fructose (a sugar), buffers, coagulating substances, lubricants, and enzymes that are intended to support the sperm and the fertilization process.
A typical semen analysis measures: Volume of semen
Viscosity—consistency or thickness of the semen
Sperm count—total number of sperm
Sperm concentration (density)—number of sperm per volume of semen
Sperm motility—percent able to move as well as how vigorously and straight the sperm move
Number or percent of normal and abnormal (defective) sperm in terms of size and shape (morphology)
Coagulation and liquefaction—how quickly the semen turns from thick consistency to liquid
Fructose—a sugar in semen that gives energy to sperm
pH—measures acidity
Number of immature sperm
Number of white blood cells (cells that indicate infection) Additional tests may be performed if the sperm count is low, if the sperm show decreased motility or abnormal morphology, or if the seminal fluid is found to be abnormal. These additional tests may help identify abnormalities such as the presence of sperm antibodies, abnormal hormone levels (testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin), excessive number of white blood cells, and genetic tests for conditions that may affect fertility, such as Klinefelter syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or other chromosomal abnormality.
In some instances, imaging tests such as ultrasound, CAT scan, or MRI may be required. A biopsy of the testicle may also be needed. Sometimes a test called cryosurvival is done to see how well semen will survive for long-term storage if a couple would like to store sperm for future pregnancies."

Infertility evaluation: Most laboratories require samples to be collected on-site as the semen needs to be examined within 60 minutes after ejaculation in order to maintain the quality of the specimen.
Semen is collected in a private area by self-stimulation. Some men, for religious or other reasons, might want to collect semen during the act of intercourse, using a condom. If this is the case, the healthcare practitioner should provide the condom or sheath because lubricated condoms can affect test results.
Sperm are very temperature-sensitive. If collection is done at home, the sample should be kept at body temperature (98.6oF/37oC) by keeping it next to the body during transportation. It should not be left at room temperature for an extended period of time and should not be refrigerated.
Sperm motility decreases after ejaculation; thus, timing and temperature are critical to obtaining accurate results. If the sample is poor, repeat testing might be needed."

Follow any instructions that are provided.
Post-vasectomy: Men may be advised to have regular ejaculations every 3-4 days to clear sperm from the reproductive tract more quickly."

Symptoms can affect the skin where the bite occurred or elsewhere on the skin and may progress to affect other parts of the body. A family of bacteria, known as Borrelia, causes Lyme disease."
https://labtestsonline.org/lyme-disease-testing,Lyme Disease Tests,[],[],"May 21, 2021.","June 21, 2021.",Who should get testing?,"Testing is usually indicated if a person has symptoms of Lyme disease and a known or possible exposure to ticks that can carry the Borrelia bacteria. However, because it takes time for antibodies to develop, the timing of testing is important to consider.
Lyme disease symptoms depend on the extent of the bacterial infection. Three phases are used to describe the infection:  Early localized: In this initial phase, symptoms are normally found only near the tick bite. This early stage is called erythema migrans and involves a noticeable rash that typically develops within a few weeks after being bitten.
Early disseminated: In this phase, the bacteria move through the blood to affect other parts of the body and can cause general symptoms like fever, headaches, and pain. In some cases, the bacteria can affect the heart or nervous system.
Late disease: This phase occurs long after the initial tick bite and most often includes symptoms affecting the joints or nervous system.  It is important to understand these phases because testing is not equally valuable in each stage. With early localized disease and erythema migrans, blood testing is generally not helpful because antibodies have not had enough time to develop.
In people with symptoms of early disseminated or late disease, testing can help determine whether they have had a previous Borrelia infection. Blood testing alone, though, does not diagnose Lyme disease. It is one factor to be considered alongside symptoms and potential tick exposure.
Some symptoms of Lyme disease, like joint pain, can be caused by many other health conditions. For this reason, testing is not recommended if you only have these kinds of nonspecific symptoms and no other indications of Borrelia exposure. In these cases, a positive test can be misleading because antibodies could be the result of a past infection rather than an active condition causing your present symptoms.
Because of similar concerns about potential false positive results, random screening for Lyme disease in people without symptoms is not recommended even in areas that are known to have ticks that can carry the Borrelia bacteria.
Testing of the cerebrospinal fluid is most often indicated when a person has neurological symptoms consistent with Lyme disease and positive or inconclusive blood tests.
Getting test results
For a blood test or lumbar puncture, you will likely receive test results from your doctor. Your doctor may call you with results or schedule you for a follow-up office visit. Results may also be sent to you through an online health portal or in the mail.
For at-home blood tests that are sent to a lab, you usually get results a few business days after your sample is received. Results are often provided through a smartphone app or website.
Lyme disease tests are generally effective for determining whether someone has been exposed to Borrelia, but, like any medical test, they are not perfect. There are considerations that can affect the accuracy of tests and how they are interpreted.  Cross-reactivity: It is possible for antibodies to other bacteria to be detected by tests for antibodies to Borrelia. This is known as a false positive because the test shows Borrelia exposure when none actually occurred. A misleading positive result can also occur in patients who have previously had Lyme disease or who have received a vaccine for Lyme disease.
Standardization of interpretation: The CDC has issued guidelines for how to interpret antibody test results. Studies have found that laboratories that follow these guidelines produce more consistent and reliable analyses than laboratories that apply non-standard criteria.
Test timing: When the test is taken is important to consider because of the time it can take for different antibodies to develop and be detectable in the blood.  The laboratory and doctor can take these factors into account when interpreting your test results. Overall, testing is typically reliable in assessing bacteria exposure, but it is important to remember that this is distinct from a definitive diagnosis of Lyme disease."

This test measures the level of MMA in blood or sometimes urine.
Vitamin B12 is responsible for two critical enzymatic reactions that promote cell metabolism. B12 promotes the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA (a form of MMA) to succinyl Coenzyme A, and with folic acid, aids in converting homocysteine to methionne.
Blood and/or urine levels of MMA rise when your B12 level begins to decrease. The measurement of elevated amounts of methylmalonic acid in the blood or urine serves as a sensitive and early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency.
A B12 deficiency can occur when your nutrition intake is poor or you have gastrointestinal malabsorption issues. Over time, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause blood cell changes, leading to anemia and the production of large red blood cells (macrocytes). It can also cause signs and symptoms of neuropathy, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet and/or, in advanced cases, mental or behavioral changes such as cognitive impairment, confusion, irritability, and depression. An increased concentration of MMA is often detectable even before B12 levels abnormally decrease, presence of blood cell changes, and/or before full-blown symptoms are apparent, though some people may have some degree of neuropathy.
The relationship between MMA and B12 has been known for over 40 years, but the use of MMA testing is not widespread nor is there agreement on its usefulness. Because a relatively large amount of the B12 found in the blood is bound to proteins and is not biologically active, some in the medical community think that MMA may be a better measure of bioavailable B12 than the usual vitamin B12 test. Others believe that MMA and homocysteine (which may also be elevated when either B12 or folate is deficient) are valuable in detecting early and mild cases of B12 deficiency. Still others argue that many of the mild deficiencies detected do not progress to more severe deficiencies and do not necessarily need to be identified or treated."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/heavy-metals,Heavy Metals,['Toxic Metals'],['Heavy Metals Panel'],"April 17, 2020.","March 24, 2021.",What is being tested?,"A heavy metals panel is a group of tests that detects and measures specific potentially toxic metals in the blood, urine or, more rarely, in the hair or other body tissue or fluid. A laboratory may offer several different heavy metals panels as well as individual tests for metals. The most common combination includes: Lead
Mercury
Arsenic Other panels may include one or more additional metals, such as cadmium, copper, or zinc. A healthcare practitioner will select which metals to test based on what you may have been exposed to and your signs and symptoms.
The term ""heavy metals"" is loosely defined. It is related to the periodic table of elements and refers to a variety of elements with high density or metallic properties. These elements are found naturally throughout the environment and are also used by industries to manufacture a wide range of common products. Some of them, such as iron, copper, selenium, molybdenum, and zinc, are required in trace amounts by the body for normal function but can be toxic at higher levels.
Heavy Metals Poisoning
Significant concentrations of any of the heavy metals can be irritating or damaging to the body and can contaminate soil, air, food, and water, persisting indefinitely in the environment. Because they are a source of potential injury, the term ""heavy metals"" is frequently used interchangeably with the term ""toxic metals.""
The signs and symptoms that you may experience depend upon the type of metal, its form, the quantity, the length of exposure, the type of exposure, your age, and your general state of health. Some metals are much more toxic than others, and one form of a metal may be more harmful than other forms, such as an organic versus an inorganic metal compound. How you are exposed can influence the amount of metal absorbed and the part(s) of the body that are affected. For example, a metal that does little when it is held in your hand, or is only moderately harmful and poorly absorbed when swallowed, may be much more toxic and cause severe lung damage when its vapors are inhaled.
Severe acute exposure can cause damage and, in some cases, can be life-threatening, but moderate exposures over time should also be monitored. The body is able to process small amounts of heavy metals, but moderate to large quantities can accumulate in the kidneys, liver, bones and brain. Some metals are considered carcinogenic – they increase the risk of developing cancer – and some can affect the body's ability to produce red and white blood cells. Fetuses and young children are at the highest risk because exposures to low or moderate concentrations can affect physical and mental development and can permanently damage the organs and brain. Many of the metals can be passed from the mother to the fetus, and some can be passed to the infant in breast milk."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/heavy-metals,Heavy Metals,['Toxic Metals'],['Heavy Metals Panel'],"April 17, 2020.","March 24, 2021.",How is the sample collected for testing?,"Heavy metal testing is usually performed on a blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm or on a 24-hour urine collection. Special metal-free blood or acid-washed urine containers are used to collect the sample to lower the risk of sample contamination by any outside sources of metal.
Urine and blood can both be used for heavy metal testing, but they do not necessarily test for the same forms of a metal. For instance, methylmercury – an organic highly toxic form of mercury found in fish – can be detected in the blood but not in urine. Urine is the preferred sample for measuring inorganic forms of mercury and for measuring arsenic. For lead, blood more accurately correlates with adverse health effects than other fluids or tissues.
Hair and fingernail analysis can give an indication of exposure that has occurred over time or in the past but does not show recent exposures. Independently, they are not to be used to determine exposure. Blood and urine will reflect exposures that are long-term (chronic) or that have happened in the last few days.
In rare cases, a biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for testing."

It is a negatively charged ion that works with other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, to help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. This test measures the level of chloride in the blood and/or urine.
Chloride is present in all body fluids but is found in the highest concentration in the blood and in the fluid outside of the body's cells. Most of the time, chloride concentrations mirror those of sodium, increasing and decreasing for the same reasons and in direct relationship to sodium. When there is an acid-base imbalance, however, blood chloride levels can change independently of sodium levels as chloride acts as a buffer. It helps to maintain electrical neutrality at the cellular level by moving into or out of the cells as needed.
We get chloride in our diet through food and table salt, which is made up of sodium and chloride ions. Most of the chloride is absorbed by the digestive tract, and the excess is eliminated in urine. The normal blood level remains steady, with a slight drop after meals (because the stomach produces acid after eating, using chloride from blood)."

This test measures the amount of apo A-I in the blood.
Lipids alone cannot dissolve in the blood; they are like oil that floats on water. Apolipoproteins are the proteins that combine with lipids to make lipoprotein particles that can transport lipids throughout the bloodstream. Apolipoproteins provide structural integrity to lipoproteins and shield the water-repellent (hydrophobic) lipids at their center.
Most lipoproteins are cholesterol- or triglyceride-rich (two main lipids) and carry them throughout the body for uptake by cells. HDL, however, is like an empty taxi. It goes out to the tissues and picks up excess cholesterol, then transports it back to the liver. In the liver, the cholesterol is either recycled for future use or excreted in bile. HDL's reverse transport is the only way that cells can get rid of excess cholesterol. This reverse transport helps protect the arteries and, if there is enough HDL present, it can even reverse the build-up of fatty plaques, deposits resulting from atherosclerosis that can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Apolipoprotein A is the taxi driver. It activates the enzymes that load cholesterol from the tissues into HDL and allows HDL to be recognized and bound by receptors in the liver at the end of the transport. There are two forms of apolipoprotein A: apo A-I and apo A-II. Apo A-I is found in greater proportion than apo A-II (about 3 to 1). The concentration of apo A-I can be measured directly and tends to rise and fall with HDL levels. Deficiencies in apo A-I correlate with an increased risk of developing CVD. Apo A-I levels provide more information to help evaluate CVD risk, especially when HDL levels are low."

It measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in a sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. The PTT assesses the amount and the function of certain proteins in the blood called coagulation or clotting factors that are an important part of blood clot formation.
When body tissue(s) or blood vessel walls are injured, bleeding occurs and a process called hemostasis begins. Small cell fragments called platelets stick to and then clump (aggregate) at the injury site. At the same time, a process called the coagulation cascade begins and coagulation factors are activated in a step-by-step process. Through the cascading reactions, threads called fibrin form and crosslink into a net that clings to the injury site and stabilizes it. This forms a stable blood clot to seal off injuries to blood vessels, prevents additional blood loss, and gives the damaged areas time to heal.
Each part of this hemostatic process must function properly and be present in sufficient quantity for normal blood clot formation. If the amount of one or more factors is too low, or if the factors cannot do their job properly, then a stable clot may not form and bleeding continues.
With a PTT, your result is compared to a normal reference interval for clotting time. When your PTT takes longer than normal to clot, the PTT is considered ""prolonged.""
When a PTT is used to investigate bleeding or clotting episodes or to rule out a bleeding or clotting disease (e.g., preoperative evaluation), it is often ordered along with a prothrombin time (PT). A healthcare practitioner will evaluate the results of both tests to help rule out or determine the cause of bleeding or clotting disorder.
It is now understood that coagulation tests such as the PT and PTT are based on what happens artificially in the test setting (in vitro) and thus do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, they can be used to evaluate certain components of the hemostasis system. The PTT and PT tests each evaluate coagulation factors that are part of different groups of chemical reaction pathways in the cascade, called the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways. The PTT is used to evaluate the coagulation factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK).
A PT test evaluates the coagulation factors VII, X, V, II, and I (fibrinogen). For more on this, see the article on the Coagulation Cascade."

This test detects two of the most common mutations.
When there are mutations or variations in the MTHFR gene, it can lead to serious genetic disorders such as homocystinuria, anencephaly, spina bifida, and others. The MTHFR enzyme is critical for metabolizing one form of B vitamin, folate, into another. It is also part of the process that converts homocysteine into methionine, an important building block for many proteins.
If someone has increased levels of homocysteine, that means the body is not processing it properly. One cause of that could be a mutation in the MTHFR gene, causing homocystinuria. While at least seven unique MTHFR mutations have been found in people with homocystnuria, there are two relatively common DNA sequence variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that are tested. The two MTHFR variants are called C677T and A1298C, and individuals can inherit one or both variants. These SNPs result in changes in the DNA (or mutations) that are associated with decreased MTHFR activity and increased homocysteine levels in the blood, which may increase the risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), formation of inappropriate blood clots (thrombosis), and stroke.
Approximately 5-14% of the U.S. population is homozygous for C677T, meaning that they have two copies of it. There is some ethnic variability in the frequency, with the highest being in those of Mediterranean ancestry and the lowest in those of African ancestry.
The C677T variant results in a less active form of the MTHFR enzyme and reduced ability to process folate and homocysteine. When a person has two copies of the MTHFR C677T gene mutation (homozygous) or one copy of MTHFR C677T and one copy of A1298C (compound heterozygous), decreased MTHFR enzyme activity slows down the homocysteine-to-methionine conversion process and can lead to a buildup of homocysteine in the blood.
The increase in homocysteine is often mild to moderate but will vary from person to person depending upon the amount of MTHFR enzyme activity. Even if a person has two copies of the MTHFR mutation, that person may not develop high homocysteine levels since adequate folate intake can ""cancel out"" the effect of the MTHFR mutation.
Results of some studies suggest that high levels of homocysteine in the blood may contribute to risk of CVD by damaging blood vessel walls and promoting formation of plaque (atherosclerosis) and inappropriate blood clots. However, a direct link between homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease or thrombotic risk has not been found. For more on this, see the article on Homocysteine."

The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right-hand part of the abdomen and behind the lower ribs. It takes up most of the space under the ribs and some space in the left upper abdomen as well.
The liver is responsible for several essential body functions, such as: Filtering and breaking down harmful substances from the blood to be removed from the body in urine and stools
Making bile that helps digest food, especially fat
Storing glycogen, which is used for energy
Converting nutrients from the food we eat into essential blood components
Regulating blood clotting
Maintaining hormone balances
Storing some vitamins
Making factors that help the immune system fight infection
Removing bacteria from the blood In addition, liver cells convert ammonia (end product of amino acids) to a less harmful substance called urea, which the body can get rid of through the urine.
A variety of diseases and infections can cause acute or chronic damage to the liver, causing inflammation (hepatitis), scarring (cirrhosis), bile duct obstructions, liver tumors, and liver dysfunction. Alcohol, drugs, some herbal supplements, and toxins can also inure the liver. A significant amount of liver damage may occur before symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, itching (pruritus), nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and unexplained weight loss or gain appear. Early detection of liver injury is essential in order to minimize damage and preserve liver function.
The liver panel typically consists of several tests that measure the following:
Liver enzymes: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) – an enzyme mainly found in the liver; the best test for detecting hepatitis
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) – an enzyme related to the bile ducts but also produced by the bones, intestines, and during pregnancy by the placenta (afterbirth); often increased when bile ducts are blocked or damaged
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) – an enzyme found in the liver and a few other organs, particularly the heart and other muscles in the body Proteins: Albumin – measures the main protein made by the liver; the level can be affected by liver and kidney function and by decreased production or increased loss.
Total protein (TP) – measures albumin and all other proteins in blood, including antibodies made to help fight off infections
Bilirubin – two different tests of bilirubin often used together (especially if a person has jaundice): total bilirubin measures all the bilirubin in the blood; direct bilirubin measures a form that is conjugated (combined with another compound) in the liver. Depending on your healthcare provider and the laboratory performing the testing, additional tests may be included in a liver panel. Examples include: Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) – another enzyme found mainly in liver cells; it is a very sensitive marker for liver diseases, but it is not specific as it cannot differentiate between various causes of liver diseases. GGT is not recommended for routine use. It is used in conjunction with ALP to determine the source of increased ALP, either from bone or liver. High level of GGT can be found with alcohol consumption.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) – an enzyme released with cell damage; found in cells throughout the body
Prothrombin time (PT) – the liver produces proteins involved in the clotting (coagulation) of blood; the PT measures clotting function and, if abnormal, may indicate liver damage.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) – associated with regeneration or proliferation of liver cell and can be produced by certain types of tumors
Autoimmune antibodies (e.g., ANA, SMA, anti-LKM-1) – associated with autoimmune liver diseases (autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC))"

Platelet function tests indirectly evaluate how well a person's platelets work in helping to stop bleeding within the body.
Platelets are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood. When there is an injury to a blood vessel and bleeding begins, platelets are the first elements to help to stop bleeding. They do so in three ways. They: Adhere to the injury site
Clump together (aggregate) with other platelets, forming a temporary plug
Release compounds that stimulate further aggregation and the eventual formation of a blood clot These reactions result in the formation of a loose platelet plug in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This is called secondary hemostasis and the two processes result in the formation of a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed.
If there are insufficient platelets or if they are not functioning normally in any of the three main ways, a stable clot may not form and a person may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding. The number of platelets in blood can be determined with a platelet count and can help diagnose disorders having to do with too many or too few platelets. However, the overall ability of platelets to function properly in the body is more difficult to measure.
Platelet function tests are a group of assays that use specialized equipment to measure the ability of platelets to aggregate and promote clotting in a sample of blood. There are a variety of tests available but no one test that identifies all problems with platelet function. Also, there is no widespread agreement on which test(s) is best for each circumstance.
In addition to evaluating people for excessive bleeding, platelet function tests may be used in other situations. There are situations in which it is desirable to decrease the ability of platelets to aggregate, as in for people who are at an increased risk of developing a dangerous blood clot or at increased risk for heart attacks. These people may be prescribed medications that reduce platelet activation or reduce their ability to aggregate. People on these types of anti-platelet medications, such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel, may have platelet function tests done as a way of monitoring their treatment. However, there is currently no consensus among medical experts on the usefulness of platelet function tests in anti-platelet therapy.
Screening Tests
Bleeding time
In the past, the primary screen for platelet dysfunction was the bleeding time or the standardized bleeding time. This was the only test that directly measured platelet function within the body. It involves making two small, shallow, standardized cuts on the inner forearm and measuring the amount of time for bleeding to stop. The bleeding time procedure has fallen from favor in recent years. Many hospitals no longer offer it and several national organizations have issued position statements against its routine use. The bleeding time is not sensitive or specific and it does not necessarily reflect the risk or severity of surgical bleeding. It is poorly reproducible, can be affected by aspirin use and by the skill of the person performing the test, and frequently leaves small, thin scars on the forearm.
Closure time assays
This test measures the time required for the platelets in a sample of blood to plug a small hole in a tiny tube after being exposed to various activating substances. This is called the closure time. Prolonged closure times indicate lower platelet function but do not identify the cause. This test may be abnormal if the platelet count is low, if platelet function is reduced, if other proteins needed for platelet function are reduced, or if anti-platelet medications are present. This type of assay can be used to screen for von Willebrand disease and some platelet function disorders, but it will not detect all platelet function disorders, particularly the milder forms. This test is relatively simple to perform and is available in many healthcare facilities. Further testing would need to be performed in order to identify the exact cause of any abnormal results.
Viscoelastometry (or Thromboelastometry)
Blood clots have to be strong to stop bleeding and prevent new bleeding until healing can occur. This type of testing is designed to determine the strength of a blood clot as it forms. It is most often performed in larger hospitals, either in the operating room as a point-of-care test or in the clinical laboratory.
Endpoint bead or endpoint platelet aggregation assays
These assays determine the number of coated beads or platelets that aggregate after substances are added to activate platelets in a sample of blood. They provide a single measure of aggregation (an endpoint) rather than a measure of aggregation over time. More platelets aggregating or sticking to beads indicates better platelet function. These tests may be abnormal if the platelet count is low, if platelet function is reduced, or if anti-platelet medications are present.
Platelet count ratio
The number of platelets are measured in an initial sample. A substance is added to the sample to activate the platelets and cause them to aggregate. The number of platelets is measured again – only those that have not aggregated will be counted the second time. The difference between the first measurement and the second measurement is an indication of platelet function.
Diagnostic Tests
Platelet aggregometry
Many different substances can activate a platelet, including proteins in the wound, factors released from other activated platelets, and factors produced by the coagulation system that aids platelets in forming a strong plug to stop bleeding. Many different platelet abnormalities have been described due to problems with one or more of these activating systems. Platelet aggregometry consists of 4 to 8 separate tests. In each test, a different platelet activating substance (agonist) is added to blood, followed by measurement of platelet aggregation over several minutes. When complete, the entire panel of tests is reviewed and interpreted to determine if there is any evidence of abnormal platelet function. Platelet aggregation testing is the gold standard in platelet function testing and can diagnose a variety of inherited and acquired platelet function disorders. It is typically performed at academic medical centers or large hospitals due to the complexity of the testing and interpretation.
Lumiaggregometry
Similar to platelet aggregometry, lumiaggregometry simultaneously measures the release of certain organic agents from platelet granules (little sacs within the platelet) utilizing a luminescence technique. This technique measures the amount of light emitted when activating substances are added, that results in the conversion of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This measurement reflects any abnormalities that may be present in platelet granules, a problem with patients with 'storage pool defects' that are often seen in grey platelet syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
Flow cytometry
Platelets can be evaluated for functional defects using flow cytometry. This test uses lasers to determine proteins that are present on the platelet surface and how they change when the platelet is activated. Platelet flow cytometry is a highly specialized procedure available only in a few university hospital and reference laboratories to diagnose inherited platelet function disorders."

This test measures the amount of pregnenolone in the blood in order to help detect rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
CAH is a group of inherited disorders associated with deficiencies in the enzymes required for the production of the steroid hormones. CAH may be due to: 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common cause of CAH (about 90% of cases)
11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (about 5-8% of cases)
3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiencies, two rare forms of the disease
Lipoid CAH, also very rare, is most often due to a defect in the StAR gene, which codes for the Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which, in turn, regulates the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. For normal steroid hormone production, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone in the adrenal glands and then several enzymes complete the production of multiple hormones, including: Cortisol, which helps metabolize proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, maintain blood pressure, and regulate the immune system
Aldosterone, which maintains normal sodium and potassium levels in the blood and helps control blood volume and pressure
Sex steroid hormones – including androgens, the ""male hormones"" such as testosterone, and ""female"" hormones including estrogen and progesterone, which are responsible for the development and maintenance of male and female secondary sexual characteristics Because a low level of cortisol causes the level of a pituitary hormone that stimulates adrenal growth and hormone production (adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH) to become elevated, the adrenal gland increases in size. However, the increased size and activity cannot overcome the block in cortisol production. Other substances (such as pregnenolone) that do not need the defective enzyme will be produced in excess.
With CAH, the enzyme deficiency can cause a decrease in cortisol and/or aldosterone and, in some cases, an increase or decrease in androgens. Deficient androgens can cause male newborns to be born with external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) and can affect the development of secondary sexual characteristics of both males and females at puberty.
Pregnenolone, several of the intermediate precursors, and one or more of the steroid hormones can be measured by laboratory tests to determine which step is deficient or defective, based upon which products have been produced and how much and which precursors are in excess.
If both 21- and 11-hydroxylase deficiencies have been ruled out (the most common forms of CAH), then analysis of pregnenolone, along with tests for other precursors, may be used to help establish a diagnosis of 3-beta-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase or 17-alpha-hydroxylase or StAR deficiency."

Serotonin is a chemical derived from the amino acid tryptophan. It is produced as needed by the nervous system, mainly the brain, but also by special cells in the bronchial tubes (lungs) and gastrointestinal tract. More than 90% of serotonin in the blood is found in the platelets.
Serotonin helps transmit nerve impulses and constrict blood vessels, is a participant in the wake-sleep cycle, and affects mood. Serotonin is metabolized by the liver and its metabolites, primarily 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), are eliminated in the urine.
Normally, serotonin is present in small amounts in the blood. Large quantities of serotonin and 5-HIAA may be produced continuously or intermittently by some carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing masses that can form in the gastrointestinal tract (especially in the appendix) and in the lungs, although they may affect other organs as well. They are one of several types of tumors that arise from cells in the neuroendocrine system. These cells, which secrete hormones in response to signals from the nervous system, are found in organs throughout the body. The serotonin produced by carcinoid tumors may cause flushing of the face, diarrhea, a rapid heart rate, and wheezing, especially when the tumor has spread to the liver. This group of signs and symptoms is referred to as the carcinoid syndrome.
According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 gastrointestinal and between 2,000 and 4,500 lung carcinoid tumors diagnosed each year in the United States. Many more of these tumors may exist, but most remain small and do not cause any symptoms. When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/mercury,Mercury,['Hg (chemical symbol)'],"['Mercury, Urine and Blood']","January 30, 2019.","December 6, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Mercury is an element that can be toxic in various forms, which are tested in different samples: Metallic or elemental mercury is a liquid often used in dental fillings, some thermometers, and batteries. Urine samples are typically tested to detect this form of mercury.
Inorganic mercury salts, which are produced by the reaction of non-carbon based compounds with mercury, are normally in a form of powder or crystal and sometimes used in topical preparations such as skin-lightening or antiseptic creams. Urine samples are usually used to detect this form of mercury.
Methyl mercury and other organic mercury compounds are products of reactions between mercury and carbon-based organic compounds. Bacteria with elevated levels of methyl mercury are often found in large, older, predator fish such as sharks and king mackerel. People who eat these fish may be exposed to this form of mercury. Blood is primarily used to identify a high level of methyl mercury. Mercury is found in small quantities throughout the environment. It is released by the breakdown of minerals in rocks and soils and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and waste incineration. It is inhaled with the air that we breathe, absorbed through the skin, and ingested with food. Mercury is also used in some mirror coatings, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural chemicals. Energy efficient compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs contain small amounts of mercury, which is also used to make electrical equipment, wire, and switching devices.
The tiny amounts to which the vast majority of people are exposed do not generally cause health concerns. However, people may develop mercury-related symptoms or complications if they are exposed to dangerous concentrations of mercury, such as might be found at a hazardous waste site, or are exposed to mercury over long periods of time, especially if they work with heavy metals on the job.
Exposure to excessive amounts of mercury can be toxic. The amount of mercury absorbed by an individual and its effects on the person's health depends on the type of mercury, its concentration, and the nature of exposure. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), very little metallic mercury (less than 0.01%) is absorbed by the body, even if it is swallowed. However, if the same mercury is inhaled as a vapor, about 80% is absorbed into the bloodstream.
About 95% of methyl mercury, which is the type found in fish and other seafood, is absorbed by the digestive tract. The most common source of human exposure to methyl mercury is eating contaminated seafood. Fish that come from contaminated waters and large predator fish that have eaten smaller fish may have significantly increased levels of methyl mercury. It is important to know the source of the fish that you consume and to limit the quantity of large predator fish eaten.
Once mercury is absorbed, the body may deposit it in a variety of body organs, including the kidneys and brain. The body will slowly rid itself of mercury through the urine and stool, but if an excessive amount accumulates, it can permanently damage the kidneys, nervous system, and brain.
Pregnant women with elevated levels of mercury can pass it on to their unborn baby, affecting development of the baby's brain, kidneys, and nerves especially. Mercury can also be passed from mother to baby through breast milk during nursing."

Chlamydia testing identifies the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis as the cause of your infection.
The preferred method for chlamydia testing is the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) that detects the genetic material (DNA) of Chlamydia trachomatis. It is generally more sensitive and specific than other chlamydia tests and can be performed on a vaginal swab on women or urine from both men and women, which eliminates the need for a pelvic exam in women.
Screening for, diagnosing, and treating chlamydia is very important in preventing long-term complications and spread of the infection to others. Chlamydia infections are especially common among people 15 to 24 years of age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 2.86 million Americans are infected with chlamydia each year and notes that women are frequently re-infected if their partners don't get treatment. The actual number of cases may be higher since many people do not experience any symptoms and do not get tested and diagnosed. Still, over one million new cases are reported each year.
Chlamydia is generally spread through sexual contact (oral, vaginal, or anal) with an infected partner. Risk factors include having multiple sex partners, infection with another STD at the same time or previous STD infection, and not using a condom correctly and consistently.
Many people with chlamydia infections have no symptoms and some may experience only mild symptoms. Signs and symptoms of chlamydia are similar to and can be confused with those cause by another STD, gonorrhea, so tests for these infections are often done at the same time.
Chlamydia is easily treated with a course of antibiotics. If not diagnosed and treated, it can cause severe reproductive and other health problems.
In women, untreated chlamydia infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from infections that start on the cervix but spread to the fallopian tubes and ovaries. This can cause: Long-term (chronic) pelvic pain
Infertility
An increased risk of tubal (ectopic) pregnancy, which can be fatal If you are infected while pregnant, you may experience premature labor, premature rupture of the membranes and your baby may be born with a low birth weight. You can pass the infection to your baby during childbirth. Infected babies are at risk of developing complications such as pneumonia or conjunctivitis, an inflammation that, left untreated, can threaten eyesight.
Rarely, men who are not treated may experience infertility."

AFP levels are normally elevated when a baby is born and then decline rapidly. Outside of pregnancy and birth, liver damage and certain cancers can increase AFP levels significantly. This test measures the level of AFP in your blood.
AFP is produced whenever liver cells are regenerating. With chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, AFP may be chronically elevated. Very high concentrations of AFP may be produced by certain tumors. This characteristic makes the AFP test useful as a tumor marker. Increased amounts of AFP are found in many people with the most common type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma and in a rare type of liver cancer that most commonly occurs in infants called hepatoblastoma. They are also found in some people with cancers of the testicles or ovaries.
AFP exists in several different forms. The standard AFP test is for a total AFP, one that measures all of the AFP forms together. This is the primary AFP test used in the United States.
One of the AFP forms is called L3. The AFP-L3% test is a relatively new test that compares the amount of AFP-L3 to the total amount of AFP. An increase in the percentage of L3 is associated with increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in the near future and of having a poorer prognosis, as the L3-related cancers tend to be more aggressive.
Among people with low total AFP, AFP-L3 can be higher in those with hepatocellular carcinoma than in people with benign liver diseases. Tumor markers including total AFP and AFP-L3 are used in addition to ultrasound for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. This practice is different from that in the U.S. and Europe, but the two tests are occasionally ordered by healthcare practitioners in the U.S."

The gastrointestinal pathogen panel simultaneously tests for the presence of multiple disease-causing (pathogenic) microbes in a stool sample.
The GI pathogen panel detects the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of some of the more common pathogens. It can identify co-infections (more than one microbe causing infection) and identify microbes that might be missed with traditional testing. Results of a GI pathogen panel may be available within a few hours, compared to a few days with some traditional testing.
GI infections are often caused by ingesting food or fluid that has been contaminated by bacteria, viruses or, more rarely, parasites. Examples of contaminated sources include raw or undercooked eggs, poultry or beef, unpasteurized milk, and untreated water from lakes, streams, and (occasionally) from community water supplies. (For more, read Food and Waterborne Illness.)
Microbes causing an infection are shed into (present in) the stool of infected people. Because of this, infections can spread to other people through exposure to infected stool. If people with GI infections don't wash their hands well after using the bathroom, they can spread the infection when others come into contact with surfaces that an infected person has touched, such as door knobs or hand rails. Individuals with diarrheal illness should avoid preparing food for others whenever possible.
Some GI infections are caused by the overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridium difficile. This can cause a decrease in the normally protective ""good bacteria"" (normal flora) in the lower intestines. This may occur, for example, when treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to the suppression of normal flora and the growth of antibiotic-resistant C. difficile.
While a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites can cause GI infections, the list of common ones is much smaller. A healthcare practitioner may have an idea about the cause based upon a person's recent food and drink, medical history, and/or recent travel but will not be able to positively identify the microbe without testing.
If a person's illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, the healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in the stool, or if it is continuing unabated, then a GI pathogen panel may be ordered. Diarrhea can be sometimes be serious if not diagnosed and treated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diarrhea is a global killer. It is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 worldwide, killing an estimated 2,195 children a day.
Testing may be also be done if the person has been outside the U.S. and/or has eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to them ill. The CDC estimates that 30% to 70% of those who travel outside of the U.S. will get a GI infection.
Traditional testing has included a stool culture to identify pathogenic bacteria, an ova and parasite test (O&P) exam to identify parasites, and/or multiple other tests – such as antigen tests. These tests are useful, but some bacteria can be hard to grow successfully in culture, some parasites can be missed if present in low numbers, and testing for viruses is not routinely available. Many tests are also labor-intensive, and it may take 2-3 days or more before a healthcare practitioner has a definitive answer.
If a person has a GI infection caused by a less common bacterium, parasite, or virus not included in the GI pathogen panel, then it will not be detected. Additional tests, such as a stool culture or O&P exam, may be required to help establish a diagnosis."

The test actually measures the rate of fall (sedimentation) of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in a sample of blood that has been placed into a tall, thin, vertical tube. Results are reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour.
When a sample of blood is placed in a tube, the red blood cells normally settle out relatively slowly, leaving little clear plasma. The red cells settle at a faster rate in the presence of an increased level of proteins, particularly proteins called acute phase reactants. The level of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen increases in the blood in response to inflammation.
Inflammation is part of the body's immune response. It can be acute, developing rapidly after trauma, injury or infection, for example, or can occur over an extended time (chronic) with conditions such as autoimmune diseases or cancer.
The ESR is not diagnostic; it is a non-specific test that may be elevated in a number of these different conditions. It provides general information about the presence or absence of an inflammatory condition.
There have been questions about the usefulness of the ESR in light of newer tests that have come into use that are more specific. However, ESR test is typically indicated for the diagnosis and monitoring of temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Extremely elevated ESR is useful in developing a rheumatic disease differential diagnosis. In addition, ESR may still be a good option in some situations, when, for example, the newer tests are not available in areas with limited resources or when monitoring the course of a disease."

Testing detects the genetic material (RNA) of the Zika virus in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or amniotic fluid or detects antibodies in the blood produced in response to Zika virus infection.
About 80% of individuals infected with Zika virus will have no symptoms at all, while others will have only mild illness. For people who do develop symptoms, prognosis is very good for full recovery. The most common initial symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye) lasting from a few days to a week. These symptoms are similar to other mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever and chikungunaya. The similarities between Zika symptoms and other diseases mean that laboratory testing is essential to diagnosing Zika virus.
Zika virus infection is typically diagnosed with blood and urine tests. Laboratory tests may include either molecular tests for Zika virus (PCR), which detect the presence of the virus itself, or an antibody test that detects antibodies produced by the immune system after a person has been exposed to the virus.
Since the first human case of Zika virus in 1952, outbreaks have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was found in Brazil in May 2015, representing the virus' first introduction to the Americas. Since then, it has rapidly spread through the Americas. Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) web page for updates and more information about Zika virus status in the U.S.
While most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop noticeable or severe symptoms, it can cause risk of serious complications for a pregnant woman and her unborn child, including miscarriage and birth defects. Starting in May 2015, Brazilian health officials reported an increase in Zika infections along with an uptick in babies born with microcephaly (smaller than expected heads). Since the outbreak that started in Brazil, the CDC has confirmed that Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause severe microcephaly and other birth defects.
Babies with microcephaly have much smaller heads than normal and severe microcephaly causes a range of lifelong problems, including developmental disabilities, seizures, hearing loss, and vision loss. Scientists are still learning about other impacts of Zika infection during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or considering pregnancy, the CDC web page has up-to-date recommendations on how to protect yourself.
In rare cases, Zika virus is also linked to the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body to attack its own nervous system, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Researchers are still working to understand what causes GBS, but most people with GBS develop it after a viral or bacterial infection. The CDC is still investigating the relationship between Zika and GBS.
In January 2016, the CDC issued a travel alert for areas of the world where Zika virus is circulating. The alert recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to certain areas with Zika, and that women considering pregnancy consult their healthcare providers before traveling to those areas. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus. Avoiding Aedes mosquito bites is the best way to prevent a Zika infection.
Since information about Zika is changing quickly, check the CDC's web site for the latest on the virus."

Renin is an enzyme that controls aldosterone production. These tests measure the levels of aldosterone and renin in the blood and/or the level of aldosterone in urine.
Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal glands located at the top of each kidney, in their outer portion (called the adrenal cortex). Aldosterone stimulates the retention of sodium (salt) and the elimination of potassium by the kidneys. Renin is produced by the kidneys and controls the activation of the hormone angiotensin, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce aldosterone.
The kidneys release renin when there is a drop in blood pressure or a decrease in sodium chloride concentration in the tubules in the kidney. Renin cleaves the blood protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I, which is then converted by a second enzyme to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, and it stimulates aldosterone production. Overall, this raises blood pressure and keeps sodium and potassium at normal levels.
A variety of conditions can lead to aldosterone overproduction (hyperaldosteronism, usually just called aldosteronism) or underproduction (hypoaldosteronism). Since renin and aldosterone are so closely related, both substances are often tested together to identify the cause of an abnormal aldosterone."

In some cases, blood is collected from the renal (for renin) or adrenal (for aldosterone) veins by insertion of a catheter; this is done in the hospital at major medical centers by a specially trained radiologist."

Methotrexate prevents cells from using folate to make DNA and RNA, slowing growth of new cancer cells. Because it can also deter growth of new skin cells, methotrexate is also used to treat psoriasis. The drug blocks several enzymes involved in the immune system and can minimize joint damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
Methotrexate must be carefully monitored. Even when used correctly, it can cause significant side effects. Increased concentrations can be toxic, potentially damaging the liver, kidneys, and lungs and suppressing cell production in the bone marrow.
Methotrexate dosing depends upon the condition being treated. Methotrexate levels in the blood typically rise after a dose and then fall gradually. Methotrexate is eliminated from the body by the kidneys, so any condition that decreases kidney function or interferes with drug clearance has the potential to increase blood concentrations."

The primary reason that a person may have RBC antibodies circulating in the blood is because the person has been exposed, through blood transfusion or through pregnancy, to RBCs other than his or her own (foreign RBCs). These antibodies have the potential to cause harm if a person is transfused with red blood cells that the antibodies may target or if a pregnant woman has antibodies that target the red cells of her developing baby.
RBCs normally have structures on their surface called antigens. People have their own individual set of antigens on their RBCs, determined by inheritance from their parents. The major antigens or surface identifiers on human RBCs are the O, A, and B antigens, and a person's blood is grouped into an A, B, AB, or O blood type according to the presence or absence of these antigens.
Another important surface antigen is Rh factor, also called D antigen. If it is present on a person's red blood cells, that person's blood type is Rh+ (positive); if it is absent, the blood is type Rh- (negative). (For more on these antigens, see the article on Blood Typing). In addition, there are many other types of RBC antigens that make up lesser-known blood groups, such as Kell, Lewis, and Kidd blood groups.
There are a few reasons why someone may produce antibodies against RBC antigens. Following blood transfusions: Antibodies directed against A and B red cell antigens are naturally-occurring; we produce them without having to be exposed to the antigens. Before receiving a blood transfusion, a person's ABO group and Rh type are matched with that of donor blood to prevent a serious transfusion reaction from occurring. That is, the donor's blood must be compatible with the recipient's so that antibodies do not react with and destroy donor blood cells. 	If someone receives a blood transfusion, the person's body may also recognize other RBC antigens from other blood groups (such as Kell or Kidd) that the person does not have as foreign. The recipient may produce antibodies to attack these foreign antigens. People who have many transfusions make antibodies to RBCs because they are exposed to foreign RBC antigens with each transfusion. During pregnancy, with blood type incompatibility between mother and baby: A baby may inherit antigens from the father that are not on the mother's RBCs. The mother may be exposed during pregnancy or at delivery to the foreign antigens on her baby's RBCs when some of the baby's cells enter the mother's circulation as the placenta separates. The mother may begin to produce antibodies against these foreign RBC antigens. This can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn, usually not affecting the first baby but affecting subsequent children when the mother's antibodies cross the placenta, attach to the baby's RBCs, and hemolyze them. An RBC antibody screen can help determine if the mother has produced RBC antibodies outside of the ABO blood group. The first time a person is exposed to a foreign RBC antigen, by transfusion or pregnancy, the person may begin to produce antibodies but his or her cells do not usually have the time during the first exposure to make enough antibodies to actually destroy the foreign RBCs. When the next transfusion or pregnancy occurs, the immune response may be strong enough for enough antibodies to be produced, attach to, and break apart (hemolyze) the transfused RBCs or the baby's RBCs. Antibodies to the ABO antigens are naturally-occurring so do not require exposure to foreign RBCs.
RBC antibodies that are detected with a screen can be identified with an antibody identification test."

These disease-causing microbes are called pathogens. The respiratory pathogens panel tests for the presence of multiple disease-causing microbes in a single respiratory sample.
While a wide variety of viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory infections, the list of common ones is much smaller. A healthcare practitioner may have an idea about the cause based upon the season, your signs and symptoms and medical history, and in some cases recent travel, but will not be able to positively identify the microbe without testing.
The respiratory pathogen panel is a molecular test that detects the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of some of the more common pathogens. It can identify co-infections (more than one microbe causing infection) and identify microbes that might be missed with traditional testing, such as culture. Some panels can also identify subtypes or strains of microbes. Results of a respiratory pathogen panel may be available within a few hours, compared to a few days with some traditional testing.
The number and type of microbes tested depends on the specific panel used. Some panels are limited to testing for a few types of viruses that are the most common causes of respiratory infections, while other panels are more comprehensive and test for a wider variety of respiratory viruses and bacteria in a single sample.
Examples of some of the microbes that might be tested include (these can vary from one panel to another):
Viruses: Influenza A and B (flu)
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Parainfluenza virus
Rhinovirus
Adenovirus
Coronavirus
Enterovirus
Human metapneumovirus Bacteria: Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) and Bordetella parapertussis
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Mycoplasma pneumoniae Respiratory infections
Respiratory infections are common and can be very contagious, spreading from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and contact with contaminated surfaces. People may be infectious before their symptoms begin to several days after they become sick.
Some examples of common respiratory infections include: Common colds—viral infections that cause sneezing, coughing, sore throat and runny or stuffy nose
Bronchitis—infections can cause inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs (bronchial tubes) with symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath
Croup—an infection of the windpipe and airways leading to the lungs that causes hoarseness and a cough that sounds like a seal or dog
Pneumonia—infection of the lower respiratory tract that can cause coughing, fever, chills, muscle aches and shortness of breath Viral respiratory infections caused by influenza A or B (the flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are largely seasonal in the United States, with the cold and flu season running from late fall through early spring. During each season there are multiple strains of influenza and a variety of other viruses causing very similar ""flu-like"" symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose the cause of infection based on symptoms and medical history alone. Some viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory infections and complications year-round.
Respiratory infections can cause a spectrum of illness, from mild to severe, and can sometimes be fatal. All ages can be affected, but the highest infection rates and the most severe complications are typically seen in the very young, in people with weakened (compromised) immune systems, and especially in the elderly. People in close contact with one another or in confined spaces, such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and the military, are also at increased risk of infection.
The number of people with respiratory infections varies from year to year. For instance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Influenza: the number of cases of influenza illness during the 2017-2018 season was the highest it had been since 2009. The CDC estimates that 48.8 million people became sick with influenza, about 959,000 were hospitalized, and 79,400 died.
RSV: on average there are 2.1 million outpatient visits and 57,527 hospitalizations in children under the age of 5, and 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults older than the age of 65.
Common cold: millions of cases of the common cold occur each year (typically caused by rhinoviruses, but also by other viruses included in the respiratory pathogen panel)."

Unlike more common forms of arthritis caused by wear and tear on the joints over time, RA is a type of autoimmune disorder.
In RA, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy joint tissue, causing inflammation and degeneration of the joints. Over time, cartilage, bone, and ligaments of a person’s joint can wear away and can cause the joint to become bent, twisted, or scarred.
Rheumatoid arthritis usually occurs in a symmetrical way. For example, if one wrist is affected, the other wrist is likely affected as well. Although RA most often affects the wrists and fingers, it can also impact other joints, including the elbows, neck, shoulders, hips, knees, and feet. RA may also cause other health conditions of the blood vessels, heart, lungs, nerves, eyes, and skin.
Although the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is unknown, researchers believe that this condition may develop when a person with an increased risk for RA is exposed to factors in their environment that trigger inflammation. Increasing age, female sex, and genetics increase a person’s risk for RA, while environmental triggers that can lead to inflammation and RA include certain bacterial infections, cigarette smoking, and stress.
However, just because someone has risk factors and is exposed to environmental triggers does not mean that they will develop RA. Similarly, some people develop RA with no known risk factors or triggers."

The test measures the amount of IGF-1 in the blood.
IGF-1 is primarily produced in the liver, skeletal muscles, and many other tissues in response to GH stimulation. IGF-1 mediates many of the actions of GH, stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues, and promotes the production of lean muscle mass. IGF-1 also plays a role in non-growth activities, such as glucose and lipid metabolism, and has been implicated in metabolic syndrome.
Since GH is released into the blood in pulses throughout the day, it is difficult to interpret the results from a single GH test. IGF-1 mirrors GH excesses and deficiencies, but unlike GH, its level is stable throughout the day. This makes IGF-1 a useful indicator of average GH levels. The IGF-1 test is therefore often used to help evaluate for GH deficiency or GH excess.
IGF-1 and Growth Deficiency
IGF-1 levels, like GH, are normally low in infancy, increase gradually during childhood, peak during puberty, and then decline in adult life. Deficiencies in GH and IGF-1 may be caused by: A dysfunctional pituitary gland with decreased pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism)
A non-GH-producing pituitary tumor that damages cells that produce hormones
A lack of responsiveness to GH. This insensitivity may be primary (genetic) or secondary to conditions such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, sex hormone deficiency, kidney disease, liver disease, and congenital syndromes. Genetic GH insensitivity (GH resistance) is very rare, with about 300 cases reported worldwide. IGF-1 deficiencies can inhibit bone growth and overall growth development, resulting in a child with a shorter than normal stature. In adults, decreased production can lead to low bone density, less muscle mass, and altered lipid levels. However, testing for IGF-1 deficiency or GH deficiency is not routinely done in adults who have decreased bone density and/or muscle strength or increased lipids. GH deficiency and consequently IGF-1 deficiency is a very rare cause of these disorders.
IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Excess
Excess GH and IGF-1 can cause abnormal growth of the skeleton and other signs and symptoms characteristic of two rare conditions, gigantism and acromegaly, generally due to a pituitary adenoma, a slow-growing, often benign tumor. This causes the pituitary to release excess amounts of GH. Frequently, the tumor can be surgically removed and/or treated with drugs or radiation. In most cases, this will cause GH and IGF-1 levels to return to normal or near-normal levels.
In children, gigantism causes bones to grow longer, resulting in a very tall person with large feet and hands. In adults, acromegaly causes bones to thicken and tissues to soften, as seen with the swelling of the nose. In contrast to giantism, adults with acromegaly do not grow tall. Both conditions can lead to enlarged organs (heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, thyroid/parathyroid glands, pancreas) and other complications such as type 2 diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, mild increase in cancer (breast, colon, prostate, lung), and a decreased lifespan."

In the kidneys, B2M passes through blood-filtering units called the glomeruli and is then reabsorbed by the renal proximal tubules, structures that reclaim water, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other vital substances. Normally, only small amounts of B2M are present in the urine, but when the renal tubules become damaged or diseased, B2M concentrations increase due to the decreased ability to reabsorb this protein. When the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged, they are unable to filter out B2M, so the level in the blood rises."

The mono test detects proteins in the blood called heterophile antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to an EBV infection.
Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by a particular set of symptoms that most often affects adolescents. People who have mono often have a fever, sore throat, swollen glands, and fatigue. Many will also have an enlarged spleen, and a few may have an enlarged liver. Symptoms of the infection usually arise about one month after the initial infection and may last for several weeks. The associated fatigue may last for several months. Mono is usually a self-limiting condition; the symptoms resolve without any specific treatment.
Epstein-Barr virus is very common and very contagious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people in the United States are infected by EBV at some point in their lives. The virus is present in the saliva of an infected person and is easily spread from person to person through close contact such as kissing and through sharing utensils or cups.
Most of the time, EBV infection occurs in childhood and causes few or no symptoms. However, it can cause symptoms associated with infectious mononucleosis in about 25% of teens and young adults, according to the CDC. Mono can affect anyone at any age, but its prevalence is highest in populations of young people, such as students in high schools or colleges, or in the military.
The mono test is 71% to 90% accurate and may be used as an initial test for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis. However, the test does have a 25% false-negative rate due to the fact that some people infected with EBV do not produce the heterophile antibodies that the mono test is designed to detect. If a mono test is negative and suspicion it still high, then a test specific for EBV antibodies is usually performed.
A complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear are usually also performed, as mono is also characterized by a high white blood cell (WBC) count and the presence of atypical white blood cells (usually reported as reactive lymphocytes) as seen on a blood smear.
According to the CDC, examples of other causes of mono include: Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
HIV
Rubella
Toxoplasmosis"

These tests measure the amount of theophylline or caffeine in the blood to help establish an appropriate dose, to maintain a therapeutic level, and to evaluate toxic concentrations.
Theophylline is one of several medications that may be taken by children and adults who have asthma and by adults who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a bronchodilator and functions to relax the muscles in the lungs. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, in which too little theophylline is ineffective and too much can cause toxicity. Both short-acting and long-acting formulations are available for asthma treatments. Acute theophylline toxicity presents with rapid heart rate and nausea. Chronic theophylline toxicity is associated with an increased risk of seizures and abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias). Both acute and chronic toxicity can be life-threatening.
Caffeine is frequently used for adults as a pain reliever (analgesic), migraine remedies, and to remain alert and/or awake. It is also the preferred medication to treat apnea in premature newborns who stop breathing. Apnea compromises the amount of oxygen available to the body. It is a common and serious condition in premature newborns that must be promptly treated and closely monitored. While both medications can reduce episodes of apnea, caffeine has fewer side effects than theophylline and, thus, a lower risk of toxicity. At very high doses, symptoms similar to those found with theophylline toxicity may be seen.
Establishing and maintaining therapeutic doses can be a challenge. Both theophylline and caffeine levels may need to be monitored because the range of concentrations in which the drugs are effective but not toxic is narrow and in some cases the dose given does not always correlate well with concentrations in the blood.
The rate at which the drugs are processed by the body (metabolized) will vary from person to person. Metabolism is decreased in both the very young and the elderly and increased in smokers. The drug levels may also be affected by underlying conditions such as pneumonia, liver disease, hypothyroidism, and by acute infection or illness. Many drugs interact and interfere with the metabolism of theophylline and caffeine. They may increase or decrease its rate of metabolism."

There are two distinct subtypes of systemic sclerosis that are defined based on how much of the skin is affected: Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis that affects the entire body
Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis that is typically associated with one or more symptoms that are known collectively as CREST syndrome CREST syndrome symptoms include: Calcinosis – calcium deposits under the skin
Raynaud phenomenon – episodes of decreased blood flow to fingers and toes, causing them to turn white and blue
Esophageal dysfunction – difficulty swallowing, acid reflux, and heartburn
Sclerodactyly – tight, thick, shiny skin on the hands and fingers
Telangiectasia – red spots on skin due to swollen capillaries Other signs that may be considered in scleroderma include fingertip lesions, abnormal capillaries in the skin just below the fingernails, high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and/or scarring of the lungs (interstitial lung disease).

Autoantibodies attack a person's own tissues, mistakenly identifying the tissue as ""foreign."" While the biologic role of RF is not well understood, its presence is useful as an indicator of inflammatory and autoimmune activity. This test detects and measures RF in the blood and may be used, along with other tests, to help in the diagnose of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, pain, stiffness, and destructive changes in the hands, feet, and other joints throughout the body. Some patients may show signs of fatigue, low-grade fevers, and weight loss.
It can affect anyone at any age but usually develops in the late child-bearing years in women and between the ages of 60 to 80 in men. Over 70% of those affected with RA are women. The course of RA and its prognosis are variable. It may develop and progress slowly or rapidly. It may go into remission in some people and, in a few, it may go away. Left untreated, RA can shorten a person's lifespan and can, within a few years, leave many of those affected too disabled to work.
There are a variety of treatments available to minimize the complications of RA, but they depend on making an accurate diagnosis and on beginning treatment before the development of significant joint damage.
Rheumatoid factor has been used to detect RA. Because the sensitivity and specificity of RF are not ideal, other laboratory tests are often performed in conjunction with RF testing. About 80% of those with RA will have a positive RF test, but it can be negative in people who have clinical signs of RA.
A test for cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP) may be done along with an RF test as studies have shown that the CCP antibody test has a sensitivity and specificity that is considered better than RF and is more likely to be positive with early RA. Other tests that may be performed are: Complete blood count (CBC, for anemia & thrombocytosis)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)
Synovial fluid analysis (inflammatory joints) Elevated RF can be found in a small percentage (5-10%) of healthy people. RF may also be elevated in the elderly, though they may not demonstrate clinical signs. In addition, elevated levels of RF may be detected in people who do not have RA (false positive) but may have another disorder: Sjögren syndrome

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/torch,TORCH,['TORCH Panel'],['TORCH Test'],"January 29, 2016.","September 22, 2020.",What is being tested?,"TORCH is an acronym for a group of infectious diseases that can cause illness in pregnant women and may cause birth defects in their newborns. The TORCH panel is a group of blood tests that detect the presence of antibodies produced by the immune system in response to these infections. Confirmation of an active infection may require more specific tests.
The following tests make up the TORCH panel: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can be passed from mother to baby through the placenta during pregnancy. An infection with Toxoplasma gondii can cause eye and central nervous system infections as well as brain and muscle cysts. If acquired during the pregnancy, it may result in a miscarriage or cause birth defects, though this depends on the time during the pregnancy when the infection was acquired by the mother. Toxoplasmosis is acquired by ingesting the parasite when handling the stool of infected cats, drinking unpasteurized goat's milk, and, most commonly, by eating contaminated meat.
Rubella is the virus that causes German measles. If contracted early in the pregnancy, an infant may develop heart disease, retarded growth, hearing loss, blood disorders, vision problems, or pneumonia. Problems that may develop during childhood include central nervous system disease, immune disorders, or thyroid disease.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is another viral infection that a mother may have acquired. More than half of all American adults have been infected with CMV at some point in their life and, in most cases, it does not cause severe illness. However, it may pass to a baby during the birth process and can also infect newborns through breast milk. Infected infants may have severe problems, such as hearing loss, vision problems, mental retardation, pneumonia, and seizures.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common viral infection. The two most common infections with HSV are ""cold sores"" affecting the lips and genital herpes. Both of these infections can recur. HSV is most commonly acquired through oral or genital contact. Newborns who contract the virus usually do so during travel through the birth canal of a woman who has a genital infection with HSV. The virus may spread throughout the newborn's body, attacking vital organs. Treatment with specific antiviral medication should begin as soon as possible in the infected newborn. Even if treated, surviving babies may have permanent damage to their central nervous system. Other infections that may be tested for at the same time include syphilis, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and parvovirus B19."

Normally, antibodies protect against infection, but autoantibodies are produced when a person's immune system fails to adequately distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self."" They mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells, causing tissue and organ damage. Anti-dsDNA specifically targets the genetic material (DNA) found in the nucleus of a cell, hence the name ""anti-dsDNA."" The anti-dsDNA test identifies the presence of these autoantibodies in the blood.
While anti-dsDNA may be present at a low level with a number of disorders, it is primarily associated with lupus. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that can affect various tissues and/or organs of the body such as the kidneys, joints, blood vessels, skin, heart, lungs, and the brain. (For more on this, read the article on Lupus). The test for anti-dsDNA, along with other autoantibody tests, may be used to help establish a diagnosis of lupus and distinguish it from other autoimmune disorders.
One serious complication of lupus is lupus nephritis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the kidneys, which can lead to protein in the urine, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. It occurs when autoantibodies bind to antigens that have been deposited in the kidneys. In the evaluation of someone with lupus nephritis, a high level (titer) of anti-dsDNA is generally associated with ongoing inflammation and damage to the kidneys."

CSF testing is performed to evaluate the level or concentration of different substances and cells in CSF in order to diagnose conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
CSF is produced and secreted by the choroid plexus, a special tissue that has many blood vessels and that lines the small cavities or chambers (ventricles) in the brain. The total CSF volume is 3-5 ounces (90-150 mL) in adults and 0.3-2 ounces (10-60 mL) in newborns. CSF is continually produced, circulated, and then absorbed into the blood. About 17 ounces (500 mL) of CSF are produced each day. This rate of production means that all the CSF is replaced every few hours.
A protective, semi-permeable barrier separates the brain from the bloodstream. This blood-brain barrier allows some substances to cross and prevents other substances from crossing. Importantly, it helps keep large molecules, toxins, and most blood cells away from the central nervous system. Any condition that disrupts this protective barrier may result in a change in the normal level or makeup of CSF. Because CSF surrounds the brain and spinal cord, testing a sample of CSF can be very valuable in diagnosing a variety of conditions affecting the central nervous system.
Although a sample of CSF may be more difficult to obtain than, for example, urine or blood, the results of CSF testing may reveal more directly the cause of central nervous system conditions. The following are some examples: Meningitis, an infection of the layers that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges), and encephalitis, an infection in the brain
Autoimmune diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis
Cancers of the central nervous system or cancers that have spread to the central nervous system, such as leukemia

When the area has become numb, a special needle is inserted through the skin, between two vertebrae, and into your spinal canal. An ""opening"" or initial pressure reading of the CSF is obtained. The healthcare practitioner then collects a small amount of CSF in multiple sterile vials. A ""closing"" pressure is obtained, the needle is withdrawn, and a sterile dressing and pressure are applied to the puncture site.

This information can be helpful in diagnosing a B-cell lymphoma.
B-cells are a type of lymphocyte (a kind of white blood cell, WBC) that produces antibodies in response to infections or other ""foreign invaders."" Rearrangements in certain parts of their DNA called immunoglobulin genes are a normal part of their development. These rearrangements are associated with the development of a large repertoire of diverse B-cells, allowing them to protect against many different kinds of infections. The final order in which the genes are rearranged is called a gene rearrangement profile. Within any normal population (sample) of B cells, the cells and their gene rearrangement profiles are very diverse.
In a B-cell lymphoma, the lymphoma cells are virtually identical and their gene rearrangement profiles are likewise identical. Lymphomas arise when an abnormal B cell begins to produce numerous identical copies of itself (clones). The cloned cells grow and divide uncontrollably, crowding out normal cells.
A B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement test evaluates the cells in a person's sample to determine whether the majority of B-cell rearrangement profiles are diverse or identical. This information, along with clinical signs and symptoms and results of other laboratory tests, can help clarify a person's diagnosis, or evaluate the persistence or recurrence of lymphoma.
About 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the U.S. are B-cell lymphomas, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).

When the body is exposed to antigen, such as bacteria or viruses, the B-cell immunoglobulin genes undergo a permanent rearrangement in order to produce antibodies directed against that threat.

These rearrangements are normal. The immunoglobulin genes consist of numerous, discontinuous coding segments. As B cells develop and mature, a portion of DNA that contains one full DNA sequence of one of the genes breaks into pieces. After rearrangement, only some of the pieces are kept, which are joined back together in a specific set of steps. To visualize this, imagine that you have a piece of paper with a set of instructions on it, several paragraphs long and containing hundreds of words. Now imagine that you pick and choose words from multiple locations on the page – a sufficient number to form a sentence. Then you get rid of the rest of the words and put together your sentence. You started with a page and ended up with a sentence, but both make sense as you read them and, in this case, both represent ""functional genes."" It is not hard to see that many different sentences could have been constructed from the same set of instructions. In a similar fashion, the B-cell customization process can be used to produce a large number of unique B-cell gene arrangements."

VWF testing measures the amount of the protein present in blood and determines how well the protein functions.
Normally, when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeding begins, VWF forms an adhesive bridge between activated cell fragments called platelets and the injury site. This is followed by the clumping (aggregation) of platelets at the site and a series of actions referred to as activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in the formation of a stable blood clot.
VWF further affects clotting by influencing the availability of coagulation factor VIII. VWF carries factor VIII in the blood, increases its half-life, and releases it as necessary. If the amount of functional VWF is insufficient, then platelet adherence and aggregation are affected, levels of factor VIII could be decreased, blood clot formation takes longer, and therefore bleeding is prolonged. This deficiency causes a condition referred to as von Willebrand disease (VWD).
VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It is a group of conditions associated with prolonged bleeding due to deficient and/or defective VWF. VWD is separated into different types and sub-types, including: Type 1 – with this type of VWD, there is a decrease in the amount of VWF produced, but the VWF functions normally. Levels of factor VIII are also typically low but may be normal. This is the most common type of VWD, accounting for about 75% of cases. It tends to cause bruising and mild to moderate bleeding, such as persistent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods, and prolonged bleeding following childbirth, trauma, dental procedures, and surgeries. Symptoms and the severity of bleeding will vary from person to person and from episode to episode.
Type 2 – this type is associated with a normal amount of VWF, but the VWF does not function normally. Bleeding may be more severe with this with this type. Type 2 is further divided into Types 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N.
Type 3 – this rare type is associated with very little VWF production, very low factor VIII levels, and moderate to severe symptoms. It is often detected in infancy because of early bleeding episodes. Rarely, VWD may be due to an acquired VWF deficiency, where there is no family or personal bleeding history up to the point when signs and symptoms develop.
Von Willebrand factor testing includes VWF antigen, which measures the amount of VWF, and VWF activity (also known as Ristocetin Cofactor), which evaluates the function of VWF. Some laboratories may offer a panel that includes both of these tests along with a factor VIII activity test."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/phenobarbital,Phenobarbital,"['Pb', 'Phenobarb']",[],"November 28, 2019.","March 12, 2020.",What is being tested?,"Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate, an anti-epileptic drug (AED) and sedating drug that depresses the nervous system. Healthcare practitioners usually prescribe it to prevent seizures or to relieve anxiety. It is often prescribed to treat epilepsy and other seizure disorders because the drug stabilizes electrical activity in the brain. This test measures the phenobarbital level in the blood.
When you are being treated with phenobarbital, it is important to maintain a stable level of phenobarbital in the blood within the therapeutic range. If the level is too low, you may experience seizures or anxiety. If the level is too high, you could experience side effects or even toxicity. The toxic effects include drowsiness, confusion, and lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movement (ataxia), which can affect things like driving performance. If you are treated long-term, you may also develop tolerance to the sedative effects of the drug and become psychologically or physically dependent.
Maintaining a constant, therapeutic level of phenobarbital in the blood can be difficult. The gap between the level at which the drug is therapeutic and the level at which toxic side effects can occur is very small. This is called a narrow therapeutic index and is a primary reason the drug requires close monitoring.
Furthermore, phenobarbital is broken down (metabolized) by liver enzymes and eliminated in the urine at different rates, depending on your age and overall health. For different dose, age and health, elimination can take several days to weeks. Once the body has reached its maximum capacity to metabolize phenobarbital, even small increases in dose can result in large increases of the drug level in the blood. Side effects can become more severe and toxicity may occur.
Your healthcare provider will monitor your response to phenobarbital to make sure that the desired level of the drug is maintained in the blood and to determine the dose that works best for you. Your healthcare practitioner might order a phenobarbital level at the start of treatment and any time while you are on the medication to determine if the dose is right. The practitioner might also decide to order a test if you begin taking another medication because clinically significant drug interactions may occur."

Testing detects substances not normally found in the body, with the exception of some hormones and steroids measured as part of sports testing.
Drug abuse testing usually involves an initial screening test followed by a second test that identifies and/or confirms the presence of a drug or drugs. Most laboratories use commercially available tests that have been developed and optimized to screen urine for the ""major drugs of abuse.""
For most drugs of abuse testing, laboratories compare results of initial screening with a predetermined cut-off. Anything below that cut-off is considered negative; anything above is considered a positive screening result. In addition, labs might perform testing for masking agents (adulterants). These may either interfere with testing or dilute a urine sample.
Among drugs of abuse, each class of drug may contain a variety of chemically similar substances. Legal substances that are chemically similar to illegal ones can produce a positive screening result. Positive screening tests are considered presumptive. Therefore, screening tests that are positive for one or more classes of drugs are frequently confirmed with a secondary test that identifies the exact substance present using a very sensitive and specific method, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Some of the most commonly screened drug classes are listed in the table below.  Drug class screened
Examples of specific drugs identified during confirmation
Amphetamines
Methamphetamine, amphetamine
Barbiturates
Phenobarbital, secobarbital, pentobarbital, butalbital, amobarbital
Benzodiazepines
Diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, alprazolam
Cannibinoids
Marijuana
Cocaine
Cocaine and/or its metabolite (benzoylecognine)
Methadone
Methadone, methadone metabolite (EDDP)
Opiates
Codeine, morphine, metabolite of heroin, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone
Phencyclidine
PCP  See a more comprehensive listing of drug classes and drugs of abuse in the table below.
Substances that are not similar to the defined classes can produce negative results even though they are present. Some drugs may be difficult to detect with the standardized assays, either because the test is not set up to detect the drug, such as methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly), fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone (Oxycontin), meperedine, or buprenorphine, or because the drug does not remain in the body long enough to be detected, such as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).
For sports testing of hormones and steroids, each test performed is usually specific for a single substance and may be quantitative. Athletes, especially those at the national and international levels, are tested for illegal drugs and are additionally prohibited from using a long list of substances called ""performance enhancers.""
Groups of drug tests are typically ordered for medical or legal reasons, as part of a ""drug-free workplace,"" as part of a sports testing program, or to determine compliance with prescribed (pain) medications. People who use these substances ingest, inhale, smoke, or inject them into their bodies. How much of these drugs the body absorbs and their effects depend on the substances, how they interact, their purity and strength, their quantity, timing and method of intake, and an individual's ability to metabolize and eliminate them from the body.
Some drugs can interfere with the action or metabolism of other medications, or have additive effects, as in the case of taking two drugs that both depress the central nervous system (CNS). Drugs may also have competing effects, as can happen when one drug that depresses the CNS and another that stimulates it are taken."

The test distinguishes between the types of bacteria that cause disease (pathogenic) and the types that are normally found in the digestive tract (normal flora). The test helps to determine if pathogenic bacteria are the cause of a person's gastrointestinal symptoms (gastroenteritis).
The bacteria found in stool are representative of the bacteria that are present in the digestive system (gastrointestinal tract). Certain bacteria and fungi called normal flora inhabit everyone's gastrointestinal tract. They play an important role in the digestion of food and their presence keeps a check on the growth of disease-causing bacteria.
Sometimes, the balance of the normal flora may be affected by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; the drugs inhibit the growth of normal flora and allow the bacteria Clostridium difficile that is resistant to the antibiotics to survive and overgrow the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.
Pathogenic bacteria can enter and infect the digestive tract when someone eats food or drinks water that is contaminated. Examples of contaminated sources include raw or undercooked eggs, poultry or beef, unpasteurized milk, and untreated water from lakes, streams, and (occasionally) from community water supplies. (For more on this, see the article Food and Waterborne Illness.)
People who travel outside the U.S., especially to developing nations, may face a greater risk of being exposed to disease-causing bacteria. Some of these bacteria may be true pathogens while others are strains of gastrointestinal bacteria that are normal flora for the local inhabitants but cause gastrointestinal distress to the tourist. Visitors may become infected by eating or drinking anything that has been contaminated with the bacteria, even things as simple as tap water, ice cubes in a drink, a fresh salad, or food from a vendor's stall.
The most common symptoms of a pathogenic bacterial infection are prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, mucus in the stool, abdominal pain and cramping, and nausea. If diarrhea lasts more than a few days, it may lead to complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which can be dangerous conditions, especially for children and the elderly. Dehydration can cause symptoms such as dry skin, fatigue, and light-headedness.
Severely affected people may require hospitalization to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious complication characterized by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure that may occasionally arise from an infection with a toxin-producing strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli. The condition is most frequently seen in children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.
If a person's illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, a healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in the stool, or if it is continuing unabated, then a stool culture may be ordered. This is especially true if the person has been outside the U.S. and/or has eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to them ill.
To aid diagnosis, a stool culture may be done in conjunction with or following a GI pathogens panel that simultaneously tests for multiple disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Other tests that may be done include an ova and parasite exam or antigen tests to identify specific microbes."

Diagnosis can be made by serologic testing or by molecular testing. Serologic testing detects antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to an infection and, depending on the type of antibodies present (IgG or IgM), a current or past infection can be determined. Molecular testing such as PCR detects the genetic material (DNA) of the parasite in the blood and indicates an acute infection.
T. gondii is a parasite that cannot be seen with the naked eye (microscopic). In most healthy humans, the infection either causes no symptoms or results in a mild flu-like illness. When a pregnant woman becomes infected, however, and passes it to her unborn child, or a person with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) becomes infected, the parasite can cause severe complications.
T. gondii is widely distributed. It is found throughout the world and in some countries has infected up to 60% of the population. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 11% of those 6 years of age and older have had toxoplasmosis and that more than 40 million people carry it. The infection can be acquired by: Eating contaminated food, especially eating raw or undercooked meat, such as pork, lamb, and venison
Eating unwashed fruits and vegetables that are grown in contaminated soil
Having contact with contaminated soil
Drinking contaminated water
Drinking unpasteurized milk
Handling contaminated cat litter
Playing in contaminated sandboxes
Transmission from mother-to-child
Rarely, transmission during an organ transplantation or blood transfusion The main hosts for T. gondii are wild and domestic cats. When cats become infected by eating infected birds, rodents, or contaminated raw meat, T. gondii replicates and forms eggs encased in protective coverings (oocysts). During an active infection, millions of microscopic eggs may be released for several weeks into the cat's stool. The eggs become infective within a couple of days and can remain viable for several months. In all other hosts, including humans, T. gondii only goes through a limited portion of its lifecycle and then forms inactive cysts in the muscles, brain, and eyes. The host's immune system keeps these cysts dormant and protects the body against further infection. The dormant stage can persist throughout the host's life, unless the immune system becomes compromised.
An initial or re-activated Toxoplasma gondii infection can cause significant symptoms and complications in people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing chemotherapy, have had a recent organ transplant, or are on immunosuppressant medications. It can affect the nervous system and eyes, causing headaches, seizures, confusion, fever, encephalitis, loss of coordination, and blurred vision.
When a woman becomes infected during pregnancy, there is a 30-40% chance that the infection will be passed to her unborn child. If this congenital infection occurs early in the pregnancy, it can cause miscarriages or stillbirths or can lead to severe complications in the newborn, including mental retardation, seizures, blindness, and an enlarged liver or spleen. Many infected babies, especially those exposed later in the pregnancy, will appear normal at birth but may develop symptoms, such as severe eye infections, hearing loss, and learning disabilities, years later."

Purines are nitrogen-containing compounds found in the cells of the body, including our DNA. This test measures the level of uric acid in the blood or urine.
As cells get old and die, they break down, releasing purines into the blood. To a lesser extent, purines may come from the digestion of certain foods, such as liver, anchovies, mackerel, dried beans and peas and certain alcoholic drinks, primarily beer. Most uric acid is removed from the body by the kidneys and is eliminated from the body in the urine, with the remainder eliminated in the stool.
If too much uric acid is produced or not enough is removed, it can accumulate in the body, causing increased levels in the blood (hyperuricemia). The presence of excess uric acid can cause gout, a condition characterized by inflammation of the joints due to the formation of uric acid crystals in the joint (synovial) fluid. Excess uric acid can also be deposited in tissues such as the kidney, leading to kidney stones or kidney failure.
The build-up of too much uric acid in the body can be due to producing too much, not eliminating enough, or a combination of both. Elevated levels of uric acid can occur when there is an increase in cell death, as seen with some cancer therapies or, rarely, as an inherited tendency to produce too much uric acid. Decreased elimination of uric acid is often a result of impaired kidney function due to kidney disease."

Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but disease-causing (pathogenic) E. coli can cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis). Laboratory tests can detect the presence of pathogenic E. coli that produce Shiga toxins.
Multiple subtypes of E. coli cause diarrheal illness, and they are classified by how they cause the disease. For example, some invade the lining of the intestines, causing inflammation, while others produce toxins.
E. coli that produce poisons called Shiga toxins are generally the only type of E. coli that are tested for in clinical settings from stool specimens. The Shiga toxins associated with these infections are so called because they are related to the toxins produced by another type of disease-causing bacteria, Shigella. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) may also be called verocytotoxic E. coli (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).
A strain of STEC called O157:H7 is the STEC strain responsible for most gastrointestinal illness outbreaks in the U.S. However, non-O157 strains of STEC are gaining recognition, in part due to increased testing for them by clinical laboratories. For example, a 2011 outbreak of E. coli O104:H4, a non-O157 STEC, was associated with travel to Germany and resulted in 32 deaths related to contaminated sprouts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, STEC O157 causes about 36% of STEC infections in the U.S., while non-O157 STEC cause the rest.
Outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of contaminated food, including undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized juice, unpasteurized milk, and raw produce such as leafy greens and alfalfa sprouts. STEC may also be transmitted through contaminated water, contact with farm animals or their environment, and from person to person. Even ingesting small numbers of E. coli can cause an infection.
In addition to symptoms of nausea, severe abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, fatigue, or possible vomiting and low-grade fever, STEC infections are often associated with bloody stools and, less commonly, can lead to serious complications, specifically hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a result of the toxin entering the blood and destroying red blood cells (hemolysis). It can lead to kidney failure (uremia or the build up of nitrogen wastes in the blood) and can be life-threatening. Signs and symptoms include decreased frequency of urination (evidence of uremia), fatigue, and pale skin due to hemolytic anemia. HUS usually develops about a week after the onset of diarrhea.
About 5-10% of people who are diagnosed with an O157 STEC infection develop HUS. Children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk. However, most healthy persons recover from a STEC infection within a week and do not develop HUS. Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli can cause the same symptoms and complications and likely account for 20-50% of STEC infections in the U.S. annually. Different testing techniques are required to identify O157 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli."

Once it has been collected, the stool should be taken to the laboratory immediately or refrigerated and taken to the lab as soon as possible. Some laboratories provide transport media to support the survival of the organism from the time of collection until delivery to the laboratory. STEC becomes difficult to detect in the stool after one week of illness, so the timing of sample collection relative to the onset of illness is important."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/blood-gases,Blood Gases,"['Arterial Blood Gases', 'ABGs']",['Arterial Blood Gas Analysis'],"June 4, 2017.","December 9, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Blood gases are a group of tests that are performed together to measure the pH and the amount of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) present in a sample of blood, usually from an artery, in order to evaluate lung function and help detect an acid-base imbalance that could indicate a respiratory, metabolic or kidney disorder.
A person's body carefully regulates blood pH, maintaining it within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45, not allowing blood to become too acidic (acidosis) nor too alkaline/basic (alkalosis). The body's regulation of acids and bases has two main components. The first component involves both metabolism and the kidneys: the cellular process of converting one substance to another for energy produces large amounts of acid that the kidneys help eliminate. The second component of regulating pH balance involves eliminating carbon dioxide (an acid when dissolved in blood) through exhalation of the lungs. This respiratory component is also the way that the body supplies oxygen to tissues. The lungs inhale oxygen, which is then dissolved in the blood and carried throughout the body to tissues.
These processes of gas exchange and acid/base balance are also closely associated with the body's electrolyte balance. In a normal state of health, these processes are in a dynamic balance and the blood pH is stable. (For more on this, see Acidosis and Alkalosis).
There is a wide range of acute and chronic conditions that can affect kidney function, acid production, and lung function, and they have the potential to cause a pH, carbon dioxide/oxygen, or electrolyte imbalance. Examples include uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to ketoacidosis and metabolic acidosis, and severe lung diseases that can affect CO2/O2 gas exchange. Even temporary conditions such as shock, anxiety, pain, prolonged vomiting, and severe diarrhea can sometimes lead to acidosis or alkalosis.
Blood gas analysis gives a snapshot of a person's blood pH, O2 and CO2 content. The following components are generally included in blood gas analysis: pH—a measure of the balance of acids and bases in the blood. Increased amounts of carbon dioxide and other acids can cause blood pH to decrease (become acidic). Decreased carbon dioxide or increased amounts of bases, like bicarbonate (HCO3-), can cause blood pH to increase (become alkaline).
Partial pressure of O2 (PaO2)—measures the amount of oxygen gas in the blood.
Partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2)—measures the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the blood. As PaCO2 levels rise, blood pH decreases, making the blood more acidic; as PaCO2 decreases, pH rises, making the blood more basic (alkaline).
O2 saturation (O2Sat or SaO2)—the percentage of hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen. Hemoglobin is the protein in red bloods cells that carries oxygen through blood vessels to tissues throughout the body.
O2 content (O2CT or CaO2)—the amount of oxygen per 100 mL of blood.
Bicarbonate (HCO3-)—the main form of CO2 in the body. It can be calculated from the pH and PaCO2. It is a measurement of the metabolic component of the acid-base balance. HCO3- is released and reabsorbed by the kidneys in response to pH imbalances and is directly related to the pH level. As the amount of HCO3- rises in the blood, so does the pH (becomes alkaline)."

A variety of parasites can cause infections of the digestive system (gastrointestinal (GI) infections). When you have a parasite infecting your lower digestive tract, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, the parasites and their eggs (ova) are shed from your lower digestive tract into your stool.
For the exam, thin smears of your fresh or preserved stool are put onto glass slides and stained. The parasites and/or their ova or cysts (the form in which the parasite is surrounded by a resistant cover or capsule) may be seen and identified using a microscope. Different ova and parasites have distinct shapes, sizes, and internal structures that are characteristic of their species.
There are a wide variety of parasites that can infect humans. Each type of parasite has a specific life cycle and maturation process and may live in one or more hosts. Some parasites spend part of their life in an intermediate host, such as a sheep, before infecting humans. Some infect humans ""by accident."" There are parasites that are a single cell while others are worms (helminths). Most parasites have more than one form through which they develop. Many have a mature form and a cyst and/or egg (ova) form. Some also have a larval phase, which is between the egg and the mature form. Ova are hardy and can exist for some time in the environment without living in a host and remain infectious.
Most people who are infected by gastrointestinal parasites become infected by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated with the ova. (For more details, read Food and Waterborne Illness.) Ova and parasites from infected people or animals are released in the stool and can then contaminate any water, food, or surfaces that come into contact with them. This contamination cannot be seen. The food and water will look, smell, and taste completely normal. If you eat contaminated food or drink contaminated water, you can become infected. Without careful sanitation (hand washing and care with food preparation), you can pass the infection to others.
The most common symptoms of a parasitic infection are prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, mucus in your stool, abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms typically arise days to weeks after infection and can continue for some time. You may also have headaches and fever, or few or no noticeable symptoms.
If your diarrhea lasts more than a few days, it may lead to weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. These complications are especially dangerous in children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems (e.g., people with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and transplant recipients). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), foodborne and waterborne diarrheal diseases, including those caused by parasites, kill more than 700,000 people a year.
The three most common parasites in the United States are the single-cell parasites Giardia species, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium species. These parasites may infect swimming pools, hot tubs, and occasionally community water supplies and can be found throughout the world in even the most remote and pristine mountain streams and lakes. Giardia species are some of the most common intestinal parasites in the U.S.
Cryptosporidium (often called crypto) is one of the leading causes of recreational water-related disease outbreaks in the U.S.
Entamoeba histolytica is common but only causes illness in about 10% to 20% of those infected. In many cases, Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts can survive in water for weeks or months and are resistant to low levels of chlorine. The number of those infected with these parasites tends to increase during the summer months when more people are pursuing outdoor activities such as backpacking, hiking, and swimming and they drink untreated water or contaminated food.
If you travel outside the U.S., especially to resource-limited nations, you may be exposed to a much wider variety of parasites. In warm climates and places where water and sewage treatment are less effective, parasites are more prevalent. Besides Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and E. histolytica, there are also a wide range of flat worms, roundworms, hookworms, and flukes that can affect the digestive tract and other parts of the body. As a visitor, you would usually become infected by eating or drinking something that has been contaminated with the parasites' ova, even something as simple as ice cubes in a drink or a fresh salad, but some of the tiny worm-like parasites can also penetrate the skin, such as through the skin of your foot when you are walking barefoot.
If your illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, your healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if your symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in your stool, or if it persists, then a stool culture may be ordered. This is especially true if you have been outside the U.S. and/or have eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to you ill.
To aid diagnosis, an ova and parasite exam may be done along with or following a GI pathogens panel that simultaneously tests for multiple disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Other tests that may be done include a stool culture and antigen tests to identify specific microbes."

They are often used to relieve pain and inflammation, to reduce fever, and to prevent excessive blood clotting. Salicylate testing measures the concentration in the blood to detect and/or monitor an overdose (salicylate poisoning).
Salicylates are available as pills or tablets taken by mouth or as topical creams absorbed through the skin. Aspirin is the most common salicylate taken as tablets or pills. Over-the-counter salicylates are used as needed or regularly to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.
Low doses of aspirin may be taken on a regular basis to reduce the chance of inappropriate blood clotting (thrombosis), heart attack, or stroke in people who have a high risk of developing these disorders. Low-dose aspirin may also be used to prevent worsening of cardiovascular disease and/or complications in someone who is having a heart attack or who recently experienced one. However, aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention is no longer recommended in patients 70 or older, or those with bleeding disorders.
Aspirin is also used in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia) to prevent blood clot formation.
Uncommonly, prescription-strength aspirin may be used to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis as well as symptoms of autoimmune disorders such as lupus. With single, normal doses, blood concentrations of salicylates typically peak in about 2 hours, but this may be delayed for 12 hours or more with ""enteric-coated"" or ""sustained-release"" preparations. If too much salicylate is consumed (acute poisoning with a large dose) or too much is taken over time (chronic poisoning), then associated signs and symptoms will develop.
Salicylates are metabolized by the liver and eliminated from the body in the urine. The ability to remove salicylates efficiently is affected by the body's blood and urine pH (acidity/alkalinity) and by kidney and liver function. People with impaired liver or kidney function may be more susceptible to salicylate toxicity.
Salicylate poisoning is a serious condition that often requires hospitalization and careful monitoring. In severe cases, the acid-base imbalance that it causes can worsen over time, causing electrolyte imbalances (hyperkalemia), low blood glucose, and dehydration, and leading to convulsions, hallucinations, delirium, coma and even death.
Both acute and chronic toxicity will present with similar symptoms, but chronic toxicity is associated with lower levels of salicylate. In addition, chronic toxicity is more likely to occur in the elderly, causing delirium, lack of energy, fluid build-up in the lungs (pulmonary edema), kidney failure, acid-base disorders, and/or abnormal electrolytes. Many of these symptoms are already present in elderly patients not taking salicylates, so detecting salicylate overdose/poisoning can be difficult.
When used with care and following dosing directions, therapeutic doses of salicylates are safe and effective for most adults. However, adults can run into trouble with salicylates when they unknowingly combine multiple products that contain them. Many over-the-counter medications include a salicylate as one of the ingredients. If you are unaware of the ingredients, you can mistakenly take more than one of these drugs together, resulting in a cumulative effect and a high amount of ingested salicylate.
Widespread and easy availability of salicylate-containing medications can also mislead some to think that it is very safe and that ""more is better.""
An overdose can occur when you have pain that is not relieved with an initial dose and, unaware of the danger, take more than the recommended dose and/or take additional doses too soon.
In the elderly, these scenarios can especially be a problem because underlying conditions and general health status can decrease the ability to eliminate salicylates from the body. Aspirin is not recommended for use in children and teens because of the risk of developing Reye syndrome, a disease characterized by acute brain damage, resulting in changes in behavior, nausea, vomiting, and liver dysfunction that can be fatal. Though youth are not routinely given aspirin, they may become poisoned through accidental or intentional ingestion. Topical creams that contain salicylates are of special concern as they contain very high doses."

These are cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system. They are found in organs throughout the body. This test measures the amount of chromogranin A in the blood.
Neuroendocrine cells, and the endocrine glands that they are found in, can give rise to a variety of tumors, both benign and malignant. Examples include carcinoid tumors, insulinomas, small cell lung cancers, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, some pituitary tumors, and neuroblastomas. The CgA test may be used to aid in detection, diagnosis, or monitoring response to treatment or relapse of neuroendocrine tumors, especially carcinoid tumors.
Many of these tumors release large quantities of the hormone associated with that tissue, either continuously or intermittently, causing symptoms characteristic for that tumor. However, not all neuroendocrine tumors release expected hormones. In either case, neuroendocrine tumors are frequently associated with increased concentrations of CgA.
Carcinoid tumors, a subset of neuroendocrine tumors, are slow-growing noncancerous or cancerous masses. These form mainly in the digestive tract (stomach, pancreas, small intestine, colon, appendix, rectum) or the lungs. According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors and 2,000 to 4,500 lung carcinoid tumors newly diagnosed each year in the United States.
When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs."

They may be present in small quantities in the blood of some healthy people but are most frequently associated with abnormal protein production and a variety of diseases and conditions. This test detects and measures the relative quantity of cryoglobulins in the blood.
Precipitated cryoglobulins can slow the flow of blood and block small blood vessels. The presence of large amounts of cryoglobulins in the blood, called cryoglobulinemia, can cause symptoms such as bruising, rashes, joint pain, weakness, and Raynaud phenomenon – pain, paleness, bluing, numbness, tingling and coldness in the fingers and toes with exposure to cold. (These symptoms can also occur in people who do not have cryoglobulinemia.) Cryoglobulins can cause tissue damage that leads to skin ulcers and, in severe cases, to gangrene. They can activate the immune system, leading to the deposit of immune complexes in tissues, and cause inflammation, bleeding, and clotting that can affect circulation in organs such as the kidneys and liver.
There are three types of cryoglobulinemia: Type I, which consists of a monoclonal immunoglobulin – a single type of protein that is produced by an abnormal cloned cell. This type is often seen in people with myeloma or lymphoma.
Type II, which consists of a mixture of monoclonal and polyclonal immunoglobulins. This type is often seen in people with hepatitis C or other viral infections.
Type III, which consists of polyclonal immunoglobulins. This type is often seen in people with autoimmune diseases. Initial testing does not distinguish between these three types of cryoglobulins, but the proteins involved can be determined through subsequent protein electrophoresis testing."

This information can be helpful in diagnosing a T-cell lymphoma.
T-cells are a type of lymphocyte (a kind of white blood cell, WBC) that helps to protect the body from infection. Rearrangements in certain parts of their DNA called receptor genes are a normal part of their development. These rearrangements are associated with the development of a large repertoire of diverse T-cells, allowing them to protect against many different kinds of infections. The final order in which the genes are rearranged is called a gene rearrangement profile. Within any normal population (sample) of T-cells, the cells and their gene rearrangement profiles are very diverse.
In lymphoma, the T-cells in affected tissue (such as blood, lymph node, or skin) are identical and their gene rearrangement profiles are likewise identical. Lymphomas arise when an abnormal T-cell begins to produce numerous identical copies of itself (clones). The cloned cells grow and divide uncontrollably, crowding out normal cells.
A T-cell receptor gene rearrangement test evaluates the T-cells in a person's sample to determine whether the majority of T-cell rearrangement profiles are diverse or identical. This information, along with clinical signs and symptoms and results of other laboratory tests, can help clarify a person's diagnosis, or evaluate for persistent, residual, or recurrent lymphoma.
Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the U.S. are B-cell lymphomas (about 85%), according to the American Cancer Society. Close to 15% are T-cell lymphomas. There are many different types of T-cell lymphomas, but each is rare.

Avoid lubricants, lotions, soaps, and douches at least a day before the test."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/fetal-fibronectin-ffn,Fetal Fibronectin (fFN),['fFN'],[],"April 17, 2018.","November 22, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is a protein produced at the boundary between the amniotic sac (which surrounds the baby) and the lining of the mother's uterus (the decidua). Fetal fibronectin is largely confined to this junction and is thought to help ""glue"" or maintain the integrity of the boundary between the amniotic sac and the lining of the uterus. A fetal fibronectin test detects fFN in vaginal fluid to help predict the short-term risk of premature delivery.
According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a normal pregnancy is about 40 weeks, with a woman going into labor between 37 and 42 weeks. A preterm delivery is one that occurs between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy.
fFN is found in vaginal fluids early in pregnancy because of the normal growth and establishment of tissues at the junction between the amniotic sac and uterus, with levels falling when this phase is complete. fFN is also found in fluids from the vagina after 36 weeks when it is often released into vaginal fluids as the body gets ready for childbirth.
However, fFN should not be detectible between 22 and 35 weeks of pregnancy. Elevated levels during this period reflect a disturbance at the junction between the amniotic sac and the lining of the uterus. Elevated fFN in vaginal fluids during these weeks of pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor and delivery. Many pregnant women experience symptoms that suggest preterm labor. These may include uterine contractions, changes in vaginal discharge, backaches, abdominal discomfort, pelvic pressure, cramping, and dilation of the cervix. However, not all symptomatic women will actually have a preterm delivery. The majority will go on to deliver at term.
Unfortunately, while premature births can have successful endings, serious complications are possible when a baby leaves the womb early. Premature babies frequently have difficulty breathing and feeding. Their lungs and other organs are immature and do not function normally, and the strain on them can cause persistent health problems. The more premature the newborn, the more likely it is that he or she will experience complications.
If a healthcare practitioner thinks that a woman might deliver early, she will consider treatments designed to delay delivery. These treatments can have unwanted side effects, however, so knowing whether or not a woman is likely to deliver prematurely helps in the decision on the best course of action. The fFN test is a relatively noninvasive tool that can help distinguish between those women who are likely to deliver shortly and those who are not."

This makes the test useful as a tumor marker in specific circumstances. The HE4 test measures the amount of human epididymis protein 4 in the blood.
Significantly elevated concentrations of HE4 are frequently present in the blood of a woman who has epithelial ovarian cancer. When HE4 is increased, the HE4 test may be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and/or for recurrence or progression of the cancer.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the lifetime risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 75 and the lifetime risk of death is 1 in 100. ACS estimates that about 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the U.S. and about 14,000 women die of it.
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer. It originates in cells that cover the outside of the ovaries and accounts for 85% to 90% of ovarian cancers.
There are several different subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, including: serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell, with serous being the most common. Some studies have shown that HE4 is elevated in more than 90% of serous and endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancers and about 50% of clear cell tumors, but it is not usually elevated in mucinous cancers. Therefore, HE4 is not used for monitoring of patients with other types of ovarian cancer, such as mucinous or germ cell tumors.
Currently, there is no reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women. Less than 20% of ovarian cancers are found in the early stages before they have spread outside the ovary. One reason they go undetected is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly non-specific. The need for a reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women continues to drive ongoing research. In the meantime, regular physicals, pelvic exams, and an awareness of family history and symptoms are important. (For more information, see the article on Ovarian Cancer.)"

CD4 tests measure the number of these cells in the blood and, in conjunction with an HIV viral load test, help assess disease status in a person who has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
CD4 cells are made in the thymus gland and they circulate throughout the body in the blood and lymphatic system. They are so called because they have markers on their surfaces called clusters of differentiation (CD). The CD number identifies the specific type of cell.
CD4 cells are sometimes called T-helper cells. They help to identify, attack, and destroy specific bacteria, fungi, and viruses that cause infections. CD4 cells are also a major target for HIV, which binds to the surface of CD4 cells, enters them, and either replicates immediately, killing the cells in the process, or remains in a resting state, replicating later.
If HIV goes untreated, the virus gets into the cells and replicates, the viral load increases, and the number of CD4 cells in the blood gradually declines. The CD4 count decreases as the disease progresses. If left untreated, this process may continue for several years until the number of CD4 cells drops to a low enough level that symptoms associated with AIDS begin to appear.
Treatment for HIV infection, called antiretroviral treatment (ART or ARV) or sometimes highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), typically involves taking a combination of drugs. This treatment reduces the amount of HIV (viral load) present in the body and reduces the risk of disease progression. When this occurs, the CD4 count will increase and/or stabilize.
CD4 counts can be variable, even in healthy individuals. To provide a clearer picture of the condition of the immune system, test results may also be reported as a CD4 percentage, which is the ratio of CD4 cells to total lymphocytes.
CD4 tests may be used occasionally in other conditions, such as lymphomas and organ transplantation (see Common Questions below)."

This test measures the level of ZPP in the blood.
To understand how lead poisoning and iron deficiency affect the ZPP level, it is necessary to know about heme. Heme is an essential component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and cells.
Heme formation occurs in a series of steps that concludes with the insertion of an iron atom into the center of a molecule called protoporphyrin. When there is not enough iron available, as in iron deficiency, or when the insertion of iron is inhibited, as in lead poisoning, then protoporphyrin combines with zinc instead of iron to form zinc protoporphyrin. ZPP serves no useful purpose in red blood cells since it cannot bind to oxygen.
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) accumulates in red blood cells when there is insufficient iron present for proper heme synthesis. A small percentage of EP may be unbound and can be measured as free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), with the remainder EP (about 90%) measured as zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)."

The thyroid gland produces hormones (thyroxine or T4 and triiodothyronine or T3) that help to regulate the rate at which the body uses energy. It is a small, butterfly-shaped organ that lies flat against the windpipe at the base of the throat and is composed primarily of very small, ball-shaped structures called follicles that produce and store thyroglobulin.
Thyroglobulin serves as the source of T4 and T3. The production of these hormones and their release into the bloodstream are stimulated by the pituitary hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone).
Thyroglobulin is produced in all healthy individuals, and normally its level in blood is low. Thyroglobulin levels increase in both benign (Graves disease, subacute thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis) and thyroid cancer. Therefore, it is on one hand a non-specific indicator of a thyroid dysfunction and, on the other hand, a tumor marker that can be used to monitor patients with thyroid papillary and follicular cancer after diagnosis (see the Thyroid Cancer article)."

Although it is considered a ""male"" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. However, testosterone levels are normally much higher in men than in women. This test measures the level of testosterone in your blood. It is measured as total testosterone, either alone or in combination with free testosterone and/or bioavailable testosterone.
Testosterone is mainly produced by the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both males and females and, in small amounts, by the ovaries in females. In males, testosterone stimulates development of secondary sex characteristics, including enlargement of the penis, growth of body hair, muscle development, and a deepening voice. It is present in large amounts in males during puberty and adulthood to regulate the sex drive and maintain muscle mass.
In women, most testosterone is converted to estradiol, the main sex hormone in females. Testosterone production is stimulated and controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH), which is made by the pituitary gland. Testosterone works within a negative feedback loop: A low level of testosterone causes increased production of LH, which in turn stimulates testosterone production.
As the testosterone level increases, LH production decreases, which slows testosterone production. Testosterone levels are diurnal, with the highest (peak) levels occurring in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am) and the lowest levels occurring in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and decrease with age.
About two-thirds of testosterone circulates in your blood bound to the protein sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and slightly less than one-third is bound to the protein albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood. A small percent (less than 4%) circulates as free (not bound to protein) testosterone. Free testosterone plus the testosterone that is bound to albumin is the testosterone that can act on target tissues. This is called bioavailable testosterone.
In many cases, measurement of total testosterone provides a healthcare practitioner with adequate information. However, in certain cases, for example when the level of SHBG is abnormal, a test for free or bioavailable testosterone may be performed as it may more accurately reflect the presence of a medical condition."

DNA contains the instructions that allow cells to function and enable all bodily processes. Those instructions are provided by genes, which are collections of bases within DNA. It is believed that humans have 20,000 to 25,000 genes, each of which is made up of between a few hundred and two million bases.
Most of your DNA and genes come from your biological parents. Your full set of inherited DNA is known as your genome. More than 99% of the human genome is identical in every person.
Hereditary DNA is found in all the cells in your body. During your life, individual cells can experience changes, known as somatic mutations, that can alter DNA. However, these mutations only affect the DNA in those specific cells. They do not change your hereditary DNA.
Because DNA determines how the cells in your body work, it is fundamental in understanding both health and disease. Variants (mutations) in genes can heighten the risk of health problems and affect how your body responds to medications.
In addition, since DNA is unique to every individual — except for identical twins, who share the same DNA — it can be used for identification, and since it is hereditary, it can help demonstrate ancestry and family relationships."

Studies have suggested that a persistent low level of inflammation plays a major role in atherosclerosis, the narrowing of blood vessels due to build-up of cholesterol and other lipids, which is often associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The hs-CRP test accurately measures low levels of CRP to identify low but persistent levels of inflammation and thus helps predict a person's risk of developing CVD.
There are two different tests that measure CRP and each test measures a different range of CRP level in the blood for different purposes: The standard CRP test measures markedly high levels of the protein to detect diseases that cause significant inflammation. It measures CRP in the range from 10 to 1000 mg/L. This test may be used to detect inflammation (see the article C-Reactive Protein).
The hs-CRP test accurately detects lower levels of the protein than the standard CRP test. It measures CRP in the range from 0.5 to 10 mg/L. This test is used to evaluate individuals for risk of CVD. CVD causes more deaths in the U.S. each year than any other cause, according to the American Heart Association. A number of risk factors, such as family history, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, being overweight or diabetic, have been linked to the development of CVD, but a significant number of people who have few or no identified risk factors will also develop CVD. This fact has lead researchers to look for additional risk factors that might be either causing CVD or that could be used to determine lifestyle changes and/or treatments that could reduce a person's risk.
High-sensitivity CRP is one of a growing number of cardiac risk markers that are used to help determine a person's risk. Some studies have shown that measuring CRP with a highly sensitive assay can help identify the risk level for CVD in apparently healthy people. This more sensitive test can measure CRP levels that are within the higher end of the reference range. These normal but slightly high levels of CRP in otherwise healthy individuals can predict the future risk of a heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death, and peripheral arterial disease, even when cholesterol levels are within an acceptable range.
hs-CRP could be a marker not only in apparently healthy people, recent studies have shown. Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) with elevated CRP have worse functional status and exercise capacity, greater risk for death, or non-elective cardiovascular hospitalization."

Emergency and overdose drug testing is ordered for single drugs or groups of drugs by an emergency room (ER) health practitioner to detect, evaluate, and monitor a drug overdose.
Drugs and related substances that are ingested or absorbed are typically broken down (metabolized) by the liver over a period of time and then eliminated from the body, primarily in the urine. The rate at which this happens depends on a number of factors ranging from age, weight, and sex to food intake and presence of underlying diseases. Moreover, the development of toxicity depends on the type of substance absorbed or ingested.
Some substances cause symptoms only if they are present in high concentrations or above therapeutic levels. Some common examples of these include: Acetaminophen—an ingredient in many over-the-counter preparations; it can cause significant liver damage if recommended doses are exceeded.
Aspirin (also known as salicylates)—at higher levels, it can cause an acid-base imbalance.
Therapeutic drugs—used to treat conditions such as heart failure and epilepsy Some substances can cause symptoms at both low and high concentrations depending on the user. Long-term users of drugs such as alcohol and illegal drugs (drugs of abuse) may be able to tolerate more drug than someone who is taking it for the first time.
Other substances are toxic at any concentration and some have toxic break-down products (metabolites). Examples include: Toxic alcohols, including methanol and isopropanol
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) Ingestion of a variety of other drugs and chemicals may cause acute toxicity. This article is limited to the drugs and a few other substances more commonly tested for in the clinical laboratory. Some of the various general categories of substances that may be tested are listed below:
Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications
Overdoses caused by prescription and OTC drugs may be due to: Ingestion of too much of a medication
Interaction of multiple drugs
A decrease in the body's ability to eliminate a drug and/or its metabolite; many drugs are processed by the liver; that is, the liver changes the drug into a different form, which is then eliminated from the body. If the liver or kidneys are not working properly, then the drug and/or its metabolite may build up in the body. A classic example of an OTC drug with a toxic metabolite is acetaminophen, a common pain reliever that is also a component of a variety of other OTC and prescription medicines. One of the metabolites of acetaminophen is toxic to the liver, but the liver is able to detoxify ""normal"" amounts of it. However, if someone takes more acetaminophen than the liver can process, then the toxic metabolite builds up, damaging the liver and, in some cases, causing liver failure.
Illegal drugs
Overdoses of illegal drugs can also occur. The illicit drugs encountered in the ER depend on their prevalence in the community and whether these substances cause acute symptoms alone or in combination with other substances. Some drugs of abuse are ""diverted"" prescription medications, such as oxycodone or amphetamine. Some drugs, such as marijuana and other cannabinoids, can linger in the body for days to weeks but rarely cause overdose symptoms. Other substances, such as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), can cause acute symptoms such as a loss of consciousness but are metabolized so rapidly that testing for them is rarely useful. For more on these, see the article on Drugs of Abuse Testing.
Household substances
There are a wide variety of household substances that may be abused or accidentally ingested. Those commonly involved in emergency drug testing include methanol, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol (antifreeze), which some people ingest as substitutes for ethanol, also known as grain alcohol. Other poisons, such as rodenticides, aerosol and cleaning products, insecticides, and heavy metals, can also have toxic effects.

It is a protein that promotes inflammation and fever when your body is fighting anything that the immune system perceives as foreign or ""non-self"", such as bacteria or viruses. Inflammation plays a role in helping the body to heal from an injury or infection. In healthy people, the immune response is regulated, so inflammation does not become excessive.
If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system fails to distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" and mistakenly targets your own cells and tissues in an autoimmune reaction. This attack can cause excess inflammation, leading to signs and symptoms that periodically flare up and die down. Some autoimmune complications are serious enough to require medical treatment and can result in progressive and/or permanent tissue damage.
TNF is typically elevated in inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as IBD and RA. TNF promotes inflammation, which can increase the severity, complications, and damage associated with these disorders. This makes TNF a good target for drug therapies to treat inflammatory autoimmune conditions.
TNF inhibitor therapy is prescribed to decrease inflammation and allow damaged tissues to heal. It can alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and help autoimmune disorders go into remission. TNF inhibitor therapy is primarily used when you have an active inflammatory autoimmune disorder, with moderate to severe symptoms, that is not responding well to other treatments. TNF inhibitor therapy usually involves an initial series of infusions (into your vein) or injections (under your skin), and then periodic infusions or injections every few weeks.
TNF inhibitors may be used to treat conditions such as: IBD (which includes Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)
RA
Psoriatic arthritis
Ankylosing spondylitis
Plaque psoriasis The first TNF inhibitor to be developed was infliximab, about 20 years ago. It is still being used, but other TNF inhibitors have been introduced, such as: Adalimumab
Certolizumab
Golimumab Not everyone is helped by TNF inhibitor therapy. As many as 30% of people will not respond at all (primary nonresponse). Up to 50% will need to discontinue therapy, either because they initially respond but then stop (secondary nonresponse) or because they have adverse events.
Nonresponse to therapy is thought to be caused by a variety of factors, including: There is not enough medication in your body to sustain a response. This can happen because the dose was not large enough or your body cleared the drug too quickly. This can occur both initially and after you have been receiving the medication for a while.
Your body develops antibodies against the TNF inhibitor (TNF inhibitor antibodies). This can occur at any time after the few weeks of starting therapy. The TNF inhibitor antibodies can make TNF inhibitor therapy less effective, for example by blocking the drug from binding to TNF. TNF inhibitor antibodies may be present in low levels that some studies suggest can be overcome by giving a higher dose of TNF inhibitor, or they may be present in sufficient quantity to prevent TNF inhibitor therapy from being effective.
No identified cause—the TNF inhibitor therapy is not effective for your condition, even if there is enough drug present and no TNF inhibitor antibody. Because some people do not respond to TNF inhibitor therapy, testing may be performed to determine the cause. This testing can include two separate tests: One test measures the level or activity of the TNF inhibitor that you are receiving to help determine whether the dose is adequate.
Another test detects and measures the quantity or neutralizing ability of the TNF inhibitor antibodies that may have developed and that make the treatment less effective. There are two ways the tests can be ordered. One way is that both tests can be done at the same time. The other way is the TNF inhibitor level or activity is measured first and then the TNF inhibitor antibody test is only performed if the TNF inhibitor level or activity is low (but not if it is high).
TNF inhibitor testing is considered therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) because it can help to tailor your dose, to ensure the medication is in your body long enough at a level that is effective in treating your condition."

This test measures the level of sodium in the blood and/or urine.
Electrolytes are minerals that carry a charge and exist in your body fluids. Sodium and other electrolytes such as potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate (or total CO2) help cells function normally and helps regulate the amount of fluid in the body. While sodium is present in all body fluids, it is found in the highest concentration in the blood and in the fluid outside of the body's cells. This extracellular sodium, as well as all body water, is regulated by the kidneys.
We get sodium in our diet, from table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl), and to some degree from most of the foods that we eat. Most people have an adequate intake of sodium. The body uses what it requires and the kidneys eliminate the rest in the urine. The body tries to keep the blood sodium within a very narrow range. It does this by: Producing hormones that can increase (natriuretic peptides) or decrease (aldosterone) the amount of sodium eliminated in urine
Producing a hormone that prevents water losses (antidiuretic hormone, ADH, sometimes called vasopressin)
Controlling thirst; even a 1% increase in blood sodium will make a person thirsty and cause that person to drink water, returning the sodium level to normal. When the level of sodium in the blood changes, the water content in the body also changes. These changes can be associated with too little fluid (dehydration) or with too much fluid (edema), often resulting in swelling in the legs."

A lipid panel measures the level of specific lipids in the blood.
Two important lipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, are transported in the blood by lipoproteins (also called lipoprotein particles). Each type of lipoprotein contains a combination of cholesterol, triglyceride, protein, and phospholipid molecules. The particles measured with a lipid panel are classified by their density into high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).
A lipid panel typically includes: Total cholesterol—measures all the cholesterol in all the lipoprotein particles
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)—measures the cholesterol in HDL particles; often called ""good cholesterol"" because HDL-C takes up excess cholesterol and carries it to the liver for removal.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)—calculates or measures the cholesterol in LDL particles; often called ""bad cholesterol"" because it deposits excess cholesterol in walls of blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis. Usually, the amount of LDL-C is calculated using the results of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides.
Triglycerides—measures all the triglycerides in all the lipoprotein particles; most is in the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Some other information may be reported as part of the lipid panel. These parameters are calculated from the results of the tests listed above. Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)—calculated from triglycerides/5; this formula is based on the typical composition of VLDL particles.
Non-HDL-C—calculated from total cholesterol minus HDL-C
Cholesterol/HDL ratio—calculated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C An extended profile (or advanced lipid testing) may also include low-density lipoprotein particle number or concentration (LDL-P). This test measures the number of LDL particles, rather than measuring the amount of LDL-cholesterol. It is thought that this value may more accurately reflect heart disease risk in certain people. (For more, see the article on LDL Particle Testing).
Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of these lipids is important in staying healthy. While the body produces the cholesterol needed to function properly, the source for some cholesterol is the diet. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increasing the risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
A high level of triglycerides in the blood is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood."

This test measures the amount of elastase in stool (feces) to help evaluate whether a person's pancreas is functioning properly.
The pancreas is an organ located in the abdomen that consists of two kinds of tissues: exocrine and endocrine. The exocrine pancreas is responsible for producing elastase along with other enzymes that are transported to the small intestine to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates as part of food digestion.
In the digestive tract, elastase is not broken down by other enzymes and is eventually eliminated from the body in the stool. Elastase can be detected and measured in the stool when a person's pancreas is functioning normally. The level in the stool is decreased when the exocrine tissues of the pancreas are not producing sufficient elastase and other digestive enzymes. This condition is called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs when the amount of enzymes released and transported to the small intestine is inadequate for proper food digestion and absorption of nutrients. Any condition that blocks the pancreatic ducts or damages or destroy the cells that produce elastase can cause pancreatic insufficiency. It is often seen in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and sometimes pancreatic cancer. In children, it is most frequently associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS)."

Sickle cell tests determine the presence and relative amount of hemoglobin S in a blood sample or detect mutations in the genes that produce hemoglobin to help diagnose sickle cell anemia and/or identify people with sickle cell trait.
Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that binds to oxygen in the lungs and carries it to tissues throughout the body. Typically, hemoglobin A (Hb A, adult hemoglobin) makes up most of the hemoglobin found in normal RBCs in adults, with small amounts of hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F. Before babies are born, they normally produce large amounts of hemoglobin F (Hb F, fetal hemoglobin), which is then replaced by Hb A as the predominant hemoglobin shortly after birth.
Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition, passed from parents to children. Inheriting mutations in the genes that code for the production of hemoglobin can lead to abnormal types of hemoglobin (variants), such as Hb S and hemoglobin C (Hb C). Hemoglobin Cis one of the more common hemoglobin variants and may cause no symptoms or mild illness. Sickle cell disease and anemia—a person who inherits two abnormal gene copies (alleles), one of which is a Hb S gene, has sickle cell disease (i.e., a person who has one Hb S gene copy and one Hb C gene copy has sickle cell disease.) A person who inherits two Hb S gene copies (one from each parent; homozygous) has sickle cell anemia, the most common and serious for of sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell trait (carrier)—a person who inherits one normal hemoglobin gene copy from one parent and a Hb S gene copy from the other parent (heterozygous) has sickle cell trait and is a sickle cell carrier. Carriers generally don't experience signs and symptoms associate with sickle cell disease but can pass the mutation to their children. Hb S can form crystals that change the shape of the RBC from a round disc to a characteristic sickle shape. This altered shape limits the RBC's ability to flow smoothly throughout the blood vessels in the body, limits the hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen to tissues, and decreases RBC lifespan from 120 days to about 10-20 days. A person with sickle cell disease (homozygous for Hb S) can become severely anemic because the body cannot produce RBCs as fast as they are destroyed. The affected person can suffer painful episodes and a variety of complications when sickled cells become lodged in and obstruct small blood vessels (vaso-occlusion)."

It rarely causes symptoms or problems in healthy adults but can cause infections and serious illness in newborns who become infected before or during labor and delivery. GBS screening identifies the presence of the bacteria in the vaginal/rectal area of a pregnant woman.
GBS can cause early-onset GBS disease that occurs within the first week after birth. Signs and symptoms in newborns include fever, difficulty with feeding and breathing, irritability or lethargy, and a blue tint to the skin. GBS can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is the most common cause of life-threatening infections in newborns.
Approximately 25% of pregnant women carry group B strep in their rectum or vagina. However, the number of infants with GBS disease has decreased significantly in recent years because of a concerted effort by healthcare practitioners to screen pregnant women for GBS late in their pregnancy and, when they are positive for GBS, to treat them with intravenous antibiotics (usually penicillin or ampicillin) during labor. This prevents or greatly decreases the risk of passing the bacteria to the newborn. Nevertheless, GBS disease remains the primary cause of early-onset sepsis, a serious and life-threatening infection in newborns.
Currently there is no vaccine available to prevent GBS, and treating all pregnant women with antibiotics is not practical. Screening for GBS and appropriate treatment continues to be the best means for preventing GBS disease in newborns."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cardiac-biomarkers,Cardiac Biomarkers,['Cardiac Markers'],[],"June 12, 2015.","March 24, 2021.",What are cardiac biomarkers?,"Cardiac biomarkers are substances that are released into the blood when the heart is damaged or stressed. Measurements of these biomarkers are used to help diagnose acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and cardiac ischemia, conditions associated with insufficient blood flow to the heart. Tests for cardiac biomarkers can also be used to help determine a person's risk of having these conditions or to help monitor and manage someone with suspected ACS and cardiac ischemia.
The root causes of both ACS and cardiac ischemia are usually the buildup of plaque in artery walls and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). This can result in severe narrowing of the arteries leading to the heart or a sudden blockage of blood flow through these coronary arteries. Cardiac ischemia is caused when the supply of blood reaching heart tissue is not enough to meet the heart's needs. When not enough blood gets to the heart, it can cause pain in the chest (angina), shortness of breath, sweating, and other symptoms. Typical angina occurs when the coronary arteries have been gradually narrowed over time. The pain starts when a person is active, making the heart work harder, and is quickly relieved by rest or by drugs that increase blood flow to the heart, such as nitroglycerine.
ACS is caused by rupture of a plaque that results from atherosclerosis. Plaque rupture causes blood clot (thrombus) formation in coronary arteries, which results in a sudden decrease in the amount of blood and oxygen reaching the heart. A sudden decrease in the supply of blood to the heart can cause prolonged chest pain called unstable angina, often occurring at rest or not relieved by rest or nitroglycerine.
When blood flow to the heart is blocked or significantly reduced for a longer period of time (usually for more than 30-60 minutes), it can cause heart cells to die and is called an acute myocardial infarction (AMI or heart attack). This leads to death of the affected portion of heart muscle with permanent damage and scarring of the heart and sometimes can cause sudden death by causing irregular heart contractions (arrhythmia). Unstable angina and AMI are together called acute coronary syndrome since they are both due to a very acute decrease in blood flow to the heart.
The symptoms of ACS and cardiac ischemia can vary greatly but frequently include chest pain, pressure, nausea, and/or shortness of breath. Though these symptoms are most often associated with heart attacks and angina, they may also be seen with non-heart-related conditions.
It is important to distinguish heart attacks from angina, heart failure, or other conditions that may have similar signs and symptoms because the treatments and monitoring requirements are different. Cardiac biomarker tests are ordered to help detect the presence of ACS and cardiac ischemia and to evaluate their severity. Increases in one or more cardiac biomarkers in the blood can identify people with ACS or cardiac ischemia, allowing rapid and accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of their condition.
For ACS, prompt medical intervention is crucial to prevent death and to minimize heart damage and future complications. Cardiac biomarker tests must be available to a health practitioner 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with a rapid turn-around-time. Some of the tests may be performed at the point of care (POC) – in the emergency department or at a person's bedside. Usually, multiple cardiac biomarker tests are done over several hours to ensure that a rise in blood levels is not missed and to estimate the severity of a heart attack."

Creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys, which filter almost all of it from the blood and release it into the urine. This test measures the amount of creatinine in the blood and/or urine.
Creatine is part of the cycle that produces energy needed to contract muscles. Both creatine and creatinine are produced by the body at a relatively constant rate. Since almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. The amount of creatinine you produce depends on your body size and your muscle mass. For this reason, creatinine levels are usually slightly higher in men than in women and children.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that are located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back. Within them are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a microscopic cluster of looping blood vessels, called glomerulus. The glomerulus allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells and larger molecules. Attached to each glomerulus is a tiny tube (tubule) that collects the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus and then reabsorbs what still can be used by the body. The remaining waste forms urine.
Results from a blood creatinine test may be used in combination with results from other tests, such as a 24-hour urine creatinine test, to calculate values that are used to evaluate kidney function."

These autoantibodies can affect the body's ability to regulate blood clotting in a way that is not well understood. This test detects the presence of cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.
Cardiolipins, and other related phospholipids, are lipid molecules that play an important role in the blood clotting process. Cardiolipin antibodies target cardiolipins and are associated with an increased risk of developing recurrent inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in veins and arteries, such as the deep veins of the legs (DVT) or the lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE). They may also be associated with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), recurrent miscarriages (especially in the second and third trimester), and with premature labor and pre-eclampsia.
Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. They are frequently detected with other antiphospholipid antibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1. They may also be detected temporarily in people with acute infections, HIV/AIDS, some cancers, with drug treatments (such as phenytoin, penicillin, and procainamide), and in the elderly.
When an individual has inappropriate blood clot formation, recurrent miscarriages, cardiolipin antibodies, and/or another antiphospholipid antibody, the person may be diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS can be primary or secondary. Primary APS is not necessarily associated with a related autoimmune disorder, while secondary APS is associated with an autoimmune disorder."

They are proteins produced by specific immune cells called plasma cells in response to bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms as well as exposures to other substances that are recognized by the body as ""non-self"" harmful antigens. This test measures the amount of immunoglobulins A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, IgM) in the blood and, in certain circumstances, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or saliva.
The first time a person is infected or otherwise exposed to a foreign substance (antigen), their immune system recognizes the microorganism or substance as ""non-self"" and stimulates plasma cells to produce specific immunoglobulin(s), also called antibodies, that can bind to and neutralize the threat. With subsequent exposures, the immune system ""remembers"" the antigen that was encountered, which allows for the rapid production of more antibodies and, in the case of microorganisms, helps prevent re-infection.
There are five classes of immunoglobulins and several subclasses. Each class represents a group of antibodies and has a slightly different role. Classes of immunoglobulins include: Immunoglobulin M (IgM) – IgM antibodies are produced as a body's first response to a new infection or to a new ""non-self"" antigen, providing short-term protection. They increase for several weeks and then decline as IgG production begins.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) – About 70-80% of the immunoglobulins in the blood are IgG. Specific IgG antibodies are produced during an initial infection or other antigen exposure, rising a few weeks after it begins, then decreasing and stabilizing. The body retains a catalog of IgG antibodies that can be rapidly reproduced whenever exposed to the same antigen. IgG antibodies form the basis of long-term protection against microorganisms. In those with a normal immune system, sufficient IgG is produced to prevent re-infection. Vaccinations use this process to prevent initial infections and add to the catalog of IgG antibodies, by exposing a person to a weakened, live microorganism or to an antigen that stimulates recognition of the microorganism. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that can pass through the placenta. The mother's IgG antibodies provide protection to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during its first few months of life. There are four subclasses of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) – IgA comprises about 15% of the total immunoglobulins in the blood but is also found in saliva, tears, respiratory and gastric secretions, and breast milk. IgA provides protection against infection in mucosal areas of the body such as the respiratory tract (sinus and lungs) and the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). When passed from mother to baby during breast-feeding, it helps protect the infant's gastrointestinal tract. Significant amounts of IgA are not produced by a baby until after 6 months of age so any IgA present in a baby's blood before then is from the mother's milk. There are two IgA subclasses: IgA1 and IgA2.
Immunoglobulin D (IgD) – the role of IgD is not completely understood and IgD is not routinely measured.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) – IgE is associated with allergies, allergic diseases, and with parasitic infections. It is almost always measured as part of an allergy testing blood panel but typically is not included as part of a quantitative immunoglobulins test. Immunoglobulins testing measures the total amount of each primary immunoglobulin class, IgA, IgM, and IgG, without distinguishing between subclasses. Separate testing can be performed to measure immunoglobulin subclasses and/or to detect and measure specific antibodies.
A variety of conditions can cause an increase (hypergammaglobulinemia) or decrease (hypogammaglobulinemia) in the production of immunoglobulins. Some cause an excess or deficiency of all classes of immunoglobulins while others affect only one class. Some of the conditions are passed from one generation to the next (inherited) and others are acquired."

Along with another hormone, progesterone, they help regulate the menstrual cycle, are involved in the growth of breasts and the uterus, and help maintain a healthy pregnancy. Though considered the main sex hormones for women, they are also found in men and play a role in bone metabolism and growth in both sexes. Estrogen tests measure one of three components: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), or estriol (E3) in the blood or urine. Estrone (E1) is directly converted from androstenedione (from the adrenal gland) or indirectly from other androgens. E1 can also be produced by the ovaries and placenta, testicles, and adipose (fat) tissues. E2 and E1 can be converted into each other as needed. E1 is the primary estrogen in men and in post-menopausal women.
Estradiol (E2) is primarily produced in the ovaries under stimulation of FSH and LH in pre-menopausal women and in the testicles in men. E2 is converted from E1 in post-menopausal women. It is the most potent estrogen and the one that is present in the highest concentration in non-pregnant, pre-menopausal women. E2 levels vary depending on a woman's age and reproductive status. They are a good marker of ovarian function.
Estriol (E3) is produced by the placenta, with concentrations rising throughout a woman's pregnancy. Increasing levels are an indication of the health of the pregnancy and developing baby. Estriol is part of the second trimester maternal serum screen, a test performed to evaluate fetal risk due to certain chromosomal abnormalities. Very low levels of E3 are present in non-pregnant women or men. Estrogen in Girls and Women
The types and amounts of estrogen normally present in a woman's blood will vary throughout her lifetime. Levels vary during each menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, and on a daily basis.
At Birth
Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are high but fall within a few days. Concentration levels are minimal during early childhood.
At Puberty
Concentrations of E2 and E1 begin to rise as puberty approaches. These estrogens are responsible for the development of breasts, uterine growth, and (with other hormones) the onset and regulation of menstruation. A moderate amount of E1 is present from puberty to menopause. This concentration will vary during the day but is otherwise relatively stable.
During Menstruation
The menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days long and consists of two phases, follicular phase (day 1-14) and luteal phase (day 15-28). During each cycle, estradiol (E2) and several other hormones normally rise and then fall in a specific sequence.
During Pregnancy
Estriol (E3) is the primary estrogen present during pregnancy. It is produced by the placenta, starts to rise in the eighth week of pregnancy, and continues to rise throughout the pregnancy. A sharp increase of E3 occurs approximately 4 weeks prior to the onset of labor. Estriol circulating in maternal blood is quickly cleared out of the body. Each measurement of estriol is a snapshot of what is happening with the placenta and fetus, but there is also natural daily variation in estriol concentrations.
E1 also rises during pregnancy, increasing as much as 10-fold between weeks 24 and 40. After delivery, E1 falls and E3 again becomes essentially undetectable.
During Menopause
Estrone (E1) is the primary estrogen present during menopause. E2 concentrations significantly decrease as ovarian production wanes and eventually stabilize at a low level.
Estrogen in Boys and Men
The types and amounts of estrogen normally present in a man's blood change, but they vary much less over time than a woman's and they are much lower."

This test measures the total amount of fructosamine (glycated protein) in the blood.
Glucose molecules will permanently combine with proteins in the blood in a process called glycation. These proteins include albumin, the principal protein in the fluid portion of blood (serum), as well as other serum proteins and hemoglobin, the major protein found inside red blood cells (RBCs). The more glucose that is present in the blood, the greater the amount of glycated proteins that are formed. These combined molecules persist for as long as the protein or RBC is present in the blood and provide a record of the average amount of glucose that has been present in the blood over that time period.
Since the lifespan of RBCs is about 120 days, glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) represents a measurement of the average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 months. Serum proteins are present in the blood for a shorter time, about 14 to 21 days, so glycated proteins, and the fructosamine test, reflect average glucose levels over 2 to 3 weeks.
Keeping blood glucose levels as close as possible to normal helps individuals with diabetes to avoid many of the complications and progressive damage associated with elevated glucose levels. Good diabetic control is achieved and maintained by daily (or even more frequent) self-monitoring of glucose levels in people treated with insulin and by occasional monitoring of the effectiveness of treatment using the A1c test or the fructosamine test."

A trend from a normal to a high fructosamine level may indicate that glucose control is not adequate. This, however, does not pinpoint the cause. A review and adjustment to diet and/or medication may be required to help get glucose under control. Illness and significant stress can also temporarily raise blood glucose levels so these factors may also be taken into account when interpreting results."

This test measures the amount of soluble transferrin receptors to help detect and evaluate iron deficiency and aid in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.
Iron is an essential nutrient absorbed from the diet. Transferrin is the main protein in the blood that binds to iron and carries it to tissues and cells throughout the body. About 80% of iron is transported to the bone marrow, where it is incorporated into the hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs), and the rest is mostly stored in other cells and tissues as ferritin and hemosiderin.
When transferrin binds to iron, they form a complex. These complexes bind to transferrin receptors found on the surface of cells and the iron is then transported into the cells. Transferrin receptors are cleaved from the surface of cells, enter the bloodstream, and become soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR).
The number of transferrin receptors found on the surface of cells correlates with the level of iron within cells. When the iron level drops, the cells produce more transferrin receptors. As more receptors are produced, more are cleaved from cell surfaces and enter the blood, increasing the level of soluble transferrin receptors. Thus, measuring the level of sTfR is one way of evaluating the amount of iron available in the body.
Red blood cells have a lifespan of about 120 days. Because of this, the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs. If there is insufficient iron taken in through the diet and/or increased iron loss (e.g., bleeding), iron reserve stored in the body is decreased. Over time, this can lead to iron deficiency, as the amount of iron stored in the body exhausts and the demand for iron exceeds the supply. As a result, fewer RBCs are produced and those newly formed RBCs are also smaller (microcytic) and contain less hemoglobin (hypochromic). This is a condition called iron deficiency anemia.
Usually, a ferritin test is used to evaluate the amount of iron reserve in the body and to help diagnose iron deficiency anemia. However, the ferritin level can be elevated when an individual has inflammation or a chronic disease, such as autoimmune disorders or some cancers. In these conditions, the ferritin test is not useful as it may falsely indicate adequacy in iron reserve and therefore a test for soluble transferrin receptors may be ordered."

In these cases, ferritin may not be a good measure of stored iron as it may falsely indicate adequacy in iron reserve.

This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of anti-LKM-1 (or antibody against CYP2D6) in the blood.
Autoimmune hepatitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver cirrhosis and, in some cases, to liver failure. It is hepatitis that is not due to another identifiable cause, such as a viral infection, exposure to a drug or toxin, a hereditary disorder, or alcohol abuse. Anyone can develop the disorder, but the majority of those affected are women.
There is general agreement that there are two main types of autoimmune hepatitis (debate continues as to whether there is a distinct third type). Type 1 is the most common form of autoimmune hepatitis in the United States and is associated with the presence of smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) in the blood. Type 2 is less common and tends to be more severe. It is associated with anti-LKM-1 antibodies and primarily affects young girls and is more common in Europe than in the United States."

This test measures the inhibin B level in the blood and may be used as part of an infertility evaluation.
Inhibin B is made mostly by the ovaries in females, and by the testicles in males. In women, inhibin B is associated with maturation of follicles in the ovaries. The follicles are the structures that develop into mature eggs. Inhibin B rises and falls at different times during each menstrual cycle.
In men, inhibin B plays a role in the production of sperm in the testicles. Inhibin B levels are typically higher in men with normal fertility compared to men who do not produce an adequate number of viable sperm. These roles allow inhibin B tests to be used as a marker of remaining fertility and ovarian function in women. Less commonly, it can be used to assess fertility in men.
Women are born with a fixed number of follicles within the ovaries that can mature to become eggs. This maturation process occurs during each of your menstrual cycles. As you age, you have fewer viable follicles and so produce fewer mature eggs. Over time, the quality of the eggs decreases as well, and they are more likely to have chromosome imbalances. Levels of inhibin B and another hormone called anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) correlate with the number of follicles you have remaining, so they are a general indicator of remaining fertility (ovarian reserve). If you are going to have assisted reproductive procedures such as in-vitro fertilization, then inhibin B and AMH levels are related to your likely responsiveness to treatment."

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a protein produced first by the growing placenta. During a normal pregnancy, levels of this protein increase in the pregnant woman's blood until delivery.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy in large quantities by the placenta. Either free beta subunit or total hCG can be used in first trimester screening. Levels of both usually rise rapidly in the pregnant woman's blood for the first 8 to 10 weeks, then decrease and stabilize at a lower level for the remainder of the pregnancy.
Nuchal translucency is measurement made by ultrasound. The ultrasonagrapher measures the fluid collection between the spine and the skin at the nape of the fetus's neck. It is a procedure that requires a specially trained radiologist, proper alignment of the fetus, and careful measurement. It is not a routine ultrasound, and it is not a procedure that is available at every hospital or health facility. If the results of first trimester screening are cause for concern, diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may be recommended."

The risk of having a child with Down syndrome or other chromosomal abnormality increases with the age of the mother. Although the risk of having an affected baby is significantly greater in those older than 35, the majority of Down syndrome babies (about 80%) are born to those under 35 because this age group has the greatest number of children. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that all pregnant women be offered a screening test for Down syndrome."

This test measures the amount of trypsinogen in the blood.
Normally, trypsinogen is produced in the pancreas and transported to the small intestine. In the small intestine, it is activated and converted to trypsin. Trypsin is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down the protein in food into smaller pieces called peptides. Without sufficient trypsinogen and trypsin, a person will not be able to properly digest and use proteins. Any condition that prevents trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine may cause an increase in trypsinogen in the blood.
In people with cystic fibrosis (CF), mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, preventing trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine, resulting in decreased breakdown of food proteins.
Damage to the pancreas caused by other diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, may also cause blockages that prevent trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine. The cells that produce trypsinogen can also become damaged or be destroyed, decreasing the body's supply.
As part of a group of newborn screening tests, infants may be screened for CF using a test called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). Newborns with CF may have elevated levels of IRT."

They may exist as part of the normal flora found in the throat, upper respiratory tract, and genitourinary tract. Mycoplasmas are unlike other types of bacteria in many ways and can be difficult to culture and identify. Mycoplasma testing is used to determine whether someone currently has or recently had a mycoplasma infection.
Mycoplasma testing includes a group of tests that either measure antibodies in the blood produced in response to a mycoplasma infection or detect the microbe directly through culturing or by detecting its genetic material (DNA) in a body sample. It is most often used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), the causative agent of respiratory infections often referred to as ""atypical pneumonia.""
M. pneumoniae is a common cause of upper respiratory infections, with an estimated 2 million cases in the U.S. each year. It is responsible for 15-20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, appearing as single cases and as periodic epidemics, especially in school-age children and in military populations or other settings where people live in close quarters. Infections can occur at any time of the year, but outbreaks are more prevalent in the late summer and early fall.
Most cases of M. pneumoniae infection are mild and self-limited, causing nonspecific symptoms such as bronchitis, a runny nose, and a nonproductive cough that may persist for several weeks. Symptoms may become more severe, causing fever, sore throat, headaches, and muscle aches, when the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract and causes ""walking pneumonia,"" or, more rarely, spreads to other parts of the body. This is especially true in very young infants, in those who have underlying health conditions, such as asthma, or who have compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Depending upon what parts of the body become infected, complications may range from meningitis to difficulty breathing, cardiac inflammation and arrhythmia, skin rashes, lesions or nodules, arthritis, anemia, or to Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Testing may occasionally be done to detect other species of mycoplasma. Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections are less common than those seen with M. pneumoniae. In adults, these organisms are primarily sexually transmitted, causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and some inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) in men and sometimes associated with vaginal discharge and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women. M. hominis and U. urealyticum can be passed from mother to baby during birth when the baby passes through an infected birth canal. They typically colonize infants for their first couple of years. Rarely, they can cause systemic infections in infants and in those with compromised immune systems."

If a systemic infection is being diagnosed, blood, joint fluid, body fluids, or tissues samples may be cultured. Some samples may require a special procedure to collect them.

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/therapeutic-drug-monitoring,Therapeutic Drug Monitoring,['TDM'],[],"October 23, 2018.","November 30, 2020.",What is therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)?,"Therapeutic drug monitoring is the measurement of specific drugs and/or their breakdown products (metabolites) at timed intervals to maintain a relatively constant concentration of the medication in the blood. Some of the monitored drugs tend to have a narrow ""therapeutic index,"" which is a ratio between the toxic and therapeutic (effective) dose of medication.
As soon as a drug enters the body, different processes start removing the drug from the body. The amount of time it takes for the body to reduce the drug concentration to half from the initial value is called a half-life of the drug. It generally takes around five half-lives to remove a drug completely from the body.
Generally, a person must be given a drug dose at regular intervals to ensure that the effective or the therapeutic concentration of the drug is maintained in the body. For some drugs, maintaining this steady state is not as simple as giving a standard dose of medication. Each person will absorb, metabolize, utilize and eliminate drugs at different rates based upon their age, general state of health and genetic makeup. The drug concentration in the body may be enhanced or decreased by the interference of other medications that you may be taking along with the drug which has to be motioned. This is also known as drug-drug interaction.
Not all medications require therapeutic monitoring. Most drugs have a wide therapeutic index and can be prescribed based upon pre-established dosing schedules. The effectiveness of these treatments has been evaluated, but monitoring the concentration of the drug in the blood is not required for dosing. Examples of drugs that do not require monitoring include high blood pressure (hypertension) medications and many of the antibiotics given to treat bacterial infections. If an infection resolves with a given antibiotic or if blood pressure is lowered with the prescribed blood pressure medication, then the treatments have been effective."

They must be maintained at steady concentrations year after year while the person ages and goes through life events that may alter that individual's therapeutic level, including pregnancies, temporary illnesses, infections, emotional and physical stresses, accidents, and surgeries. Over time, people may acquire other chronic conditions that also require lifetime medication and that may affect the processing of their monitored drugs. Examples of these conditions include cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, thyroid disease, liver disease, and HIV."

These tests are used to monitor blood levels of drugs that have a narrow range in which the drug is effective but not toxic. In addition, some drugs require monitoring because the amount of drug given does not correlate well with the amount of drug that may reach the blood. Sometimes, the way that a drug is absorbed and metabolized can vary from person to person, or the physical or health status of a person can affect the drug level in the blood."

Once a person's results are in the therapeutic range and his or her clinical signs indicate that the treatment is appropriate, then the health practitioner may monitor the drug at regular intervals and as needed to accommodate changes in patient status and to ensure that the drug stays in the therapeutic range. The frequency of testing required will depend on the drug and on the needs of the patient. If treatment does not appear to be fully effective, or if the person has either excessive side effects or signs of toxicity, then the health practitioner will order testing aimed at adjusting the drug dosage and maintaining levels within the therapeutic range.

This test detects these autoantibodies in the blood of people with myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare but often severe autoimmune disease that causes muscle fatigue and weakness.
Muscle-specific kinases are proteins found where nerve endings and muscle fibers come together (neuromuscular junctions). Although the cause of MG is not fully understood, it is thought that the anti-MuSK antibodies interfere with the transmission of signals between nerves and muscles.
MG is typically first noticed when it causes weakness in eye muscles and symptoms such as drooping eyelid(s) and/or double vision. This is often referred to as ocular MG and about 15% of people with MG have ocular problems only. From the eye muscles, MG can spread over time to facial and neck muscles, causing weakness, slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and/or difficulty breathing. When muscle weakness spreads from the eyes to the head and neck and other parts of the body, the condition is called generalized MG. Muscle weakness will vary over time. The weakness tends to worsen during physically activity but improves with rest.
Most people with MG have antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR antibodies). However, about 10% to 15% of people with MG do not have AChR antibodies. In cases where AChR antibodies are not detected, a healthcare practitioner will likely order an anti-MuSK antibody test. Estimates of the proportion of people with MG who are negative for AChR antibodies but positive for antibodies to MuSK range from about 6% to 50%. This condition is sometimes called MuSK MG.
According to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, people with anti-MuSK antibodies are more likely to have the generalized form of myasthenia gravis, compared to ocular myasthenia gravis, which affects only the eyes and eyelids. Women are more often affected by autoimmune MuSK MG than men, and onset can occur at any age. People with MuSK MG may respond differently to certain treatments compared to those with AChR-positive MG."

It is not a diagnostic test, meaning it cannot tell for certain whether your baby is affected or unaffected. If NIPS shows an increased risk for a specific chromosome disorder, diagnostic testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis is recommended to establish the true diagnosis.
NIPS evaluates a type of genetic material called cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that is released by cells from the placenta and circulates in the mother's blood during pregnancy. The cfDNA from the placenta generally reflects the genetic makeup of the developing baby (fetus). NIPS detects chromosome disorders in placental cfDNA and can be performed as early as the 10th week of pregnancy.
Although there are many similarities among various versions of NIPS, laboratories may offer opt-in or opt-out choices for things like the sex chromosomes or microdeletions. It is important to speak to your healthcare practitioner about which test is being recommended for you. NIPS may screen for: The presence of extra chromosomes (trisomies) such as:
Down syndrome (trisomy 21)—Down syndrome is the most common of the three trisomies screened for by NIPS. While all individuals with Down syndrome share certain characteristics, the severity of these characteristics can vary quite broadly.
Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) are both less common than Down syndrome and typically much more severe. Many babies with Edwards or Patau syndrome do not survive to the first year.
Sex chromosome disorders—some people elect to have the sex chromosomes screened to learn the anticipated sex of their baby, but there are also sex chromosome disorders, such as Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and XXX syndrome that may be identified. For additional information on sex chromosome abnormalities (SCAs), please see the links in the Related Content section.
Microdeletion syndromes—although not recommended by professional guidelines, some laboratories also offer screening for a set of disorders caused by small missing segments of specific chromosomes, called microdeletion syndromes. When chromosomal segments are missing, differences in the amount of chromosomal information present alter the baby's development and cause the features of these disorders. With the exception of DiGeorge syndrome (also called deletion 22q11.2 syndrome), the other conditions are quite rare, and the test's ability to correctly identify microdeletions is unclear."

This test detects an HTLV infection in order to help identify the virus as the underlying cause of an individual's leukemia, lymphoma, rare nervous system disorder, chronic pulmonary infection, uveitis, infectious dermatitis, or other inflammatory disorder.
Two types of HTLV are most commonly identified through testing: HTLV-I and HTLV-II. It is estimated that 15-20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection is greatest in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean islands, and Central and South America. HTLV-II appears to be endemic among Native American populations and is prevalent among intravenous (IV) drug users in North America and Europe.
In the United States, about 22 out of every 100,000 people are infected with HTLV, with HTLV-II infection being more common than HTLV-I infection. HTLV-II infection is associated with female sex, older age, non-white race/ethnicity, lower educational level, and residence in the Western and Southwestern U.S. Some Native American Indian populations have infection rates as high as 13%. Those most likely to be infected with HTLV-I have immigrated to the U.S. from a country where HTLV-1 infection is prevalent, are children of such immigrants, are IV drug users, or are sex workers.
An HTLV-I infection can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Both HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections can be sexually transmitted or spread through exposure to contaminated blood as occurs with sharing of needles during IV drug use, although the majority of drug use-related infections are linked to HTLV-II. Both types may be passed through a blood transfusion or an organ transplant, but infection due to these procedures is now rare in the United States because all donors are tested for HTLV-I/II.
Other risk factors for HTLV infection include: living in parts of the world where HTLV is more common (such as those listed above); having a sexual partner who came from one of these areas; having multiple sex partners; being an IV drug user; being Native American Indian; or having a history of blood transfusions.
Both HTLV-I and HTLV-II preferentially infect T-lymphocytes. Most people infected with HTLV-I or HTLV–II will have few to no symptoms but can pass the infection on to others. After the initial infection, the virus never completely goes away but remains in the body in an inactive (latent) form. A small percentage of those infected go on to develop one of several associated diseases, typically months to many years or even decades after their initial exposure, and may then become acutely or chronically ill.
HTLV-I is associated with: Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a type of white blood cell cancer that may progress rapidly or slowly and cause symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes
HTLV-I–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a rare condition that can cause weakness in the lower limbs, muscle spasms, nerve pain, and urinary incontinence
In some cases, other conditions such as uveitis, HTLV-I–associated infective dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome HTLV-II is less clearly linked with specific diseases but may be associated with certain lung conditions, neurological disorders, arthritis, asthma, and dermatitis.
The body responds to an HTLV-I or HTLV-II infection by producing antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the blood during testing. The viruses may also be directly tested using molecular tests (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) that detect the genetic material of the viruses."

The level of the prescribed aminoglycoside in the blood is measured in order to adjust doses as necessary and ensure effective treatment while avoiding toxic side effects. (For more information about this, see the article on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.)
Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are the most commonly prescribed aminoglycosides, and they are used to treat infections caused by certain types of Gram-negative bacteria as well as a few Gram-positive bacteria. (For more on these, see the article on the Gram stain).
It is important to monitor the concentration of aminoglycosides because their effectiveness depends on having an adequate level in the blood. Aminoglycosides are associated with serious toxic side effects, including damage to hearing and/or balance (ototoxicity) and acute kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). Though kidney damage caused by aminoglycosides is usually reversible, hearing and/or balance loss is frequently permanent. These side effects can occur at any time, but the risk is greater with elevated blood levels and when the drugs are given for an extended period of time. The risk of side effects is lower with some of the aminoglycosides that have been developed recently.
Aminoglycosides are not well absorbed by the digestive system, so they are typically be administered either through a needle into a vein (intravenously, IV) or by injection into a muscle (intramuscularly, IM). Aminoglycosides can be given: Using dosing intervals (such as every 8-12 hours), or
As a large single dose once every 24 to 48 hours (also called extended-interval or pulse dosing). The amount of an aminoglycoside given per dose depends on a variety of factors, including kidney function, other drugs you may be taking, your age and weight.
When a dose of aminoglycosides is given, the level typically rises in the blood to a peak concentration and then falls over time to a lower (trough) concentration. Sometimes these drugs are prescribed using interval dosing, in which the subsequent dose is timed to be given in anticipation of the falling level. The goal is to dose a sufficient amount of drug to maintain a therapeutic level that will kill the bacteria causing the infection. The dose and the dosing interval are optimized to give the body enough time to clear most of the drug from the previous dose before the next dose is given. This minimizes the risk of complications and helps ensure that an adequate drug level is always maintained in the blood. For interval dosing, drug monitoring typically involves assessing the maximum concentration soon after a dose is given (called a peak level) and the minimum concentration just before the next dose is given (called a trough level). Depending on the measured concentration, the next dose of drug may be adjusted up or down. For example, you may not be able to clear the drug out of your system efficiently if you have kidney disease, resulting in an increased concentration in the blood, so the dose may be adjusted lower or the drug may be given less frequently. On the other hand, if you are given too little drug and have an insufficient level in the blood, it is unlikely that treatment will be effective.
For extended-interval dosing, testing may be performed similarly to interval dosing, using a peak sample and a sample taken 6-12 hours later, or testing can be performed on a single sample taken 6-14 hours after the first dose of antibiotic. Aminoglycosides are sometimes prescribed alone but are often combined with other antibiotics. Monitoring the antibiotic blood level is especially important in the presence of other medications, as they can affect the ability of the body to process (metabolize) and clear the drug."

Arbovirus testing detects either antibodies produced by the body's immune system in response to a specific arbovirus infection or it detects the virus's genetic material in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
Found throughout the world, arboviruses are an important cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis. In temperate climates, they tend to cause occasional seasonal epidemics. In tropical climates, they may be found year-round, whenever mosquitoes are active.
These viruses are spread when a mosquito, or sometimes another insect carrier (vector) such as a tick or sandfly, bites an infected bird or other small animal and becomes infected, then bites a human and passes it on. Arbovirus infections are usually not directly passed from person-to-person. Sometimes, an infection may be transmitted through a blood transfusion, organ transplant, sexual contact, from a pregnant woman to her baby, or from a mother to child through breast milk.
Arbovirus testing is used along with a person's signs, symptoms, and history of exposure and travel to detect and confirm an acute arbovirus infection and to distinguish between an infection and other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.
Depending on the virus causing the infection, people infected by an arbovirus may have only mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that resolve within a few days to a few weeks. In some cases, a sudden onset of high fever may be accompanied by a rash (dengue fever), jaundice (yellow fever), or severe joint pain and debilitating symptoms. Depending on the virus, a person may develop severe symptoms that may be life-threatening and require hospitalization.

Creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine. A creatinine clearance test measures creatinine levels in both a sample of blood and a sample of urine from a 24-hour urine collection. The results are used to calculate the amount of creatinine that has been cleared from the blood and passed into the urine. This calculation allows for a general evaluation of the amount of blood that is being filtered by the kidneys in a 24-hour time period.
The amount of creatinine produced in the body is dependent on muscle mass and is relatively constant for an individual. The amount of creatinine removed from the blood depends on both the filtering ability of the kidneys and the rate at which blood is carried to the kidneys.
The amount of blood filtered per minute by the kidneys is known as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). If the kidneys are damaged or diseased, or if blood circulation is slowed, then less creatinine will be removed from the blood and released into the urine and the GFR will be decreased.
GFR is difficult to measure directly. Therefore, it is recommended to estimate GFR by measuring the creatinine level in the blood and using the results in an equation to calculate estimated GFR. The calculation that takes into account several factors, such as age, gender and race of the person tested (see the article on Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate).
Another, less common way to estimate GFR is to calculate creatinine clearance. There are several versions of the creatinine clearance calculation. All of them include the measurement of the amount of creatinine in a blood sample collected just before or after the urine collection, the amount of creatinine in a 24-hour urine sample, and the 24-hour urine volume. Since the amount of creatinine produced depends on muscle mass, some calculations also use a correction factor that takes into account a person's body surface area (using their height and weight)."

In women, these hormones are made mostly by the ovaries and by the placenta during pregnancy. Additionally, inhibin A and/or B may be produced by certain types of ovarian tumors. In general, tumors are an uncontrolled growth of cells that may be benign (harmless) or cancerous. Inhibin A and inhibin B tests are two separate tests that measure the levels of these hormones in the blood.
Elevated levels of inhibin A and/or inhibin B may be present in the blood of a woman with a rare type of ovarian tumor called a granulosa cell tumor (the most common type of sex-cord stromal tumor). Blood levels of these hormones may also be elevated in some women with mucinous epithelial tumors. (For more details on these types of tumors, read the Ovarian Cancer article.) This makes inhibin A and B potentially useful as tumor markers. However, not all women with these ovarian tumors will have elevated inhibin A or B, so the tests may not be useful in all cases.
Most research on inhibin A and B as ovarian tumor markers have focused on postmenopausal women who normally have low to undetectable levels of these hormones. The use of these tumor markers in women of childbearing age (premenopausal) is less clear. Levels of inhibin A and B are usually higher in premenopausal women and the levels vary throughout their menstrual cycle. This can sometimes make it difficult to interpret results in premenopausal women."

This includes people who have had a blood clot or who have an excessive clotting disorder, atrial fibrillation, an artificial heart valve, or have undergone orthopedic surgery.
Warfarin sensitivity testing helps determine if you may be more sensitive (i.e., require lower doses) to treatment with warfarin because of your genetic makeup. This test primarily detects common genetic variations in two genes, CYP2C9 and VKORC1. A healthcare practitioner may sometimes order this test to help select appropriate doses of warfarin and/or to achieve appropriate dose levels more quickly.
Warfarin can be a challenging drug to administer and monitor because its levels can be affected by many different factors and it has a narrow window in which it is effective. If you are given too little drug, you may be at risk of forming a blood clot; if given too much drug, you may be at risk of moderate to severe bleeding episodes. The range between too much drug and too little drug is small and it varies significantly from person to person.
Historically, healthcare practitioners have given warfarin doses based upon age, weight, and sex, and then have monitored and adjusted dosages using frequent PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) tests to determine the medication's anticoagulant (""blood-thinning"") effect. Healthcare practitioners then use periodic PT/INR tests to ensure that a stable dose with sufficient anticoagulation has been achieved. Although this dosing strategy is still commonly used, it can take as long as several weeks.
Genetic testing for warfarin sensitivity may help to shorten the time it takes for you to reach a stable dose; that is, to achieve adequate ""blood-thinning"" without bleeding episodes. Most often, it is determined that people are more sensitive to warfarin and may need smaller doses; however, there are some people who are less sensitive and may need larger doses. The reason for the relative sensitivity can be, at least in part, due to the individual's genetic makeup and may involve two genes: The VKORC1 gene codes for the production of a protein (VKOR) that is involved in the production of functional forms of certain clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) that allows them to participate in the clotting process. Warfarin prevents the action of VKOR. Therefore, a variation in VKORC1 may cause you to be more or less sensitive (or resistant) to warfarin.
The CYP2C9 gene codes for the production of a protein (CYP2C9) involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of warfarin. People with CYP2C9 variations may not be able to get the drug out of their system as efficiently as others. The people who clear the drug more slowly may require lower (sometimes significantly lower) doses of warfarin. You inherit one copy of each of your genes from your mother and one copy of each of your genes from your father. Thus, each of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes is present in your body as two inherited gene copies (alleles). You could have both copies of a gene without any variants (wild-type, normal); one copy without variants and one copy with a variant (heterozygous); both copies with the same variant (homozygous); and both copies with different variants (""compound heterozygous""). The combination of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene copies that you have can determine the overall effect of warfarin and how rapidly it is metabolized and cleared from your body.
Warfarin sensitivity (or warfarin genotype) testing determines whether CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants are present. Careful interpretation of the results can help the healthcare practitioner decide the appropriate doses of warfarin for your treatment."

It comes into the body through the diet and is absorbed by the small intestine and colon. Magnesium is stored in the bones, cells, and tissues. Normally, only about 1% of total body magnesium is present in the blood and this makes it difficult to get an accurate measurement of total magnesium content from blood tests alone. However, this test is still useful for evaluating a person's magnesium status.
A wide variety of foods contain small amounts of magnesium, especially green vegetables such as spinach, as well as whole grains and nuts. Foods that have dietary fiber are usually also sources of magnesium. The body maintains its magnesium level by regulating how much it absorbs and how much it excretes or conserves in the kidneys.
Magnesium deficiencies (hypomagnesemia) may be seen with malnutrition, conditions that cause malabsorption, and with excess loss of magnesium by the kidneys. Magnesium excess (hypermagnesemia) may be seen with the ingestion of antacids that contain magnesium and with decreased ability of the kidneys to excrete magnesium.
Someone with mild to moderate magnesium deficiency may have no or few nonspecific symptoms. Persistent or severe deficiencies can cause nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, confusion, muscle cramps, seizures, changes in heart rate, and numbness or tingling. They can also affect calcium metabolism and exacerbate calcium deficiencies. Symptoms of excess magnesium can be similar to those of deficiency and include nausea, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, and an irregular heart rate."

The urine culture is a test that detects and identifies bacteria and yeast in the urine, which may be causing a urinary tract infection (UTI).
The kidneys, a pair of bean-shaped organs located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back, filter wastes out of the blood and produce urine, the yellow fluid that carries wastes out of the body. Urine travels through tubes called ureters from the kidneys to the bladder, where it is stored temporarily, and then through the urethra as it is voided. Urine contains low levels of microbes, such as bacteria or, yeast which move from the skin into the urinary tract and grow and multiply, causing a urinary tract infection.
Most UTIs are considered uncomplicated and are easily treated. However, if they are not addressed, the infection may spread from the bladder and ureters into the kidneys. A kidney infection is more dangerous and can lead to permanent kidney damage. In some cases, an untreated urinary tract infection may spread to the bloodstream (septicemia) and cause sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
Women and girls get urinary tract infections more often than men and boys. Even preteen girls may have frequent UTIs. For men and boys with a UTI confirmed by a urine culture, further tests may be done to rule out the presence of a kidney stone or structural abnormality that could cause the infection.
People with kidney disease or with other conditions that affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or kidney stones, and people with weakened immune systems may be more prone to frequent, repeated and/or complicated UTIs. For a urine culture, a small sample of urine is placed on one or more agar plates (a thin layer of a nutrient media) and incubated at body temperature. Any bacteria or yeast that are present in the urine sample grow over the next 24 to 48 hours.
A laboratory professional studies the colonies on the agar plate, counting the total number and determining how many types have grown. The size, shape, and color of these colonies help to identify which bacteria are present, and the number of colonies indicates the quantity of bacteria originally present in the urine sample. The quantity can differentiate between normal levels of bacteria versus infection.
Ideally, if a good clean catch sample was collected for the test, only bacteria causing a UTI are present. Typically, this will be a single type of bacteria that will be present in relatively large numbers.
Sometimes, more than one type of bacteria will be present. This may be due to an infection that involves more than one pathogen; however, it is more likely due to skin, vaginal, or fecal contamination picked up during the urine collection.
The laboratorian will take a colony from each type and perform other tests, such as a gram stain, to identify the type (species) of bacteria or other microbe (i.e., yeast). Susceptibility testing may be done to determine which antibiotics will likely cure the infection. If there is no or little growth on the agar after 24 to 48 hours of incubation, the urine culture is considered negative and the culture is complete, suggesting an infection is not present."

Women should then spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back using a wipe provided by your healthcare practitioner or the laboratory. It is recommended to repeat with a second towel or wipe.
Men should wipe the tip of the penis.
Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, and then collect one to two ounces of urine directly into the sterile container provided, then void the rest into the toilet. Do not allow the inside of the container to come into contact with skin and do not scoop the urine from the toilet (or any other container). For catheterized specimens, a urine sample is taken by inserting a thin flexible tube or catheter through the urethra into the bladder. This is performed by a trained healthcare practitioner. The urine is collected in a sterile container at the other end of the tube. Rarely, a needle and syringe may be used to collect by aspirating urine directly from the bladder.

The presence of these mutations may indicate that certain drugs will not be effective in treating the cancer.
KRAS is a short name for the gene Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog. It is one of a group of genes involved in a pathway called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This complex signaling pathway involves numerous components that relay signals from outside of the cell to within the cell to help regulate cell growth, division, survival and death.
In many normal cells, binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) on the surface of the cell is an important signal for cell growth and division. Other signals in the pathway involve a class of proteins called tyrosine kinase (TK) enzymes and a protein produced by the KRAS gene. Normally, the components of the pathway interact in the regulation of cell growth and division and do not individually stimulate cell proliferation.
However, in some cancers, EGFR becomes active even in the absence of EGF, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. Drugs that inhibit EGFR or tyrosine kinase enzymes are often helpful for treating such cancers. Some of these cancers, though, have a mutation in the KRAS gene that produces an abnormal K-Ras protein. The abnormal protein is always active and can stimulate cell growth even in the absence of signals from EGFR or other tyrosine kindase proteins. In such cancers, drugs that inhibit EGFR or tyrosine kinases will not be effective.
KRAS is mutated in 15% to 20% of human cancers, mostly in pancreatic cancer, colon cancer and lung cancers as well as leukemias. Approximately 30% to 40% of colon cancers and 15% to 30% of lung cancers have KRAS mutations. Currently, drugs that target EGFR are used to treat colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. KRAS mutation testing is used to determine whether these drugs will be effective in treating these cancers.
There are several different methods of testing for KRAS mutations, but all of them involve evaluating the KRAS gene in tumor tissue."

HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol.
Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD.
Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack.
In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a))."

This test identifies the specific red blood cell antibodies present in the blood of an individual who has a positive screening test for RBC antibodies (an RBC antibody screen or direct antiglobulin test, DAT).
Each individual inherits a specific combination of RBC antigens, structures found on the surface of the cells, including those associated with the major blood types A, B, AB, and O. Normally, people will only produce antibodies directed against ""foreign"" antigens not found on their own cells. All individuals naturally produce antibodies against the A and/or B antigens that are not on their own RBCs. For example, a person who is blood type A will have antibodies in their blood to the B antigen.
Another important RBC antigen is an Rh antigen called the D antigen. People either have the D antigen on their RBCs (Rh-positive) or do not (Rh-negative). Antibodies to the D antigen are not naturally-occurring; a person who is Rh-negative produces antibodies only after being exposed to RBCs from another person that has the D antigen, for example, a mother exposed to her baby's RBCs during pregnancy or during a blood transfusion.
Blood that is to be transfused must be compatible with the recipient's ABO and Rh blood type because ABO and Rh antibodies present in the recipient's blood have the potential to rapidly destroy (hemolyze) the transfused RBCs and cause serious complications. Antibodies to the major blood types are routinely identified using blood typing tests, and blood for transfusion is matched with the ABO and Rh blood type of the recipient. (For more on this, see Blood Typing and Transfusion Medicine.)
In addition to these ABO and Rh blood group antigens, there are numerous other RBC blood group antigens, such as Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and other Rh antigens. Antibodies to these antigens are not made naturally and are only produced by the body when exposed to them through blood transfusion or when a mother is exposed to a baby's blood cells during pregnancy, labor and delivery. These antibodies may or may not be associated with adverse reactions, and identification of the specific type of RBC antibody present in a person's blood may be important in avoiding these reactions.
Tests that classify antibodies directed against RBC antigens other than ABO are performed when the presence of an antibody is detected through a positive antibody screen (DAT or RBC antibody screen). This screen may be done as part of a ""type and screen,"" which is ordered in situations such as: Part of a prenatal workup
When a blood transfusion has been ordered
Following a suspected transfusion reaction
Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)
Suspected autoimmune hemolytic anemia (in which the body inappropriately makes antibodies against antigens on its own red blood cells) Complications can develop when a person with an RBC antibody is again exposed to RBCs bearing the ""foreign"" antigen, whether by another transfusion or pregnancy. The RBC antibodies may attach to the specific antigens on the foreign RBCs and target them for destruction. Depending on the antigen and antibody involved and the quantity of RBCs affected, this can cause a reaction ranging from mild to severe and potentially life-threatening.
Antibody/antigen combinations capable of destroying RBCs are called clinically significant. The reaction may happen immediately, such as during a blood transfusion, or take longer, from one to several days or longer following a transfusion. RBC destruction, called hemolysis, can occur within blood vessels or in the liver or spleen. Hemolysis can cause signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, flank pain, low blood pressure, bloody urine, and jaundice."

Blood testing detects the dengue virus or antibodies produced in response to dengue infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dengue infections have been reported in more than 100 countries from parts of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. It is a fast emerging infectious disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with an increasing number of cases and countries affected throughout the world. The actual number is not known because about 75% of cases are asymptomatic, but a recent estimate put the number of annual dengue infections as high as 390 million. Approximately 50 to 100 million symptomatic cases occur annually worldwide.
In the U.S., the majority of dengue cases occur in travelers returning from areas where dengue is endemic. Most dengue cases in U.S. citizens occur in people who live in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Samoa and Guam. Outbreaks where a large number of cases occur in a defined area are rare in the U.S. In recent years, there have been small outbreaks in Texas and Hawaii and a few cases diagnosed in southern Florida.
Many individuals will develop no symptoms at all, or have only a mild illness when exposed to one of the four serotypes (1-4) of the dengue virus. For those who do develop symptoms, prognosis is still very good for full recovery within a few weeks. The most common initial symptoms are a sudden high fever (104°F or 40°C) and flu-like symptoms that appear roughly 4 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito (this is called the incubation period and can range from 3 to 14 days). Additional signs and symptoms may include severe headache, especially behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and swollen glands.
Some people who develop a fever will recover on their own with no lasting ill effects while others may progress to severe dengue fever (sometimes called Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever). If the disease progresses to this form, a new wave of symptoms will appear 3 to 7 days after initial symptoms and as the fever recedes. These may include nose bleeds, vomiting blood, passing blood in the stool, difficulty breathing and cold clammy skin, especially in the extremities. During the second phase, the virus may attack blood vessels (the vascular system), causing capillaries to leak fluid into the space around the lungs (pleural effusion) or into the abdominal cavity (ascites).
The loss of blood and fluid during the second phase, if untreated, can worsen and can be fatal. In order to avoid that complication (sometimes called Dengue Shock Syndrome), a healthcare practitioner may hospitalize a patient with severe dengue fever so that falling blood pressure and dehydration caused by the loss of blood and fluids can be managed while the disease runs its course – generally a period of one to two weeks. During the following week of recovery, a person may develop a second rash that lasts a week or more.
Dengue fever is usually diagnosed via some combination of blood tests because the body's immune response to the virus is dynamic and complex. Laboratory tests may include: Molecular tests for dengue virus (PCR)—detect the presence of the virus itself; these tests can diagnose dengue fever up to 7 days after the onset of symptoms and can be used to determine which of the 4 different serotypes of dengue virus is causing the infection.
Antibody tests, IgM and IgG—detect antibodies produced by the immune system when a person has been exposed to the virus; these tests are most effective when performed at least 4 days after exposure.
Complete blood count (CBC)—to look for low platelet count typical of the later stages of the illness and to detect the decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell (RBC) count (evidence of anemia) that would occur with blood loss associated with severe dengue fever"

The infection is difficult to diagnose without laboratory tests because symptoms may initially resemble those of other diseases, such as chikungunya infection. Two primary types of testing are available: Molecular testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR)—this type of test detects the genetic material of the dengue virus in blood within the first week after symptoms appear (fever) and can be used to determine which of the 4 serotypes is causing the infection. One type of Real Time RT-PCR test can detect dengue and the two other mosquito-borne viruses, Zika and chikungunya, and distinguish between the three. Only certain public health laboratories are able to provide the test after verifying that they can successfully perform the assay. Though the test is not available in hospitals or clinics, healthcare practitioners are able to order it through their state and local public health departments. Results can take from four days to two weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 	Molecular tests of blood are not likely to detect the virus after 7 days of illness. If the result of a PCR test is negative, an antibody test can be used to help establish a diagnosis, according to the CDC (see below). Antibody tests—these tests are primarily used to help diagnose a current or recent infection. They detect two different classes of antibodies produced by the body in response to a dengue fever infection, IgG and IgM. Diagnosis may require a combination of these tests because the body's immune system produces varying levels of antibodies over the course of the illness."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/pleural-fluid-testing,Pleural Fluid Testing,[],[],"August 11, 2020.","August 11, 2020.",What is being tested?,"The exterior surface of your lungs and thoracic cavity are lined with continuous membrane known as the pleura. Pleural fluid is layered between the two surfaces so that the opposing surfaces with ""glide"" across each other during breathing. This ""gliding"" movement helps with normal breathing. In healthy individuals, there is about 10 to 20 milliliters of pleural fluid that is evenly distributed across the pleura and it is continually replenished from the blood in the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in your lungs. Certain diseases will increase the pleural volume, usually as a pocket or collection. In these cases, it should be tested and, if necessary, drained.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of these membranes (pleuritis) and/or excessive buildup of pleural fluid (pleural effusion). Pleural fluid testing evaluates this liquid to determine the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons for fluid buildup in the pleural space are: An imbalance between the pressure of the liquid within your blood vessels, which drives fluid out of blood vessels, and the amount of protein in your blood, which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. This type of fluid more commonly involves both sides of your chest and is most frequently a result of either congestive heart failure or cirrhosis.
An injury to or inflammation of the pleurae, in which case the fluid that accumulates is called an exudate. It more commonly involves one side of your chest. Exudates are associated with a variety of conditions and diseases, including:
Infections—caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Infections may start in the pleurae or spread there from other places in your body. For example, pleuritis and pleural effusion may occur along with or following pneumonia.
Bleeding—bleeding disorders, trauma, or blockage in a lung artery (pulmonary embolism) can lead to blood in your pleural fluid.
Inflammatory conditions—such as lung diseases, chronic lung inflammation for example due to prolonged exposure to large amounts of asbestos (asbestosis), sarcoidosis, or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
Malignancies—such as lymphoma, leukemias, lung cancer, metastatic cancers
Other conditions—examples include unknown (idiopathic), heart bypass surgery, heart or lung transplantation, pancreatitis, or abscesses within the abdomen  Determining the type of fluid present is important because it helps to shorten the list of possible causes of your pleural effusion. Healthcare practitioners and laboratory professionals use an initial set of tests (cell count, protein, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) level, and appearance of the fluid) to distinguish between transudates and exudates; part of this evaluation is collection of a blood specimen to compare levels between blood and effusion. If the fluid is an exudate, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing your pleuritis and/or pleural effusion."

The anti-DNase B test measures the amount of this antibody in the blood. It is typically done with or following an antistreptolysin O (ASO) test, another test to detect antibody to a streptococcal antigen.
Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), is the bacterium that causes strep throat and a variety of other infections, including skin infections (pyoderma, impetigo, cellulitis). In most cases, strep infections are diagnosed and successfully treated with antibiotics.
Sometimes a strep infection does not cause identifiable symptoms, goes untreated, or is treated ineffectively, and complications (sequelae), namely rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, can develop, especially in young children. These secondary conditions are uncommon in the U.S. because of routine strep testing and antibiotic treatment, but they do occur. Rheumatic fever is a delayed immune response in which the body produces antibodies directed against itself (autoimmune). This can cause serious damage to heart valves and lead to symptoms such as swelling and pain in several joints, heart inflammation (carditis), skin nodules, rapid, jerky movements (Sydenham chorea), and skin rash.
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a condition affecting the kidneys, can develop a week or two after a strep infection. Your body produces antibodies to fight the strep infection, but these antibodies can eventually be deposited in the glomeruli, which are small, looping blood vessels within the kidneys that continually filter the blood. This can cause inflammation and kidney damage, affecting kidney function."

TB primarily targets the lungs but may affect any area of the body such as the urinary tract, central nervous system, bones, joints, and/or other organs. An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test screens for exposure to TB by indirectly measuring the body's immune response to antigens derived from these bacteria.
TB may cause an inactive (latent) infection or an active, progressive disease. The immune system of about 90% of people who become infected with TB manages to control its growth and confine the TB infection to a few cells in the body. The bacteria in these cells are inactive but still alive. The person does not have any symptoms and is not infectious but does have a ""latent TB infection.""
If, after some time, the immune system of an individual with an inactive infection becomes weakened (compromised), the mycobacteria may begin to grow again, leading to an active case of tuberculosis disease. Active TB does cause illness and can be passed to others through respiratory secretions such as sputum or aerosols released by coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking, singing, or breathing.
The IGRA blood test can detect M. tuberculosis infections, but cannot distinguish between latent and active infections. Additional tests, such as AFB testing, are required to help establish a diagnosis of an active TB infection."

Despite more than 20 years of availability, the test has not earned the confidence of most in the medical community given the lack of data regarding its clinical utility.

The A1c test evaluates the average amount of glucose in the blood over the last 2 to 3 months by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood.
Hemoglobin is an oxygen-transporting protein found inside red blood cells (RBCs). There are several types of normal hemoglobin, but the predominant form – about 95-96% – is hemoglobin A. As glucose circulates in the blood, some of it spontaneously binds to hemoglobin A.
The higher the level of glucose in the blood, the more glycated hemoglobin is formed. Once the glucose binds to the hemoglobin, it remains there for the life of the red blood cell – normally about 120 days. The predominant form of glycated hemoglobin is referred to as A1c. A1c is produced on a daily basis and slowly cleared from the blood as older RBCs die and younger RBCs (with non-glycated hemoglobin) take their place.
An A1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes or risk of developing diabetes. Standards of medical care in diabetes from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) state that diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1c criteria or blood glucose criteria (e.g., the fasting blood glucose (FBG) or the 2-hour glucose tolerance test).
A1c is also used to monitor treatment for individuals diagnosed with diabetes. It helps to evaluate how well your glucose levels have been controlled by treatment over time. For monitoring purposes, an A1c of less than 7% indicates good glucose control and a lower risk of diabetic complications for the majority of people with diabetes.
However, the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that the management of glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes be more ""patient-centered."" It is recommend that people work closely with their healthcare practitioner to select a goal that reflects each person's individual health status and that balances risks and benefits."

Your blood glucose will capture the changes in your blood sugar that occur on a daily basis, the highs and the lows. Each blood glucose is a snapshot and each is different. The A1c is an indication that ""in general"" your glucose has been elevated over the last few months or ""in general"" it has been normal. It is inherently not as sensitive as a blood glucose. However, if your day-to-day glucose control is stable (good or bad), then both the A1c and blood glucose should reflect this. It is important to remember the time lag associated with the A1c. Good glucose control for the past 2-3 weeks will not significantly affect the A1c result for several more weeks."

While this is still generally true, more than a decade of national and international efforts to improve and standardize the A1c test and its reporting led to the release of a consensus statement in 2007 (and an update in 2010) by the ADA, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC), the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, and the International Diabetes Federation.

Kidney stone testing uses one or more test methods to examine and determine the composition of the stone. This is done in order to help identify the cause of the stone and, where possible, to prevent the formation of more stones.
The kidneys are part of the urinary tract, which also consists of two ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. The kidneys filter waste out of the blood and produce urine, which is transported from the kidneys to the bladder through the tube-like ureters. Urine is eliminated from the bladder through the urethra. This is a continual process of waste filtration, urine production, and elimination.
Commonly called kidney stones, calculi can form in the kidneys and cause problems either because they grow large enough to obstruct urine flow or because they become dislodged or break off and begin to travel from a kidney through the ureter. They can cause temporary obstruction but also stretch, irritate, and/or damage the walls of the ureters. This movement can cause abrupt, extremely severe pain that may be intermittent or continuous.
Many stones will eventually pass out of the body in the urine, but some are too large or have too irregular a shape for the body to expel. With very large stones, which typically cannot pass from the kidney into the ureters, and for smaller stones that get into but do not pass through the ureters, some form of treatment will be required. The stone may need to be surgically removed, often using devices that pass through the urethra and bladder to the site of the stone. With some stones, it is possible to pulverize the stone in place using targeted shock waves. This process is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The smaller particles and fragments that remain can then pass through the urinary tract.
Stones can develop for several reasons, but the most common is because there is a high concentration of a particular chemical in the urine that is no longer soluble and precipitates to form crystals. It can also occur when a person chronically fails to take in adequate amounts of fluids, resulting in highly concentrated urine. Depending on how much and what type of material crystallizes and where it forms, a kidney stone may be round, sharp and pointy or irregular with branches (called a staghorn). It can range in size from a grain of sand to bigger than a golf ball. The composition of the stone depends upon what excessive amounts of chemicals are present. It may be all one chemical compound or have different chemicals in different layers.
According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, around 11% of men and 6% of women in the U.S. will have kidney stones at least once in their life. In the U.S., more than half a million people go to the emergency room each year with kidney stones and about a million visit their healthcare provider."

You should filter all of your urine through the fine mesh. This is necessary because there is no way to determine exactly when a stone will pass from the urinary tract. You then examine the mesh for any particulates, keeping in mind that stones may be easily visible or as small as grains of sand. If a stone is found, it is placed into the clean container, allowed to dry, and returned to the laboratory or healthcare provider as instructed. It is important not to add anything to the stone, such as tissue or tape, as this can make testing more difficult.
If you are in a hospital, then medical personnel will filter the urine. With a kidney stone that is too large to pass, a healthcare practitioner may perform a surgical procedure to remove it."

Cortisol is a steroid hormone made by the adrenal glands that is important for regulating glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, suppressing the immune system's response, and helping to maintain blood pressure. This test measures the amount of ACTH in the blood.
ACTH is produced by the pituitary gland. Located below the brain in the center of the head, the pituitary gland is part of the endocrine system, a network of glands that work together to produce hormones that act on organs, tissues, and other glands to regulate systems throughout the body.
Normally, ACTH levels increase when cortisol is low and fall when cortisol is high. In response to a fall in the blood cortisol level, the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This stimulates the production of ACTH by the pituitary, which in turn stimulates the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, small organs located at the top of each kidney. To make the appropriate amounts of cortisol, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands must be functioning properly.
Conditions that affect the hypothalamus, pituitary, or adrenal glands can interfere with regulating ACTH and cortisol production, increasing or decreasing how much of the hormones the glands produce. This can cause signs and symptoms associated with an excess or deficiency of cortisol. Conditions that affect ACTH include Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), and hypopituitarism. Some tumors found outside of the pituitary in locations such as the lungs can also increase cortisol concentrations by producing ACTH."

Studies estimate that at least 8% of children and 5% of adults experience food allergies. Testing can identify food allergies so that they can be more easily avoided and treated."
https://labtestsonline.org/food-allergy-testing,Food Allergy Testing,[],[],"April 16, 2021.","May 6, 2021.",How is food allergy different from food sensitivity and intolerance?,"A food allergy is distinct from a food sensitivity or intolerance. The key difference is that an allergy involves the immune system while most intolerances or sensitivities are related to the gastrointestinal system.
Examples of non-allergic reactions to food include lactose intolerance (an inability to properly digest a sugar found in milk products), sensitivity to caffeine, and intolerance to gluten. While these can cause bothersome symptoms, they don’t provoke an excessive immune response and are not allergic reactions.
Other important differences usually found between food allergies and intolerances and sensitivities include: For food allergies, the quantity consumed often doesn’t matter, and even contact of the food with the skin may provoke a reaction. For intolerances and sensitivities, increased consumption usually worsens symptoms.
Symptoms tend to be the same each time for intolerances and sensitivities. In contrast, reactions after allergen exposure can vary in the type of symptoms and their severity, including the possibility of life-threatening reactions. Food allergy testing is focused on identifying things that trigger the immune system, and, as a result, is distinct from food sensitivity testing."
https://labtestsonline.org/food-allergy-testing,Food Allergy Testing,[],[],"April 16, 2021.","May 6, 2021.",When should testing be done?,"Experts recommend food allergy testing only after symptoms of an allergy have occurred.
There is no single test to look for all food allergies, and tests can show signs of an allergy when no real allergic reaction occurs. This is known as a false positive result. Because a test that looks for all possible allergens can return many false positives, doctors normally order food allergy tests that look only for specific allergens based on your history of symptoms."

This test detects intrinsic factor antibody (IF antibody) circulating in blood.
Intrinsic factor is a protein produced by a type of specialized cells that line the stomach wall known as parietal cells. During digestion, stomach acids release vitamin B12 from food and bind to intrinsic factor to form a complex. The formation of this complex is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.
Among having functional roles in the brain and nervous system, vitamin B12 is important in the production of red blood cells. Without sufficient intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 goes largely unabsorbed and the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells, leading to anemia. Besides anemia, decrease in the numbers of neutrophils and platelets (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) may also occur.
Anemia that is due to a lack of intrinsic factor is called pernicious anemia. This is primarily an autoimmune condition that occurs when the body's immune system targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against the parietal cells and/or the intrinsic factor. These antibodies can damage the parietal cells and disrupt intrinsic factor production or prevent intrinsic factor from carrying out its biological function.
Two types of IF antibodies can be tested by the laboratory: Intrinsic factor blocking antibody (type 1), which is more specific for pernicious anemia and is the one that is usually tested.
Intrinsic factor binding antibody (type 2), which interferes with the uptake of the vitamin B12-instrinsic factor complex."

It may be prescribed in combination with other antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. The valproic acid level in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. This test measures the level of valproic acid in the blood.
Seizure disorders affect the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, someone may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. Seizures are associated with several conditions but, in many cases, the cause is not known. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to frequent, recurrent seizures. Rarely, someone may have a seizure that does not stop without prompt medical intervention. People may experience some fatigue and a short period of confusion after a seizure. Muscle contractions during a seizure can lead to an injury and, in some cases, recurrent seizures can eventually lead to progressive brain damage but, for most people, there will be little or no residual damage.
Sometimes valproic acid is prescribed for bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by cycles of depression and mania that may last for days, weeks, months, or years. During a depressive episode, those affected may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and have thoughts of suicide. During a manic episode, those affected may be euphoric, irritable, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Valproic acid is prescribed to help even out the moods, especially those of mania, of the person with bipolar disorder. The drug is also used to treat people with recurrent migraine headaches to help prevent their occurrence and to treat certain chronic pain syndromes.
The valproic acid level in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, someone may experience a recurrence of symptoms, but, if the level is too high, someone may experience an increase in the number and severity of symptoms and side effects. The balance is often difficult to achieve because the drug is metabolized by the liver and is processed at a rate that varies from person to person and is affected by age and liver health.
Most valproic acid is bound to protein in the blood and it is the unbound ""free"" portion that has therapeutic effect. If someone has a condition that results in a lower than normal amount of protein in their blood, then that person may have an excess of active ""free"" valproic acid.
Dosages of valproic acid must be adjusted carefully until a steady concentration in the blood is reached. The actual amount of drug that it takes to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may change over time."

A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. A glucose tolerance test measures the level of glucose in your blood when you are fasting and then 2 hours after drinking a liquid containing a specific amount of glucose.
During digestion, the carbohydrates that you eat are broken down into glucose (and other nutrients). They are absorbed by the digestive tract, move into the blood, and circulate throughout the body. Normally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and the hormone insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response. The amount of insulin released corresponds to the size and content of the meal. Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. As glucose moves into the cells and is broken down (metabolized), the blood glucose level drops and the pancreas responds by decreasing the release of insulin. (The glucose tolerance test does not require the body to break down carbohydrates into glucose since the glucose in the liquid that you drink is already free.)
If this glucose/insulin blood feedback system is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the feedback system is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance by increasing insulin production If the body's pancreatic beta cells can do so.
Diabetes is the most common disease resulting from an imbalance between glucose and insulin. Type 1 diabetes results when the body is not able to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels. Usually in type 1 diabetes, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells) have been destroyed by the person's own immune system.
Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance (the body does not react normally to insulin) and a relative decline in insulin production.
Some women may develop gestational diabetes, which is high blood glucose that occurs only during the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. (For more information, see the article on Glucose Testing for Gestational Diabetes.) Chronically high blood glucose levels can cause progressive damage to body organs, such as the kidneys, eyes, heart and blood vessels, and nerves. For more information, read the article on Diabetes."

It is generally recommended that thyroid testing be avoided in hospitalized patients or deferred until after a person has recovered from an acute illness."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/thyroid-stimulating-hormone-tsh,Thyroid-stimulating Hormone (TSH),"['Thyrotropin', 'TSH']",[],"October 16, 2018.","April 20, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland, a small organ located below the brain and behind the sinus cavities. TSH stimulates the thyroid, a small butterfly-shaped gland located inside the neck in front of the windpipe, by binding to the TSH receptor to release the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the blood. This test measures the amount of TSH in the blood.
T4 and T3 help control the rate at which the body uses energy. Most of the hormone produced by the thyroid is T4. This hormone is relatively inactive, but it is converted into the much more active T3 in the liver and other tissues.
TSH, along with its regulatory hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which comes from the hypothalamus, is part of the feedback system that the body uses to maintain stable amounts of thyroid hormones in the blood. When thyroid hormone levels decrease in the blood, the pituitary gland produces more TSH in response to TRH stimulation. TSH in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce and release more T4 and T3.
When thyroid hormone levels increase in the blood, the pituitary gland produces less TSH, and the thyroid produces less T4 and T3. When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid releases inappropriately large amounts of T4 and T3, the affected person may experience symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as rapid heart rate, weight loss, nervousness, hand tremors, irritated eyes, and difficulty sleeping. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the affected person's immune system produces autoantibodies that act like TSH, bind and activate the TSH receptor, leading to the production of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. In response, the pituitary produces less TSH, usually leading to a low level in the blood.
If there is decreased production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid (underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism), the person may experience symptoms such as weight gain, dry skin, constipation, cold intolerance, and fatigue. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. It is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune response causes inflammation and damage to the thyroid as well as the production of autoantibodies. However, the autoantibodies do not cause the hypothyroidism. The detection of thyroid-related autoantibodies (e.g., thyroperoxidase autoantibodies and/or thyroglobulin autoantibodies) indicate that thyroid autoimmunity is present. These autoantibodies can be detected in Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis. With Hashimoto thyroiditis, the thyroid produces low levels of thyroid hormone. In response, the pituitary normally produces more TSH, usually resulting in a high level in the blood.
However, the level of TSH alone does not always predict or reflect thyroid hormone levels. Some people with pituitary disease produce an abnormal form of TSH that does not function properly. They often have hypothyroidism despite having normal or even mildly elevated TSH levels.
Rarely, pituitary dysfunction may result in increased or decreased amounts of TSH. In addition to pituitary dysfunction, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism can occur if there is a problem with the hypothalamus (insufficient or excessive TRH)."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/ferritin,Ferritin,['Serum Ferritin'],"['Ferritin, serum']","March 28, 2018.","June 18, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Ferritin is a protein that contains iron and is the primary form of iron stored inside of cells. The small amount of ferritin that is released and circulates in the blood is a reflection of the total amount of iron stored in the body. This test measures the amount of ferritin in the blood.
Iron is an essential trace element and nutrient that, among other functions, is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.
In healthy people, most of the iron absorbed by the body is incorporated into the hemoglobin of red blood cells. Most of the remaining is stored as ferritin or as hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes. Ferritin and hemosiderin are present primarily in the liver but also in the bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscles.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops, iron stores are depleted and ferritin levels decrease. This may occur because: Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease
There is an increased need for iron such as during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer). Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron-deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. (Read the article on Anemia to learn more.)
Conversely, iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a rare genetic disease in which the body absorbs too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overload can occur when a person undergoes repeated blood transfusions."

This test measures the current lead level in the blood. Approximately 1% of lead is found free in blood, so the blood lead level (BLL) may not reflect actual lead levels.
You can be exposed to lead by breathing in or ingesting lead dust or by absorbing it through your skin to a lesser degree. In adults, most lead is absorbed via inhalation, but in children most absorption occurs through the digestive tract. Once absorbed, lead is distributed to blood, soft tissues, and bone. Lead can cause damage to the brain, organs, and nervous system.
Even with long-term exposure of low levels, lead can cause irreversible damage without associated physical symptoms. In an infant, lead can cause permanent cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and developmental delays. Symptoms of lead toxicity are different depending on whether the exposure to lead was acute or chronic. Acute lead exposure can cause constipation, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, joint/muscle aches, headache, depression, and decreased sex drive. At blood lead levels greater than 150 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL), brain damage may occur, resulting in coma, seizure, or death. Chronic, low level exposure can cause depression, anxiety, decreased neuromotor function, anemia, and kidney damage. Chronic lead exposure has also been linked to hypertension, but the degree of association is not well established. Lead can be passed from mothers to their unborn children and can cause miscarriages and premature births.
In the past, lead was used in paints, gasoline, water pipes, and other household products, such as the solder used in canned food. Although these uses have been limited in the U.S., lead is still used in many products and industrial processes both in the U.S. and around the world. Housing built prior to 1978 may contain lead-based paint and lead-contaminated household dust. Soil surrounding these houses may also be contaminated with lead. In addition, approximately 10 million people receive their water from pipes that are at least partially lead.
Children under 3 years of age are the most susceptible to lead exposure and poisoning. Increased risk of lead toxic effects are due to an incomplete blood brain barrier, higher tendency for iron deficiency, and because children often put their hands in their mouths, accidentally ingesting lead dust or paint chips. They can also inhale lead dust and mouth or chew lead-contaminated items. Adult lead exposure is usually related to occupational or recreational (hobby) exposure. Children of those who work with lead may also become exposed when lead contamination is brought home on the work clothes of their parents.

Iron tests evaluate the amount of iron in the body by measuring several substances in the blood. These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload. Serum iron test—measures the level of iron in the liquid portion of the blood.
Transferrin test—directly measures the level of transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is the protein that transports iron around in the body. Under normal conditions, transferrin is typically one-third saturated with iron. This means that about two-thirds of its capacity is held in reserve.
TIBC (total iron-binding capacity)—measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by proteins in the blood. Since transferrin is the primary iron-binding protein, the TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin availability.
UIBC (unsaturated iron-binding capacity)—The UIBC test determines the reserve capacity of transferrin, i.e., the portion of transferrin that has not yet been saturated with iron. UIBC also reflects transferrin levels.
Transferrin saturation—a calculation that reflects the percentage of transferrin that is saturated with iron (100 x serum iron/TIBC).
Serum ferritin—reflects the amount of stored iron in the body. Iron is normally absorbed from food in the small intestine and transported throughout the body by binding to transferrin, a protein produced by the liver. In healthy people, most of the iron transported is incorporated into the production of red blood cell hemoglobin. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because: There is an increased need for iron, for example during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer)
Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron-deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, smaller and paler red cells). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. Read the article on Anemia to learn more.
Conversely, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body absorbs and builds up too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overdose can occur when someone consumes more than the recommended amount of iron."

Hemoglobin and hematocrit are tests that are performed as part of a complete blood count (CBC). A low value for either test indicates that a person has anemia. Iron deficiency is a very common cause of anemia. The average size of red cells (Mean Corpuscular Volume or MCV) and the average amount of hemoglobin in red cells (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin or MCH) are also measured in a CBC. In iron deficiency, insufficient hemoglobin is made, causing the red blood cells to be smaller than normal. Both MCV and MCH are low. In addition, the hemoglobin concentration in red cells (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration or MCHC) is decreased; the red cells in iron deficiency anemia look much paler than normal ones."

CK-BB almost never gets into the blood, and CK-MB will typically only be present in significant amounts when the heart is damaged.

It is a living, growing tissue that turns over at a rate of about 10% a year. Bone markers are blood and urine tests that detect products of bone remodeling to help determine if the rate of bone resorption and/or formation is abnormally increased, suggesting a potential bone disorder. The markers can be used to help determine a person's risk of bone fracture and to monitor drug therapy for people receiving treatment for bone disorders, such as osteoporosis and Paget disease.
Bone is made up largely of type-I collagen, a protein network that gives the bone its tensile strength and framework, and calcium phosphate, a mineralized complex that hardens the skeletal framework. This combination of collagen and calcium gives bone its hardness, and yet bones are flexible enough to bear weight and withstand stress. More than 99% of the body's calcium is contained in the bones and teeth. Most of the remaining 1% is found in the blood.
Throughout a person's lifetime, bone is constantly being remodeled to maintain a healthy bone structure. There are two major types of cells within bone: osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are the cells that lay down new bone, but they first initiate bone resorption by stimulating osteoclasts, which dissolve small amounts of bone in the area that needs strengthening using acid and enzymes to dissolve the protein network.
Osteoblasts then initiate new bone formation by secreting a variety of compounds that help form a new protein network, which is then mineralized with calcium and phosphate. This on-going remodeling process takes place on a microscopic scale throughout the body to keep bones alive and sturdy.
During early childhood and in the teenage years, new bone is added faster than old bone is removed. As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and denser. Bone formation happens faster than bone resorption until a person reaches their peak bone mass (maximum bone density and strength) between the ages of 25 and 30 years.
After this peak period, bone resorption occurs faster than the rate of bone formation, leading to net bone loss. The age at which an individual begins to experience symptoms of bone loss depends on the amount of bone that was developed during their youth and the rate of bone resorption. Traditionally, women exhibit these symptoms earlier than men because they may not have developed as much bone during the peak years and, after menopause, rate of bone loss is accelerated in some women.
Several diseases and conditions can cause an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, and bone markers can be useful in detecting the imbalance and bone loss. Most often, the markers have been studied in the evaluation and monitoring of osteoporosis, including age-related osteoporosis or secondary osteoporosis, which is bone loss due to an underlying condition. Bone loss may result from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease, chronic kidney disease, multiple myeloma, or from prolonged use of drugs such as anti-epileptics, glucocorticoids, or lithium.
In children, bone markers are also useful in helping to diagnose metabolic bone diseases and in monitoring treatment of these conditions. Examples include rickets, juvenile Paget disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, sometimes called brittle bone disease, and hypophosphatemic rickets, a type of rickets associated with low phosphate levels and hypophosphatasia (HPP), a disorder causing abnormal development of bones and teeth.

A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. Glucose tests measure the level of glucose in your blood or detect glucose in your urine.
A few different protocols may be used to evaluate glucose levels. This article focuses on: Fasting blood glucose (commonly called fasting blood sugar)—this test measures the level after a fast of at least 8 hours.
Random blood glucose—sometimes your blood glucose will be measured when you have not fasted (randomly). Other types of glucose tests include: A glucose tolerance test measures glucose levels after fasting and after you drink liquid containing a specific amount of glucose (see Glucose Tolerance Test).
A specific protocol is used to help diagnose gestational diabetes, which is diabetes that first develops during pregnancy (see Glucose Tests for Gestational Diabetes).
Urine is routinely tested for glucose as part of a urinalysis. During digestion, the carbohydrates that you eat are broken down into glucose (and other nutrients). They are absorbed by the digestive tract, move into the blood, and circulate throughout the body. Normally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and the hormone insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response. The amount of insulin released corresponds to the size and content of the meal. Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. As glucose moves into the cells and is broken down (metabolized), the blood glucose level drops and the pancreas responds by decreasing the release of insulin.
If this glucose/insulin blood feedback system is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the feedback system is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance by increasing insulin production.
Diabetes is the most common disease resulting from an imbalance between glucose and insulin. Type 1 diabetes results when the body is not able to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels. Usually in type 1 diabetes, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells) have been destroyed by the person's own immune system.
Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance (the body does not react normally to insulin) and a relative decline in insulin production.
Some women may develop gestational diabetes, which is high blood glucose that develops during pregnancy. (For more information, see the article on Glucose Tests for Gestational Diabetes.) Severe, acute changes in blood glucose, either high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia), can be life-threatening, causing organ failure, brain damage, coma, and, in some cases, death. Chronically high blood glucose levels that can occur with untreated or poorly controlled diabetes can cause progressive damage to body organs such as the kidneys, eyes, heart and blood vessels, and nerves. Chronic hypoglycemia can lead to brain and nerve damage."

Screening can be useful in helping to identify it and allowing for treatment before the condition worsens or complications arise. If the initial screening result is abnormal, the test should be repeated. The repeat result must also be abnormal to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes.

The tests measure levels of various substances, including several minerals, electrolytes, proteins, and glucose (sugar), in the blood to determine the current health of your kidneys.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located at the bottom of the ribcage to the right and left of the spine. They are part of the urinary tract and perform a few essential roles and functions within the body. Within the kidneys are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a cluster of looping blood vessels, called a glomerulus, which allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells, proteins such as albumin, and larger molecules.
Attached to each glomerulus are tubes (tubules) that have a number of sections that collect the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus, reabsorb what can be re-used by the body, add other molecules through a process called secretion and, finally, adjust the amount of water that is eventually eliminated along with the waste as urine.
Besides eliminating wastes and helping to regulate the amount of water in the body, these activities allow the kidneys to maintain normal chemical balance in the body. Among the important substances the kidneys help to regulate are sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. The right balance of these substances is critical. When the kidneys are not working properly, the concentrations of these substances in the blood may be abnormal and waste products and fluid may build up to dangerous levels in the blood, creating a life-threatening situation.
Kidneys also have a number of other miscellaneous roles in maintaining a healthy body, including the production of a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production (called erythropoietin), production of a hormone that helps maintain a normal blood pressure (called renin), and turning one form of vitamin D into a more active form, which enhances calcium absorption. If the kidneys are not functioning properly, waste products can accumulate in the blood and fluid levels can increase to dangerous volumes, causing damage to the body or a potentially life-threatening situation. Numerous conditions and diseases can result in damage to the kidneys. The most common causes of and main risk factors for kidney disease are diabetes and hypertension. For more on the types and causes, see the article on Kidney Disease.
The individual tests included in a renal panel can vary by laboratory, but the tests typically performed include:
Electrolytes – electrically charged chemicals that are vital to normal body processes, such as nerve and muscle function; among other things, they help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. Electrolytes include: Sodium
Potassium
Chloride
Bicarbonate (Total CO2) Minerals Phosphorus – a mineral that is vital for energy production, muscle and nerve function, and bone growth; it also plays an important role as a buffer, helping to maintain the body's acid-base balance.
Calcium – one of the most important minerals in the body; it essential for the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart and is required in blood clotting and in the formation of bones. Protein Albumin – a protein that makes up about 60% of protein in the blood and has many roles such as keeping fluid from leaking out of blood vessels and transporting hormones, vitamins, drugs, and ions like calcium throughout the body. Waste products Urea/Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) – urea is a nitrogen-containing waste product that forms from the metabolism of protein; it is released by the liver into the blood and is carried to the kidneys, where it is filtered out of the blood and eliminated in the urine.
Creatinine – another waste product that is produced by the body's muscles; almost all creatinine is eliminated by the kidneys. Energy Source Glucose – supplies energy for the body; a steady amount must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. Three calculated values may also be reported with a renal panel: Urea (BUN)/Creatinine Ratio – a comparison of urea (nitrogen) to creatinine content in the blood
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) – a calculated estimate of the actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR, the amount of blood filtered by the glomeruli in the kidneys per minute) derived from creatinine levels in the blood; the formula takes into account the person's age, gender, race, and sometimes height and weight.
Anion Gap – anion gap (AG or AGAP) is a value calculated using the results of an electrolyte panel. It evaluates the difference between measured and unmeasured electrical particles (ions or electrolytes) in the fluid portion of the blood."

Troponin tests measure the level of cardiac-specific troponin in the blood to help detect heart injury.
There are three types of troponin proteins: troponin C, troponin T, and troponin I. Troponin C initiates contraction by binding calcium and moves troponin I so that the two proteins that pull the muscle fiber shorter can interact. Troponin T anchors the troponin complex to the muscle fiber structure. There is little or no difference in troponin C between skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the forms of troponin I and troponin T are different. Measuring the amount of cardiac-specific troponin T or troponin I in the blood can help identify individuals who have experienced damage to their heart.
Normally, troponin is present in very small to undetectable quantities in the blood. When there is damage to heart muscle cells, troponin is released into the blood. The more damage there is, the greater the concentration in the blood. Primarily, troponin tests are used to help determine if an individual has suffered a heart attack. They may also be helpful in evaluating someone for other forms of heart injury.
Many laboratories in the U.S. use high-sensitivity troponin tests since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved them in 2017. Because this version of the test is more sensitive than previous, older versions, it becomes positive sooner and may help detect heart injury and acute coronary syndrome earlier. The hs-troponin test may also be positive in people with stable angina and even in people with no symptoms. When it is elevated in these individuals, it indicates an increased risk of future heart events such as heart attacks.
When a person has a heart attack, levels of cardiac-specific troponins I and T can become elevated in the blood within 3 or 4 hours after injury and may remain elevated for 10 to 14 days."

That is because the body normally converts homocysteine into other products quickly. Since vitamins B6, B12, and folate are necessary to metabolize homocysteine, increased levels of the amino acid may be a sign of deficiency in those vitamins. This test determines the level of homocysteine in the blood and/or urine.
Elevated homocysteine may also be related to a higher risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (fatty deposits in peripheral arteries), and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). High levels of homocysteine increase the risk of blood clot formation in vessels and may lead to heart attack and stroke. Several mechanisms have been proposed for how homocysteine leads to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, but direct links haven not been confirmed. There are also several studies that indicate no benefit or lowering of CVD risk with folic acid and B vitamin supplements. So far, the American Heart Association does not consider it a major risk factor for heart disease.
A rare inherited condition called homocystinuria can also greatly increase homocysteine in the blood and urine. In the U.S., all babies are routinely tested for excess methionine, a sign of homocystinuria, as part of their newborn screening. If a baby's screening test is positive, then urine and blood homocysteine tests are often performed. For more information, see Common Questions below."

Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg by a sperm cell, but there are several steps that male and female bodies must go through for a healthy pregnancy to be possible. Some of the steps include: Hormones trigger an ovary to release one egg in a process called ovulation.
A partner must produce viable and sufficient sperm.
As the egg travels through a fallopian tube to the uterus, it must encounter a sperm cell to be fertilized.
The fertilized egg must then get implanted in the lining of the uterus, where it can grow and develop during pregnancy.  If an egg is not fertilized in that cycle, the body sheds the egg and the lining of the uterus during menstruation."

It is defined as not getting pregnant after one year of sex without contraception. Infertility is often due to a problem with one or more steps in the process of becoming pregnant.
Infertility is diagnosed after a couple has tried to get pregnant for 12 months without success, or after 6 months if the woman is over age 35.
Infertility affects around 9% of men and 11% of women of reproductive age in the United States. Although a couple’s infertility can sometimes be traced back to one partner, in around one-third of couples, both partners are responsible for the infertility. In 10-20% of infertile couples, no specific cause can be found."
https://labtestsonline.org/fertility-testing,Fertility Testing,[],[],"April 30, 2021.","May 17, 2021.",Who should get testing?,"Couples who are experiencing infertility or who have underlying medical issues should speak to their physician to find out if they should get tested and which tests are indicated for their unique situation.
Fertility testing can help a couple plan for pregnancy, whether the goal is to become pregnant or to avoid pregnancy.
In addition to those already experiencing infertility, there are some risk factors to identify that may affect a couple's fertility. An infertility evaluation may be important when the couple meets one or several of the following risk factors: Women over age 40
Irregular or absent menstrual periods
Family history of early menopause or premature ovarian failure
History of ovarian surgery
Advanced stage endometriosis
Uterine or tubal disease
Exposure to cytotoxic drugs or pelvic radiation therapy
Autoimmune disease
Smoking
Adult mumps
History of testicular trauma
Impotence or other sexual dysfunction
A history of fertility issues with another partner In women between 35 and 40 years of age without a risk factor, an infertility evaluation may be recommended after attempting to conceive for six months.
In younger couples without risk factors for infertility, experts recommend trying to conceive for a year before having an infertility evaluation. Couples in this category may benefit from tracking fertility and timing intercourse with ovulation. A physician or reproductive endocrinologist can assist couples in creating a tailored plan for fertility testing.
Getting test results
When a fertility test is prescribed by a doctor, results may be discussed during a follow-up appointment or by telephone. At that time, you will typically have an opportunity to ask questions and make sure that you understand your test results and any follow-up testing that may be necessary. Understanding the results of fertility testing can be complex, and decision-making may depend on results of more than one test.
For at-home fertility testing, results may be available immediately, over the phone, or through a website or smartphone app. When using at-home fertility testing, it’s important to discuss results with your doctor to understand what they mean for your fertility."

Varicella zoster virus tests detect either antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a VZV infection or detect the virus itself.
Tests for chickenpox and shingles may be performed to detect and diagnose a current or past infection with VZV. Most often, testing is not necessary to diagnosis an active infection because it can be made from clinical signs and symptoms, but in some people with atypical skin lesions, a diagnostic test helps to confirm the infection. In some people, especially organ transplant recipients and pregnant women, the tests may be used to diagnose a current infection or to determine whether or not they have developed immunity from prior infection or by vaccination.
Before the introduction and widespread use of a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, nearly everyone in the United States became infected by VZV by adulthood. While VZV is present in its latent form in many adults who were infected as children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incidence of new cases of chickenpox has declined significantly. Two doses of the vaccine are about 98% effective in preventing the infection, and those who do become infected usually have milder symptoms.
Varicella zoster virus can cause chickenpox in the young and in adults who have not been vaccinated or previously exposed. The primary infection is highly contagious, passing from person to person through coughing or sneezing or touching fluid from blisters. In a primary infection, signs and symptoms include an itchy rash that emerges about two weeks after exposure to the virus, followed by the formation of pimple-like papules that become small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles). The vesicles break, form a crust, and then heal. This process occurs in two or three waves or ""crops"" of several hundred vesicles over a few days.
Once the initial infection has resolved, the virus becomes latent, persisting in sensory nerve cells. The person develops  antibodies during the infection that usually prevent them from getting chickenpox again. However, later in life and in those with weakened immune systems, the virus can reactivate, migrating down the nerve cells to the skin, causing shingles (also known as herpes zoster).
Symptoms of shingles include a mild to intense burning or itching pain in a band of skin at the waist, the face, or another location. It is usually in one place on one side of the body but can also occur in multiple locations. Several days after the pain, itching, or tingling begins, a rash, with or without vesicles, forms in the same location. In most people, the rash and pain subside within a few weeks, and the virus again becomes latent. A few may have pain that lingers for several months.
A shingles vaccine is now available for older adults. This vaccine lowers the risk of the virus reactivating as shingles and lessens the severity of the symptoms if shingles do occur. In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) began recommending a shingles vaccination for all adults aged 60 years and older. However, the vaccine is not recommended for those who have weakened immune systems.
Most cases of chickenpox and shingles resolve without complications. In people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients, the disease can be more severe and long-lasting. In some cases, it may not become latent and may spread to the central nervous system.
In pregnant women, the effects of exposure to VZV on a developing baby or newborn depend on when it occurs and on whether or not the mother has been previously exposed. In the first 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy, a primary VZV infection may, rarely, cause congenital abnormalities in the unborn baby. If the infection occurs one to three weeks before delivery, the baby may be born with or acquire chickenpox after birth, although the baby may be partially protected by the mother's antibodies. If a newborn is exposed to VZV at birth and does not have maternal antibody protection, then the VZV infection can be fatal."

Blood tests for Epstein-Barr virus detect antibodies to EBV in the blood and help establish a diagnosis of EBV infection.
Epstein-Barr virus causes an infection that is very common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people in the United States are infected by EBV at some point in their lives. The virus is very contagious and easily passed from person to person. It is present in the saliva of infected individuals and can be spread through close contact such as kissing and through sharing utensils or cups.
After initial exposure to EBV, there is a period of several weeks before associated symptoms may appear, called the incubation period. During the acute primary infection, the virus multiplies in number. This is followed by a decrease in viral numbers and resolution of symptoms, but the virus never completely goes away. Latent EBV remains in the person's body for the rest of that person's life and may reactivate but usually causes few problems unless the person's immune system is significantly weakened.
Most people are infected by EBV in childhood and experience few or no symptoms. However, when the initial infection occurs in adolescence, it can cause infectious mononucleosis, commonly called mono, a condition associated with fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen, and sometimes an enlarged liver. These symptoms occur in about 25% of infected teens and young adults and usually resolve within a month or two.
People with mono are typically diagnosed by their symptoms and the findings from a complete blood count (CBC) and a mono test (which tests for a heterophile antibody). About 25% of those with mono do not produce heterophile antibodies and will have a negative mono test; this is especially true with children. Tests for EBV antibodies can be used to determine whether or not the symptoms these people are experiencing are due to a current infection with the EBV virus.
EBV is the most common cause of mono. According to the CDC, examples of other causes of mono include cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, rubella, and toxoplasmosis. Sometimes, it can be important to distinguish EBV from these other illnesses. For instance, it may be important to diagnose the cause of symptoms of a viral illness in a pregnant woman. Testing can help to distinguish a primary EBV infection, which has not been shown to affect a developing baby, from a CMV, herpes simplex virus, or toxoplasmosis infection, as these illnesses can cause complications during the pregnancy and may harm the fetus.
It can also be important to rule out EBV infection and to look for other causes of the symptoms. Those with strep throat, an infection caused by group A streptococcus, for instance, need to be identified and treated with antibiotics. A person may have strep throat instead of mono or may have both conditions at the same time.
Several tests for different types and classes of EBV antibodies are available. The antibodies are proteins produced by the body in an immune response to several different Epstein-Barr virus antigens. During a primary EBV infection, the level of each of these EBV antibodies rises and falls at various times as the infection progresses. Measurement of these antibodies in the blood can aid in diagnosis and typically provides the healthcare practitioner with information about the stage of infection and whether it is a current, recent, or past infection.  Antibody
Timing of when the antibody is typically detected in the blood
Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-IgM antibody
Appears first after exposure to the virus and then tends to disappear after about 4 to 6 weeks
VCA-IgG antibody
Emerges during acute infection with the highest level at 2 to 4 weeks, then drops slightly, stabilizes, and is present for life
Early Antigen (EA-D) antibody
Appears during the acute infection phase and then tends to disappear; about 20% of those infected will continue to have detectable quantities for several years after the EBV infection has resolved.
Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) antibody
Does not usually appear until the acute infection has resolved; it develops about 2 to 4 months after the initial infection and is then is present for life."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/acetaminophen,Acetaminophen,['Paracetamol'],[],"January 4, 2019.","November 16, 2020.",What is being tested?,"Acetaminophen is one of the most common pain relievers (analgesics) and fever reducers (antipyretics) available over the counter. It is generally regarded as safe. However, it is also the most common cause of toxic hepatitis in North America and Europe and one of the most common poisonings from either accidental or intentional overdose.
Once entering your body, like many other medications, acetaminophen is processed in the liver into harmless substances and removed in your urine. However, about 5 to 10% of the absorbed acetaminophen is converted to a toxic, highly-reactive byproduct. Fortunately, your liver makes a antioxidant called glutathione that binds to the byproduct and minimizes its toxic effects. When a large dose of acetaminophen is ingested or that exceeds the recommended amount over a period of time, the liver is no longer able to produce enough protective glutathione; as a result, the toxic byproduct builds up in the liver and may cause severe liver damage if timely treatment is not given.
For this reason, acetaminophen can be harmful or even fatal if not taken correctly and children in particular are at risk if caregivers do not follow dosing instructions carefully. Often, people do not realize that acetaminophen is one of the ingredients in many combination medications such as cold and flu preparations. If two or more of these medications are taken together, levels of acetaminophen may exceed safe limits.
Acetaminophen preparations come in varying strengths and several different forms, including tablets, capsules and liquid. For adults, the typical maximum daily limit for acetaminophen is 4000 milligrams (mg). Consuming more than 4000 mg in a 24-hour period is considered an overdose, while ingesting more than 7000 mg can lead to a severe overdose reaction unless treated promptly.
For children, the amount that is considered an overdose depends on their age and body weight. (For more on this, see the MayoClinic webpage Acetaminophen and children: Why dose matters.) If it is known or suspected that someone has ingested an overdose of acetaminophen, it is recommended to take the person to the emergency room. If a health practitioner determines that an overdose has occurred, treatment may include an antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which can help minimize damage to the liver, especially if given within 8 to 12 hours after an overdose. Though NAC is ideally administered within this timeframe, people who seek treatment more than 12 hours after ingestion may still be given the antidote.
Until recently, NAC for people who visit healthcare providers later than 24 hours after acetaminophen ingestion was not the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose management in the United States. However, study data from England suggest that NAC may be beneficial for acetaminophen-induced liver failure more than 24 hours after ingestion."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/acetaminophen,Acetaminophen,['Paracetamol'],[],"January 4, 2019.","November 16, 2020.",How is the test used?,"The test for acetaminophen is used to measure the level of drug in the blood in order to establish a diagnosis of overdose, to assess the risk of liver damage, and to help decide on the need for treatment.

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/acetaminophen,Acetaminophen,['Paracetamol'],[],"January 4, 2019.","November 16, 2020.",When is it ordered?,Healthcare practitioners may order acetaminophen levels beginning at 4 hours after ingestion or possible ingestion and then every 4 to 6 hours to monitor whether the drug level is increasing or decreasing.

A healthcare practitioner might also order serum salicylate levels or a urine drug screen for unconscious patients or those for whom there is a suspicion of ingestion of other substances.

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/tumor-markers,Tumor Markers,[],[],"January 22, 2019.","March 24, 2021.",What are tumor markers?,"Tumor markers are substances, often proteins, that are produced by the cancer tissue itself or sometimes by the body in response to cancer growth. Because some of these substances can be detected in body samples such as blood, urine, and tissue, these markers may be used, along with other tests and procedures, to help detect and diagnose some types of cancer, predict and monitor a person's response to certain treatments, and detect recurrence.
More recently, the idea of what constitutes a tumor marker has broadened. Newer types of tests have been developed that look for changes in genetic material (DNA, RNA), rather than proteins, in patient samples. The genetic changes have been found to be associated with certain cancers and can be used as tumor markers to help determine prognosis, guide targeted treatment, and/or detect cancers early on. Moreover, advances in technology have led to tests that can evaluate several genetic markers or panels of markers at the same time, providing expanded information about characteristics of a tumor. Examples of these are included, along with more traditional tumor markers, in the table within this article.
While quite a few tumor markers are available and have been found to be clinically useful, others are available but not ordered frequently because they have been found to be less sensitive and/or specific. Still others are currently used only in research settings and continue to be evaluated in clinical trials. With ongoing research, and as the field continues to evolve, it is likely that more tumor markers with greater effectiveness will come on the market in the coming years, eventually replacing less useful ones.
Limitations
While tumor marker tests can provide very useful information, they do have limitations: Many tumor markers may also be elevated in persons with conditions or diseases other than cancer.
Some tumor markers are specific for a particular type of cancer, while others are seen in several different types of cancer.
Not every person with a particular type of cancer will have an elevated level of the corresponding tumor marker.
Not every cancer has a tumor marker that has been identified as associated with it. Consequently, tumor markers alone are not diagnostic for cancer; for some types of cancer, they provide additional information that can be considered in conjunction with a patient's medical history and physical exam as well as other laboratory and/or imaging tests."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/tumor-markers,Tumor Markers,[],[],"January 22, 2019.","March 24, 2021.",How are tumor markers used?,"Tumor markers may be used for a variety of purposes. However, they are not typically used alone. Depending on the type of cancer, they may be used in conjunction with a tissue biopsy or a bone marrow or blood smear examination, for example, and/or with other tumor markers. They are not definitive but provide additional information that can be used to help: Screen. Because most tumor markers are not sensitive or specific enough, these tests are not well suited for screening the general population; however, a few may be used to screen people who are at high risk because they have a strong family history or specific risk factors for a particular cancer.
Help diagnose. In a person who has symptoms, tumor markers may be used to help detect the presence of cancer and help differentiate it from other conditions with similar symptoms.
Stage. If a person does have cancer, tumor marker elevations can be used to help determine whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) to other tissues and organs and to what extent.
Determine prognosis. Some tumor markers can be used to help determine how aggressive a cancer is likely to be.
Guide choice of treatment. A few tumor markers provide information about which treatments might be effective against a person's cancer. This is a growing area of research. For more information, see the article Genetic Tests for Targeted Cancer Therapy.
Monitor success of treatment and detect recurrence. Tumor markers can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment, especially in advanced cancers. If the marker level drops, the treatment is working; if it stays elevated, adjustments are needed. (The information must be used with care, however, since other conditions can sometimes cause tumor markers to rise or fall.) One of the most important uses for tumor markers, along with guiding treatment, is to monitor for cancer recurrence. If a tumor marker is elevated before treatment, low after treatment, and then begins to rise over time, then it is likely that the cancer is returning. (If it remains elevated after surgery, then chances are that not all of the cancer was removed.) Examples of tumor markers that are used in each of these ways are provided in the table below."

CGM measures glucose every few minutes to track changes in glucose levels in real time. Blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels are not exactly the same, but they mirror each other closely.
Glucose is the primary energy source for the body's cells and the only short-term energy source for the brain and nervous system. A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.
During digestion, the carbohydrates that you eat are broken down into glucose (and other nutrients). They are absorbed by the digestive tract, move into the blood and circulate throughout the body. Normally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and the hormone insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response. The amount of insulin released corresponds to the size and content of the meal. Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. As glucose moves into the cells and is broken down (metabolized), the blood glucose level drops and the pancreas responds by decreasing the release of insulin.
If the glucose/insulin blood feedback system is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the feedback system is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance by increasing insulin production.
Diabetes is the most common disease resulting from an imbalance between glucose and insulin. Type 1 diabetes results when the body is not able to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels. Usually in type 1 diabetes, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells) have been destroyed by the person's own immune system. Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance (the body does not react normally to insulin) and a relative decline in insulin production.
People with diabetes who use insulin to help control blood glucose levels must self-check their blood glucose several times a day. Traditionally, this has been done using fingersticks, and then adjusting their insulin doses based upon the glucose readings. This can add up to many needle sticks a day. Also, this type of monitoring provides glucose readings only at the time of testing and not continuously.
CGM has been developed to give you and your healthcare practitioner a better understanding of how your glucose levels vary throughout the day. It gives you an opportunity to gain better control of your blood glucose, with fewer incidences of high and low sugars and a more timely response to them.
Different versions of CGM devices are available and they are continuing to improve. CGM devices are intended primarily for people with type 1 diabetes but are also being used by some people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin. They are FDA approved for use in adults and teens and some are approved for use in children.
CGM Devices
Some features of CGM devices include: A device with a small sensor wire that is inserted beneath the skin of the abdomen or the upper arm and then held in place by an adhesive patch. This CGM device stays in place for several days (7, 10, or 14). One device has a sensor that is implanted in the upper arm for up to 3 months with a transmitter above it on top of the skin. When the time limits have been met, the CGM devices are removed and another new device is attached/implanted.
The CGM device measures interstitial glucose every few minutes and sends it to a receiver or in some cases to a smart phone or tablet. The devices can store the data, then download it. Software can be used to create reports of the data that can then be evaluated by the person and by a healthcare practitioner.
Most CGM devices measure and display glucose ""real-time"" readings automatically at set intervals, while some display the last glucose result performed when they are scanned (intermittent scanning or flash).
CGM devices may send alerts and have alarms. They may indicate when glucose is high or low, or give alerts based on trend data – such as the glucose is decreasing and likely to be low within the next 60 minutes.
Personal CGM devices provide the results to the person wearing the device and may also be set up to provide the results to several other people at the same time, such as sending alerts and results to a parent or healthcare practitioner as text messages.
Professional CGM devices may be masked, in which case they collect the data but do not show it real-time to the person wearing the device. Data is downloaded by the healthcare practitioner, then discussed with the patient. Unmasked versions collect this data but also have a display that the person can read.  One use of CGM is in conjunction with an insulin pump. When you eat and your glucose level rises, your CGM device measures glucose levels. Controls in the insulin pump react to this result to deliver insulin. Originally approved in adults and teens, these systems can now be used in children as young as 7 and are being studied in younger children."

ANAs identify normal proteins in a cell’s nucleus as foreign and dangerous, triggering a process of inflammation in which the body begins to attack itself.
Most people have a small amount of autoantibodies in their blood, and levels of ANAs often increase with age. In fact, up to one-third of healthy adults over 65 years of age may test positive for ANAs. When large amounts of autoantibodies are detected, it may be a sign of an autoimmune disorder."

If prescribed by a doctor, a patient’s health insurance often covers most or all of these costs. Patient’s should discuss the copays, deductibles, and other fees that may be required."

Like other blood tests though, ANA testing isn’t 100% accurate. When interpreting results of ANA testing, there are several important points about test accuracy to keep in mind: Positive results in healthy patients: Between 3 and 15% of healthy patients may test positive for ANAs. Testing positive is even more common in patients over 65 years of age, with approximately 10 to 37% of patients in this age group testing positive despite not having an autoimmune disorder. A positive ANA test result in a healthy patient is sometimes referred to as a false positive.
Lack of standardization: The level of ANAs that is interpreted as a positive test result varies between laboratories. Some labs may interpret lower levels of ANAs as positive, making this test more sensitive for autoimmune disorders, but also increasing false positive results. Other laboratories may only interpret higher levels of ANAs as positive, increasing the risk of false negative results in which a person tests negative despite having an autoimmune disorder.
Limitations of solid phase assays: Compared to FANA testing, solid phase assays are capable of detecting fewer types of autoantibodies in a blood sample. This limitation means that patients with types of autoantibodies not detected in a solid phase assay may have false negative ANA test results. In order to reduce the risk of inaccurate or false positive results, doctors limit ANA testing to patients who have signs and symptoms of having an autoimmune disorder. If doctors order ANA testing for patients without symptoms, there is an increased risk of false positive test results."

Specific follow-up tests depend on the results of an ANA test, as well as the results of other tests and a patient’s symptoms.
Follow-up testing may involve a solid phase assay, if not already conducted as part of an ANA panel, and other blood tests to detect antibodies specific to individual autoimmune disorders. An extractable nuclear antigen antibodies (ENA) panel is one test used to identify specific autoantibodies.
Additional follow-up blood tests may include a rheumatoid factor test, a cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody test, testing for infections (including hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing), creatine kinase testing, and urine protein to creatinine testing.
If a patient tests negative for ANA, but the patient’s doctor continues to suspect an autoimmune disorder, follow-up testing may be recommended. Follow-up tests after a negative result may include biopsies, diagnostic imaging tests, and blood tests similar to those used in patients who test positive for ANA.

They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, and allergic reactions. The white blood cell (WBC) count totals the number of white blood cells in a sample of your blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC), which is often used in the general evaluation of your health.
Blood is made up of three main types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to WBCs, there are red blood cells and platelets. All of these cells are made in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate.
There are five types of WBCs, and each has a different function: Three types of WBCs are referred to as ""granulocytes"" because of the granules present in their cytoplasm. These granules release chemicals and other substances as part of the immune response. Granulocytes include:
Neutrophils (neu) normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue, where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi.
Eosinophils (eos) respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation.
Basophils (baso) usually make up the fewest number of circulating WBCs and are thought to be involved in allergic reactions.
Lymphocytes (lymphs) exist in both the blood and the lymphatic system. They are divided into three types:
B lymphocytes (B cells) produce antibodies as part of the body’s natural defense (immune) responses.
T lymphocytes (T cells) recognize foreign substances and process them for removal.
Natural killer cells (NK cells) directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.
Monocytes (mono), similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated more often with chronic rather than acute infections. When there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs, releasing them into the blood, and through a complex process, they move to the site of infection or inflammation. As the condition resolves, the production of WBCs by the bone marrow subsides and the number of WBCs drops to normal levels again.
In addition to infections and inflammation, there are a number of conditions that can affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or the survival of WBCs in the blood, such as cancer or an immune disorder, resulting in either increased or decreased numbers of WBCs in the blood. The WBC count, along with the other components of the CBC, alerts a healthcare practitioner to possible health issues. Results are often interpreted in conjunction with additional tests, such as a WBC differential and a blood smear review. A differential may provide information on which type of WBC may be low or high, and a blood smear may show the presence of abnormal and/or immature WBCs.
If results indicate a problem, a wide variety of other tests can be performed to help determine the cause. A healthcare practitioner will typically consider an individual's signs and symptoms, medical history, and results of a physical examination to decide what other tests may be necessary. For example, as needed, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to evaluate the bone marrow status."

In the early stages of infection, there may not be any noticeable signs or symptoms of disease or only flu-like symptoms, although the virus is usually present in high amounts. Without treatment and even when there are no symptoms, the virus continues to replicate and the viral load will increase. HIV kills your CD4 cells, so the number of CD4 cells will decrease as HIV infection progresses.
About 3-8 weeks after initial exposure to the virus, your immune system begins to produce HIV antibodies in response to the infection and suppresses the HIV viral load, decreasing it to a low level. Initial symptoms typically resolve, but your infection does not go away.
The only way to determine whether you have been infected is through HIV testing. If not detected early and treated, an HIV infection may slowly degrade your immune system. After several years and without treatment, the immune system can become so weakened that the disease begins to affect your ability to fight infections and certain cancers. Symptoms of AIDS begin to appear at this stage as your body becomes more susceptible to infections with microorganisms such as tuberculosis and fungi or other diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma.
When you are diagnosed, you are given antiretroviral treatments for HIV (also called highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART) to suppress the amount of HIV virus present in your blood, limiting its ability to replicate and reducing the risk of progressing to AIDS. Evidence shows that keeping the viral load at undetectable levels decreases your risk of progressing to AIDS and greatly improves your long-term health. If you have HIV and discontinues treatment or if it loses its effectiveness, then your HIV viral load can begin to increase again.
The HIV RNA test detects HIV virus genetic material and measures how many copies of HIV (viral load) are present in your blood at a particular time. It can track increases and decreases in your HIV viral load and, in conjunction with a CD4 count, be used to evaluate treatment effectiveness."

Laboratory tests detect the presence and measure the quantity of specific thyroid autoantibodies in the blood.
The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that lies flat against the windpipe in the throat. The primary hormones that it produces, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are vital in helping to regulate the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism). The body uses a feedback system in which thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates the thyroid to produce T4 and T3 as needed. This system helps maintain a relatively stable amount of the thyroid hormones in the blood. When thyroid antibodies interfere with this process, they can lead to chronic conditions and autoimmune disorders associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, such as Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Thyroid antibody tests include: Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)
Thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb)

Knowing whether the cancer has a particular mutation can help guide the type of treatment that a person receives. The presence or absence of certain mutations can predict who may benefit from certain drugs and who is not likely to respond.
Cancer is the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. Multiple factors may contribute to this uncontrolled growth. One such factor is the malfunctioning of proteins involved in controlling cell growth and maturation. The proteins usually malfunction as a result of a mutation in the DNA of the gene that codes for that protein. Some mutations may result in a defective protein that cannot stop cell growth while other mutations may produce a protein with altered function that stimulates cell growth. The net result is unchecked growth and division of these abnormal cells (cancer).
Medical researchers have long studied these changes in genes in order to better understand cancer and to develop drugs to fight it. Their goal has been to create drugs that disrupt a specific step in cancer growth, while doing minimal damage to normal cells. These are called targeted drugs or targeted therapy. What researchers have noted is that specific types of cancer are frequently associated with specific genetic mutations. Not every cancer will have them, but a significant percentage will, and cancers with these mutations usually have a more predictable response to certain drug treatments compared to cancers without these mutations.
These findings have led to two important developments: Cancer drugs that inhibit or target very specific proteins associated with certain cancers (Two examples are tyrosine kinase inhibitors and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies.)
Genetic tests to detect the presence of mutations in cancer tissue that tell a healthcare practitioner whether the person being tested is likely to benefit from a specific therapy Medical researchers continue to explore the genetics of cancer and to look for opportunities to develop new therapies. Additionally, some cancers eventually stop responding to certain therapies and develop resistance to that therapy. Genetic research may offer insights into how resistance to therapy occurs."

This test evaluates a person's DNA to determine what combination of APOE forms (genotype) is present. The APOE gene exists in three different forms (alleles) – e2, e3, and e4 – with e3 being the most common allele, found in 60% of the general population. Everyone inherits a pair of APOE genes that is some combination of these three.
APOE e4 has been associated with an increased risk of late onset Alzheimer disease (AD), that is AD that develops after the age of 65. This effect is additive in that one copy of e4 (e2/e4 or e3/e4) carries some increased risk and two copies of e4 (e4/e4) are associated with even more of a risk of developing AD. It is important to note, however, that we are talking about the risk relative to other people at the same age with fewer copies of e4.

For this reason, APOE genotyping is referred to as susceptibility or risk factor testing since it indicates whether there is an increased risk of AD but is not specifically diagnostic of AD.

This protein promotes cell growth and division and is especially important for controlling blood cell production within the bone marrow. This test looks for mutations in JAK2 that are associated with bone marrow disorders caused by the production of too many blood cells.
The bone marrow disorders caused by JAK2 mutations are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in which the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells, red blood cells, and/or platelets. Some of the MPNs most commonly associated with JAK2 mutations are: Polycythemia vera (PV)—the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells
Essential thrombocythemia (ET)—there are too many platelet-producing cells (megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia—there are too many platelet-producing cells and cells that produce scar tissue in the bone marrow The primary JAK2 test is JAK2 V617F, named for a mutation at a specific location in the JAK2 gene. JAK2 V617F mutation is acquired as opposed to inherited and results in the change of a single DNA nucleotide base pair. In JAK2, this kind of mutation, called a point mutation, replaces the normal amino acid valine (abbreviated V) with phenylalanine (abbreviated F). This amino acid change results in a JAK2 protein that is constantly ""on,"" leading to uncontrolled blood cell production.
Other mutations in the JAK2 gene are also associated with MPNs. Over 50 different mutations have been identified. There are tests available to detect mutations in JAK2 exon 12 and to identify other non-V617F mutations."

This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of SMA (or antibody against actin) in the blood.
The production of smooth muscle or actin antibodies is strongly associated with autoimmune hepatitis. It may also sometimes be seen in other forms of liver disease, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), but usually at lower antibody titers.
Autoimmune hepatitis occurs when the immune system attacks the body's liver cells. It presents as an acute or chronic inflammation of the liver that is not due to another cause, such as a viral infection, exposure to a drug or toxin, a hereditary disorder, or alcohol abuse. It can lead to liver cirrhosis and, in some cases, to liver failure. Autoimmune hepatitis can affect anyone at any age, but about 80% of patients are women. In the United States, more than 70% of people with this disorder will have SMA or actin antibodies, either alone or along with antinuclear antibodies (ANA).
The majority of smooth muscle antibodies produced with autoimmune hepatitis is specifically directed against a protein called actin or F-actin. Testing is available for specific actin autoantibodies, but it is not available in every laboratory. Tests for actin antibodies detect more cases of autoimmune hepatitis but, in some studies, give more false-positive results than tests for smooth muscle antibodies."

Consuming these foods can cause various symptoms including upset stomach, bloating, and other gastrointestinal problems.
Food sensitivities and intolerances are not the same as food allergies. The central difference is that true allergies are caused by an overreaction of the immune system.
With food sensitivities and intolerances, reactions are normally predictable and increase based on how much of the food is consumed. In contrast, allergic reactions can have unpredictable severity and often occur with minuscule levels of exposure or even just contact with the skin.
Examples of food sensitivities and intolerances include:  Lactose intolerance
Non-celiac gluten sensitivity
Caffeine intolerance
Alcohol sensitivity
Intolerance to food additives like sulfites
Intolerance to FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols)"

Testing for a wide range of possible reactions can return a false positive, which means the test shows an intolerance or sensitivity for a food that doesn’t actually cause you problems. False positives can cause unnecessary changes to your diet that may affect your nutrition.

It is part of a feedback loop that includes calcium, PTH, vitamin D, and, to some extent, phosphorus (phosphate) and magnesium. Conditions and diseases that disrupt this feedback loop can cause inappropriate elevations or decreases in calcium and PTH levels and lead to symptoms of hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia. This test measures the amount of PTH in the blood.
PTH is produced by four button-sized parathyroid glands that are located in the neck behind the thyroid gland. Normally, these glands secrete PTH into the bloodstream in response to low blood calcium levels. The hormone works in three ways to help raise blood calcium levels back to normal (two are direct and one is indirect): PTH directly promotes the release of calcium from bones into the bloodstream.
It directly acts on the kidneys to reduce the elimination of calcium in the urine while promoting the elimination of phosphorus in the urine.
The indirect effect stimulates the kidneys to convert vitamin D from the inactive to the active form, which in turn increases the absorption of calcium from food in the intestines. As calcium levels begin to increase in the blood, PTH normally decreases.
Parathyroid hormone itself is composed of 84 amino acids (sometimes called PTH (1-84)). Intact and fragmented hormone is present in and secreted by the parathyroid gland. The intact hormone represents a smaller fraction, but its portion is increased when calcium levels are low and decreased when calcium levels are high.
Once released into the bloodstream, PTH has a very short life span; levels fall by half in less than 5 minutes due to uptake and cleavage in the liver and kidneys. The fragments are referred to as C-terminal fragments and are variably sized, missing anywhere from 6 amino acids to more than half the N-terminal portion of the molecule. C-terminal fragments have a longer half-life, exist in much higher concentrations, and are eventually cleared by the kidneys.
Although it was originally thought that the C-terminal fragments were inactive, it now appears that certain fragments may have biologic activities that are able to oppose those of intact PTH."

The drug is prescribed as a secondary (adjunctive) treatment in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. This test measures the level of levetiracetam in the blood.
Epilepsy affects the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, a person may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to occasional seizures, to recurrent seizures. Seizures are categorized by the parts of the brain and body that are affected. Levetiracetam is prescribed to help prevent specific types of recurrent seizures.
Levetiracetam is one of several newer second-generation antiepileptic drugs. It has a wider therapeutic range than many existing first-generation seizure medications. That is, the range of concentration in the blood in which the drug is effective without being toxic is broader, making it somewhat safer. It is also associated with fewer severe side effects and does not interact with as many other drugs. Levetiracetam provides a combination of effectiveness and safety that is superior to other treatment choices in many clinical circumstances.
Because levetiracetam has a wider therapeutic range, it does not need to be monitored in the same manner as first-generation antiepileptic drugs. (For further discussion of this, see the article on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.)
At the start of therapy, doses of levetiracetam may be gradually increased until a standard amount is reached. Once a stable dose is achieved, a blood level may be measured to ensure that it is within the therapeutic range. Since levetiracetam is an adjunct (secondary) medication, the healthcare practitioner will consider the effectiveness of both drugs that are prescribed and adjust them as necessary."

Ultrasound is typically used to estimate the amount of amniotic fluid that is present. Too little amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) occurs in approximately 11% of all pregnancies. It is most commonly caused by leaking of amniotic fluid due to a tear in the amniotic sac (premature rupture of the membranes), but it can also be caused by an abnormality of the fetal kidneys and/or urinary tract. If the fetal kidneys are not functioning normally, they will not produce enough urine to replace what the fetus swallows, and if there is a blockage of the urinary tract, it can prevent the urine from cycling back out to the amniotic fluid sac. Pregnancies affected by oligohydramnios are at higher risk for adverse fetal outcomes and should be monitored with care."

Care must be taken in the sample collection process to ensure that the sample is from the lower airways and not from the upper respiratory tract. Sputum samples may be expectorated or induced (See the section below on sample collection.)
Bacterial sputum cultures detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria (pathogens) in people who are suspected of having bacterial pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract infections. Bacteria in the sample are identified and susceptibility testing is performed to guide antibiotic treatment.
Sometimes a respiratory infection is caused by a pathogen that cannot be grown and identified with a routine bacterial sputum culture. Other tests, such as an AFB smear and culture, fungal culture, or viral culture, may be ordered in addition to or instead of a routine culture.
Typically, the first step in the routine analysis of a sputum sample is a Gram stain to identify the general type of bacteria that may be present. The sample is then placed on or in appropriate nutrient media and incubated. The media encourages the growth of bacteria that are present, allowing for further testing and identification.
Sputum is not sterile. That means that when a person has a bacterial respiratory infection, there will typically be harmless bacteria that are normally present in the mouth, throat, etc. (normal flora) as well as disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria present.
A trained laboratorian differentiates normal flora from pathogenic bacteria and identifies the various types of bacteria present in the culture. Identification is a step-by-step process that may involve several biochemical, immunological, and/or molecular tests and observations of the organism's growth characteristics.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is frequently required to guide the treatment and to determine whether the bacteria present are likely to respond to specific antibiotics.
The sputum culture, Gram stain(s), and susceptibility testing all contribute to a report that informs the health practitioner which pathogen(s) are present and which antibiotic therapies are likely to inhibit their growth."

Samples that are coughed up are expelled into a sterile cup provided by the laboratory. Deep coughing is generally required, and the person should be informed that it is phlegm/mucus from the lungs that is necessary, not saliva. If someone cannot produce a sputum sample, then it can often be induced by following instructions provided and inhaling a sterile saline or glycerin aerosol for several minutes to loosen phlegm in the lungs. Steam inhalation or a hot shower can also be useful in loosening the phlegm. Sometimes, induction of sputum might be assisted by a respiratory therapist technician.
All samples collected should be taken to the laboratory promptly for processing while they are fresh. Sputum samples must be evaluated and accepted by the laboratory before they are processed.
Useful sputum culture results rely heavily on good sample collection. If examination of a Gram stain of the sample reveals that it contains a significant number of normal cells that line the mouth (squamous epithelial cells), then the sample is not generally considered adequate for culture and a re-collection of the sample may be required. If the sample contains a majority of white blood cells that indicate a body's response to an infection, then it is considered to be an adequate sample for culturing."

It is a critical part of hemoglobin, the protein in RBCs that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it as blood circulates to other parts of the body. The serum iron test measures the amount of iron in the liquid portion of blood.
Serum iron is almost always measured with other iron tests, such as serum ferritin, transferrin and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload.
The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements. Once absorbed, it is transported throughout the body by binding to transferrin, a protein produced by the liver.
In healthy people, most of the iron absorbed is incorporated into the hemoglobin inside RBCs. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the iron level in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because: Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease
There is an increased need for iron, such as during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer) Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron-deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to develop. The most common symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. (Read the article on Anemia to learn more.)
On the other hand, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron blood levels and iron storage increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron can lead to progressive accumulation and damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a genetic disease in which the body absorbs too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overdose can occur when someone consumes more than the recommended amount of iron."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/vitamin-a,Vitamin A,[],['Retinol'],"May 28, 2020.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many of the foods we eat. Retinol is the primary form of vitamin A in humans. This test measures the level of retinol in the blood.
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for healthy vision and skin, bone formation, immune system function, and reproduction. It is required to produce photoreceptors in the eyes and to maintain the lining of the surface of the eyes and other mucous membranes. A lack of vitamin A can affect night vision, cause eye damage, and in severe cases, lead to blindness. Too much vitamin A can be toxic, causing a range of symptoms, and sometimes leading to birth defects.
The body cannot make vitamin A and must rely on dietary sources of vitamin A. Meat sources provide vitamin A (as retinol), while vegetable and fruit sources provide carotene (a substance that can be converted into vitamin A by the liver). Vitamin A is stored in the liver and fat tissues (it is fat-soluble), and healthy adults may have as much as a year's worth stored. The body maintains a relatively stable level in the blood through a feedback system that releases vitamin A from storage as needed and increases or decreases the efficiency of dietary vitamin A absorption.
Deficiencies in vitamin A are rare in the United States, but they are a major health problem in as many as half of all countries, especially in resource-poor nations where high numbers of people have limited diets, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness. Young children and pregnant women are most commonly affected, say the WHO.
In the U.S., vitamin A deficiencies are primarily seen in those with malnutrition, chronic diarrhea, malabsorption disorders such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, or chronic pancreatitis, in the elderly, and in those with alcoholism, liver disease and blockage of the bile ducts. Surgery either on the intestine or pancreas can have the similar consequences.
Vitamin A deficiency is a risk factor for severe measles; treatment with vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and may reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.
Vitamin A toxicity occurs primarily from overuse of vitamin supplements. However, it can sometimes occur when the diet includes a high proportion of foods that are high in vitamin A, such as liver."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/sirolimus,Sirolimus,['Rapamycin'],[],"January 18, 2019.","January 14, 2020.",What is being tested?,"Sirolimus, also called rapamycin, is a drug that is used to suppress the immune system in people who have had kidney transplants. It is given in combination with other drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys. This test measures the amount of sirolimus in the blood.
Normally, a person's immune system recognizes a transplanted organ as foreign and begins to attack it. Sirolimus limits this response and helps to prevent organ rejection by inhibiting the activation and production of white blood cells called T-lymphocytes. It also inhibits antibody production.
Sirolimus is typically taken by mouth (orally) and, after ingestion, is absorbed from the digestive tract. The drug's concentration peaks in the blood in approximately two hours and then gradually declines. It is metabolized by the liver and in the gut and is eliminated from the body in the stool (more than 90%) and urine (less than 2%).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has currently approved sirolimus for use in people 13 years of age and older who have kidney transplants to prevent acute rejection. It appears to be less toxic to the kidneys than other options and can be given in conjunction with the other immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Studies to evaluate its use in other age groups and types of organ transplantation, such as liver or lung, are ongoing, but so far, no data have convinced the FDA that sirolimus is appropriate for children under 13. Like other immunosuppressant agents, sirolimus may cause side effects and adverse reactions and is associated with an increased risk of infection and the development of lymphoma and skin cancer.
The sirolimus level must be monitored over time with laboratory tests because the drug has a narrow therapeutic index, which is the range between minimal effective concentration and minimum toxic concentration. If the drug concentration is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, symptoms associated with toxicity may develop, such as low platelet, low white blood cell, and high triglyceride levels. The sirolimus blood test is usually measured as a ""trough"" level, with blood collection just prior to the next dose – at the drug's lowest concentration in the blood.
Typically, sirolimus is given with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Dosages must be tailored to the individual, and sirolimus and cyclosporine must both be monitored. Often, people will begin with an initial higher dose (loading dose) of sirolimus and then are tapered to a lower dose. In people considered at low risk for complications, cyclosporine may be decreased or stopped after 2-4 months and sirolimus concentrations will be increased."
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/sirolimus,Sirolimus,['Rapamycin'],[],"January 18, 2019.","January 14, 2020.",How is it used?,The sirolimus test is used to monitor the level of the drug over time in kidney transplant recipients who are taking the drug to prevent organ rejection. This test measures the amount of drug in the blood to determine whether the concentration is within the therapeutic range and is below the toxic level. Treatment with sirolimus must be monitored because the range in which the drug is effective but not toxic is very narrow.
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/sirolimus,Sirolimus,['Rapamycin'],[],"January 18, 2019.","January 14, 2020.",When is it ordered?,"Sirolimus is ordered frequently at the start of therapy when the drug concentration reaches an equilibrium (stead state) in the blood. Because of the long time that it takes to clear the drug from the body (its long half-life), the sirolimus concentration may take several days to settle at a steady state. Once dosages have been optimized for the individual and are well tolerated, then the frequency of sirolimus testing may be reduced."

B12 and folate work with vitamin C to help the body make new proteins. They are necessary for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation, repair of tissues and cells, and synthesis of DNA. Both are nutrients that cannot be produced in the body and must be supplied by the diet.
Vitamin B12 and folate tests measure vitamin levels in the liquid portion of the blood (serum or plasma) to detect deficiencies. Sometimes the amount of folate inside red blood cells may also be measured. Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is found in foods from animals, such as red meat, fish, poultry, milk, yogurt, and eggs.
Folate (Vitamin B9) refers to a natural occurring form of the vitamin, whereas folic acid refers to the supplement added to foods and drinks. Folate is found in leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, dry beans and peas, liver, and yeast. In recent years, fortified cereals, breads, and other grain products have also become important dietary sources of B12 and folate (identified as ""folic acid"" on nutritional labels).
A deficiency in either B12 or folate can lead to macrocytic anemia, where red blood cells are larger than normal. Megaloblastic anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia, is characterized by the production of fewer but larger RBCs called macrocytes, in addition to some cellular changes in the bone marrow. Other laboratory findings associated with megaloblastic anemia include decreased WBC count, RBC count, reticulocyte count, and platelet count.
B12 is also important for nerve health and a deficiency can lead to varying degrees of neuropathy, nerve damage that can cause tingling and numbness in the affected person's hands and feet.
Folate is necessary for cell division such as is seen in a developing fetus. Folate deficiency during early pregnancy can increase the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida in a growing fetus.
B12 and folate deficiencies are most often caused by not getting enough of the vitamins through the diet or supplements, long-term use of certain medications, inadequate absorption, or by increased need as seen in pregnancy: Dietary deficiencies—these are uncommon in the United States because many foods and drinks are supplemented with these vitamins, which are stored by the body. Adults typically have several years' worth of vitamin B12 stored in the liver and about 3 months of stored folate. Dietary deficiencies do not usually cause symptoms until stores of the vitamins within the body have been depleted. B12 deficiencies are sometimes seen in vegans (those who do not consume any animal products) and in their breast-fed infants.
Inadequate absorption—vitamin B12 absorption occurs in a series of steps. B12 is normally released from food by stomach acid and then, in the small intestine, is bound to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein made by parietal cells in the stomach. This B12-IF complex is then absorbed by the small intestine, bound by carrier proteins (transcobalamins), and enters the circulation. If a disease or condition interferes with any of these steps, then B12 absorption is impaired.
Increased need—this can be seen with a variety of diseases and conditions. Increased demand for folate occurs when a woman is pregnant or nursing, in early childhood, with cancers, or with chronic hemolytic anemias. For more, see the article on Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiencies."

High amounts of SMRP are often seen in the blood of people suffering from mesothelioma, and the amount of SMRP in the blood is thought to be related to the extent of disease. This test measures the amount of SMRP in the blood.
Malignant mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the membranes that cover the outside of internal organs and line body cavities, including the chest (pleural mesothelioma), abdominal cavity (peritoneal mesothelioma), and the heart (pericardial mesothelioma). About 3,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the U.S., and pleural mesothelioma is the most common type, accounting for 90% of all cases.
Malignant mesotheliomas can also be classified based on the type of cell found: Epithelioid cell type (line body cavities): accounts for 50-70% of mesotheliomas; tends to be associated with a better prognosis than the other types.
Sarcomatoid cell type: accounts for about 10% of mesotheliomas and is the most difficult to treat.
Mixed (biphasic): has both epithelioid and sarcomatoid areas; accounts for up to 40% of mesotheliomas. Most cases of pleural mesothelioma—about 70% to 80%—arise in people with a history of working with asbestos, especially in the shipbuilding, construction, automotive, and fireproofing industries. The disease has a long latency period, meaning that people usually develop mesothelioma 20 to 50 years after asbestos exposure."

Testing for LDL-C often involves using a formula to calculate the amount of LDL-C in blood based on results of a lipid panel. Sometimes, LDL-C is measured directly.
Monitoring and maintaining appropriate levels of cholesterol and other lipids is important for staying healthy. A diet high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats), or an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
High LDL-C is considered to be undesirable and LDL-C is often called ""bad"" cholesterol because it is associated with cholesterol plaques, atheroslcerosis, and heart disease. This is in contrast to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that tend to transport cholesterol from the arteries to the liver. High HDL-C is thought to protect against heart disease and so it is often called ""good"" cholesterol."

This makes the test useful as a tumor marker in specific circumstances. The CA-125 test measures the amount of CA-125 protein in your blood.
Significantly elevated concentrations of CA-125 may be present in the blood of a woman who has ovarian cancer. Thus, the test may be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and/or for recurrence of the cancer. However, not all women with ovarian cancer will have elevated CA-125 so the test may not be useful in all cases.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the lifetime risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 78 and the lifetime risk of death is 1 in 108. ACS estimates that in 2019 about 22,530 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. and about 13,980 women will die of it.
Currently, less than 20% of ovarian cancers are found in the early stages before they have spread outside the ovary. The primary reason they go undetected is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly non-specific.
The need for a reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women continues to drive ongoing research. In the meantime, regular physicals, pelvic exams, and an awareness of your family history and symptoms are important.
CA-125 is not recommended as a screening test for asymptomatic women because it is non-specific. Small quantities of CA-125 are produced by normal tissues throughout your body and by some other cancers. Levels in your blood may be moderately elevated with a variety of non-cancerous conditions, including menstruation, pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease."

It is produced by special cells in the thyroid called C-cells. The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. Besides calcitonin, the thyroid produces other hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and some triiodothyronine (T3), that help control the rate of metabolism.
In two rare conditions, C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), excess amounts of calcitonin are produced. The calcitonin test measures the level in the blood and may be used to detect and monitor these conditions. C-cell hyperplasia is a benign condition that causes abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid. It may or may not progress to become medullary thyroid cancer.
Medullary thyroid cancer is malignant – it can spread beyond the thyroid and can be difficult to treat if it is not discovered early. Medullary cancer is a rare form of thyroid cancer that accounts for about 4% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. Approximately 52,000 people are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, and about 2,000 people die of the disease.
About 75% of medullary thyroid cancer cases are sporadic, occurring in people who do not have a family history of the disease. Most sporadic cases develop when people are in their 40s or 50s and are more common in women than men.
Up to 25% of cases of MTC are related to an inherited variant (mutation) in the RET gene that leads to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2 is a syndrome associated with several related diseases, including medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytomas. The RET gene variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This means you only need to inherit one copy of the gene variant from either your father or mother to have a greatly increased risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer. This inherited form affects both men and women equally and can occur at a younger age. (For more details, see the article on Thyroid Cancer.)"

GGT is elevated in the blood in most diseases that cause damage to the liver or bile ducts. This test measures the level of GGT in a blood sample.
Normally, GGT is present in low levels, but when the liver is injured, the GGT level can rise. GGT is usually the first liver enzyme to rise in the blood when any of the bile ducts that carry bile from the liver to the intestines become obstructed, for example, by tumors or stones. This makes it the most sensitive liver enzyme test for detecting bile duct problems.
However, the GGT test is not very specific and is not useful in differentiating between various causes of liver damage because it can be elevated with many types of liver diseases, such as liver cancer and viral hepatitis, as well as other non-hepatic conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome. For this reason, the GGT test is not recommended for routine use by itself. However, it can be useful in conjunction with other tests and in determining the cause of a high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, another enzyme found in the liver.
Both GGT and ALP are increased in liver diseases, but only ALP will be increased with diseases affecting bone tissue. Therefore, GGT can be used as a follow up to an elevated ALP to help determine if the high ALP result is due to liver or bone disease.
GGT levels are sometimes increased with consumption of even small amounts of alcohol. Higher levels are found more commonly in chronic heavy drinkers than in people who consume less than 2 to 3 drinks per day or who only drink heavily on occasion (binge drinkers). The GGT test may be used in evaluating someone for acute or chronic alcohol abuse."

They form the structural part of most organs and make up enzymes and some hormones that regulate bodily functions. Protein electrophoresis is a lab method that separates proteins based on their size and electrical charge. Knowing which proteins are present, absent, elevated, or decreased in body fluids such as blood can help diagnose and/or monitor various diseases and conditions.
Body fluids, such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contain many different proteins that have various roles, such as transporting nutrients, removing toxins, and controlling body functions.
The two major types of proteins are: Albumin is produced in the liver and accounts for about 60% of the protein in the blood.
Globulins is a collective term used to refer to proteins other than albumin. With the exception of antibodies (immunoglobulins) and some complement proteins, most of the globulins are also produced in the liver. The various proteins in body fluids are subjected to a controlled electric current, fractionating them into a typical pattern of bands or peaks that then can be measured. The proteins are divided into six groups, called prealbumin (rarely detected on serum or urine protein electrophoresis), albumin, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma. The beta fraction may be further divided into beta 1 and beta 2 subgroups.
Each of these protein groups (electrophoresis fractions) is distinct and at specific concentrations. The patterns typically seen in certain conditions and diseases can help with diagnosis. The major serum proteins and their functions are listed according to their electrophoretic region or fraction (the visible band that they are part of) in the table titled Protein Groups.
Various conditions and diseases can affect protein production and/or protein loss, thus changing the pattern of bands seen on a protein electrophoresis. The most important example is the appearance of a distinct, monoclonal band in the gamma region. For example, uncontrolled growth and division of a malignant plasma cell as seen in multiple myeloma leads to the production of large amounts of a single type of immunoglobulin (monoclonal immunoglobulin).
When an abnormal protein (band or peak) is detected, additional tests are done to identify the type of protein (immunotyping). Immunofixation electrophoresis or immunosubtraction electrophoresis can be used to identify abnormal bands seen on protein electrophoresis, typically in the gamma region, in order to determine whether a type of antibody (immunoglobulin) is abnormally produced (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM).
In most cases of multiple myeloma, a single type of intact (whole) immunoglobulin is produced in excess. In a minority of cases, only one section of an immunoglobulin called a ""free light chain"" is produced in large amounts. These excess free light chains are released into the bloodstream and since they are relatively small molecules, they are filtered by the kidneys and released into the urine. Another term for these excess free light chains in the urine is Bence Jones proteins."

Early in pregnancy, the level of hCG increases in the blood and is eliminated in the urine. A pregnancy test detects hCG in the blood or urine and confirms or rules out pregnancy.
During the early weeks of pregnancy, hCG is important in maintaining function of the corpus luteum. Production of hCG increases steadily during the first trimester (8-10 weeks) of a normal pregnancy, peaking around the 10th week after the last menstrual cycle. Levels then fall slowly during the remainder of the pregnancy. hCG is no longer detectable within a few weeks after delivery.
When a pregnancy occurs outside of the uterus (ectopic), the level of hCG in the blood increases at a slower rate. When an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, measuring the level of hCG in the blood (quantitative test) over time may be useful in helping to make a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
Similarly, the hCG blood level may be abnormal when the developing baby (fetus) has a chromosome defect such as Down syndrome. An hCG test is used routinely in conjunction with a few other tests as part of screening for fetal abnormalities between 11 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. (See First Trimester Down Syndrome Screen or Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screening for more on this.)"

Methods will vary slightly but for most, a test strip is dipped into a collected cup of urine or exposed to a woman's urine stream. A colored line (or other color change) appears within the time allotted per instructions, usually about 5 minutes. For accurate test results, it is important to carefully follow the test directions.

When a person with a cervix should get a Pap smear depends on a variety of factors, including age, health, and history of cervical cancer screening. A healthcare practitioner may also order a Pap smear when a patient is pregnant.
Cervical cancer screening may involve a Pap smear, an HPV test, or cotesting with both tests at the same time. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends regular cervical cancer screening between ages 21 and 65: Ages 21 to 29: Most people with a cervix between 21 and 29 years old should get screened for cervical cancer every three years with a Pap smear alone.
Ages 30 to 65: For people with a cervix between 30 and 65 years old, there are several options for cervical cancer screening. Individuals in this age group may choose to be screened every three years with a Pap smear alone, every five years with an HPV test alone, or every five years with both a Pap smear and an HPV test. Patients should have a discussion with their healthcare provider about the pros and cons of different screening strategies in order to decide which approach is best for their situation.
Patients may need to be screened for cervical cancer more often if they have one of the following risk factors: A history of abnormal Pap smears
HIV
A mother who was exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) while pregnant
A weakened immune system Other groups do not need regular cervical cancer screening. These groups include: Patients who are under 21 years of age
Patients who are older than 65, have had adequate screening in the past, and are not at an increased risk of cervical cancer
People who have had a hysterectomy and who do not have a history of abnormal Pap smears or cervical cancer"

For individuals undergoing screening for cervical cancer who have a normal Pap smear result, it’s important to continue cancer screening at regular intervals.
People who receive abnormal Pap smear results require follow-up tests and/or treatment in order to further assess the cervix for signs of disease. For minor abnormalities such as ASC-US, a doctor may recommend a human papillomavirus (HPV) test and/or having another Pap smear in a year to see if the abnormality resolves without treatment.
For a result of LSIL, a doctor may recommend additional testing to look for more serious abnormalities on another portion of the cervix.
If a patient has more severe abnormalities, including ASC-H or HSIL a doctor may recommend a colposcopy. A colposcopy is a procedure that involves the use of an instrument called a colposcope to more closely examine the cervix. Doctors may perform a biopsy during a colposcopy to remove additional tissue for examination.

It gives relatively quick results as to whether bacteria or fungi are present and, if so, the general type(s).
The Gram stain involves applying a sample from the infected area onto a glass slide and allowing it to dry. The slide is then treated with a special stain and examined under a microscope by a trained laboratorian. Any bacteria that may be present are categorized by color and shape during the microscopic evaluation: Color — typically bacteria may be either ""Gram positive"" (purple) or ""Gram negative"" (pink)
Shape — the most common shapes include round (cocci) or rod-shaped (bacilli) Additional information may be obtained by observing the groupings of the bacteria on the slide, such as cocci that are present singly, in pairs, in groups of four, in clusters or in chains, or bacilli that are thick, thin, short, long, or have enlarged spores on one end. Any bacteria that are present within white blood cells (intracellular) are also noted.
The Gram stain color and the bacterial shape give clues as to what bacteria might be causing the infection. One example of gram-positive cocci is Staphylococcus aureus, the bacteria associated with staph infections. An example of gram-negative bacteria is Escherichia coli, the cause of many urinary tract infections.
Fungi (in the form of yeasts or molds) can also be initially recognized with the Gram stain, but viruses cannot be seen with a Gram stain.
Though Gram stains are useful as initial tests for detecting and identifying general types of bacteria or fungi, results are usually considered preliminary. Results of a culture and/or other tests such as antigen, antibody, or molecular testing for particular types of bacteria are necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Sometimes, susceptibility testing is necessary to determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating the infection."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/t4-free,"T4, Free",['Thyroxine'],['Free Thyroxine'],"November 1, 2018.","April 20, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Thyroxine (T4) is one of two major hormones produced by the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped organ that lies flat across the windpipe at the base of the throat. The other major thyroid hormone is called triiodothyronine (T3) and together they help control the rate at which the body uses energy. Almost all of the T4 (and T3) found in the blood is bound to protein. The rest is free (unbound) and is the biologically active form of the hormone. This test measures the amount of free T4 in the blood.
Most of the hormone produced by the thyroid is T4. This hormone is relatively inactive, but it is converted into the much more active T3 in the liver and other tissues.
T4 levels are regulated by the feedback system that the body uses to maintain stable amounts of thyroid hormones in the blood. T3 and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), along with its regulatory hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which comes from the hypothalamus, are also part of the feedback system. When thyroid hormone levels decrease in the blood, the pituitary gland produces TSH in response to TRH stimulation. TSH in turn stimulates the thyroid by binding to the TSH receptor to produce and release T4 and T3.
When thyroid hormone levels increase in the blood, the pituitary gland produces less TSH, and the thyroid produces less T4 and T3. When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient T4 and T3 (underactive thyroid), due to thyroid dysfunction or to insufficient TSH, then the affected person experiences symptoms of hypothyroidism such as weight gain, dry skin, cold intolerance, irregular menstruation, and fatigue. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. (See the article on Hashimoto thyroiditis for more details.)
If the thyroid gland produces too much T4 and T3, the affected person may experience symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as rapid heart rate, anxiety, weight loss, difficulty sleeping, tremors in the hands, and puffiness around dry, irritated eyes and in some cases, bulging eyes. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. (See the article on Graves disease for more details.)
Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and excessive or deficient production of TSH. The effect of these conditions on thyroid hormone production can be detected and monitored by measuring the free T4."

This test detects ASCA in the blood.
S. cerevisiae are common yeast found in various foods. The correlation between the presence of antibodies to S. cerevisiae and their involvement in the inflammatory bowel disease process is not understood at this time.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders, thought to be due to an autoimmune process, characterized by swollen and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The symptoms and severity of IBD vary from person to person and may fluctuate over time. Many of those affected experience flare-ups followed by periods of lessened symptoms or even remission.
The two most common types of IBD are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD can affect any part of the intestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but is primarily found in the small intestine and/or in the colon, while UC occurs in the colon.
The diagnosis of CD or UC is usually made on the basis of endoscopic testing and the examination of biopsy samples from the intestines. Because both CD and UC can be found in the colon, even using biopsies it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the two. When this occurs, ASCA testing may be helpful as ASCA is much more frequently found in people with CD than in those with UC.
There are two classes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies produced by the body, ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA. Testing usually includes both classes. ASCA IgG may predict the severity of the disease and the need for surgery as a treatment option."

In an individual who has already had kidney stones, an increased level of one of these substances, particularly calcium, can indicate both an elevated risk for developing additional stones and the likely type of stones that would form.
Kidney stone is a term for solid aggregates of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys. Typical kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate (~75% of cases), calcium phosphate (15%), uric acid (8%), struvite (~1%), or cystine (<1%). A mixture of several types (calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate) may also occur.
Approximately 12-19% of men and 6-9% of women will develop a kidney stone within their lifetime. Fewer African-Americans (~50%) are affected than whites. The peak age in men is around 40 and in women, thirties. It is estimated that about 50% of individuals who had stone formation will have a recurring stone formation within ten years.
Kidney stone risk panels are intended to evaluate the risk of forming stones by testing for high concentrations of common stone-forming substances or low concentrations of stone-inhibiting substances. The specific tests included in a panel may vary somewhat from laboratory to laboratory but will typically include the following: Urine pH
Urine calcium
Urine oxalate (oxalic acid)
Urine uric acid
Urine creatinine (does not cause stones but is used to tell if all urine was collected and help identify how concentrated the urine is)
Urine citrate (citric acid; this substance helps inhibit the formation of stones)
Urine cystine
Urine phosphorus
Urine magnesium (helps inhibit stone formation)
Urine sodium (does not directly cause stones but affects the amount of calcium in urine and thus its ability to form stones)
A high concentration of one or more of these substances in the urine can occur when a person produces and excretes an excess amount of the substance. Other contributing factors include chronically drinking an inadequate amount of fluids, becoming dehydrated to some degree, and having unusually concentrated urine with a strong odor.

They can cause problems either because they grow large enough to obstruct urine flow or because they become dislodged or break off and begin to travel from a kidney through the ureter, where they can cause temporary obstruction and stretch, irritate, and/or damage the walls of the ureter.

Elevated levels of LDL-C are associated with an increased risk of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease.
Usually, your LDL-C level is calculated using the measured values of the components of a standard lipid panel: total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Using a mathematical equation, the amount of LDL-C can be determined from the three measured values. Calculated LDL-C is about as accurate as direct LDL-C when triglyceride levels are normal and can be done at no additional cost as part of a lipid profile.
In most cases, calculated LDL-C is a good estimate of the LDL-C, but it becomes less accurate with increasing triglyceride levels. When triglycerides are significantly elevated (above 400 mg/dL), the equation is no longer valid. Other conditions such as severe cirrhosis can also affect the accuracy of calculated LDL-C. In these situations, the only way to accurately determine LDL-C is to measure it directly or with special testing techniques (e.g., a beta quantification test).
High triglycerides may be due to a metabolic disorder affecting lipids. However, anyone may have high triglycerides after eating. In either situation, the direct LDL-C test can determine the amount of LDL in your blood.
A direct LDL-C may be ordered by your healthcare practitioner when prior test results have indicated high triglycerides. In some laboratories, the direct LDL test will automatically be performed when the triglyceride levels are too high to calculate LDL-C. This saves the healthcare practitioner time by not needing to order another test, saves you time by not needing to have a second blood sample drawn, and speeds up the time to provide the test result.
Whether calculated or measured directly, LDL-C values are used to assess your risk for heart disease and help guide decisions about what treatment may be best if you are at borderline, intermediate, or high risk. The results are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow up. Treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or lipid-lowering medications such as statins. LDL-C tests can also be used to monitor your response to therapy to lower cholesterol.

This test measures the level of LD in the blood or sometimes other body fluids.
Blood LD
Only a small amount of LD is usually detectable in the fluid portion of the blood (serum or plasma). LD is released from the cells into the serum when cells are damaged or destroyed. Thus, an LD blood level is a non-specific marker for the presence of tissue damage somewhere in the body. By itself, it cannot be used to identify the underlying cause or location of the cellular damage. However, it may be used, in conjunction with other blood tests, to help evaluate for and/or monitor conditions that lead to tissue damage, such as liver or blood diseases or cancer.
Fluid LD
Sometimes when there is injury, inflammation, or infection within a specific area of the body, such as the brain, heart or lungs, fluid will accumulate or constituents of the fluid present will change. The level of LD present in the fluid may be useful in determining the cause. For example, LD is typically high in cerebrospinal fluid when an individual has bacterial meningitis. The LD test can also be used, along with other tests, to determine whether fluid accumulation, for example around the heart or lungs or in the abdominal cavity, is due to injury or inflammation (exudate) or due to an imbalance of fluid pressure inside blood vessels and the protein level in blood (transudate).

Only about 20 to 25 species of fungi are common causes of infection. Fungal tests detect infections and sometimes identify the fungus and help guide treatment.
Fungal infections range from superficial skin infections to serious deep tissue, blood, lung, or systemic diseases. Superficial fungal infections are very common. They may cause nail infections or itchy, red, scaly skin infections such as those commonly known as athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm, or yeast infections that cause white patches in the mouth (thrush) or vaginal itching and discharge. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime.
Lung, blood, and systemic infections: less commonly, fungi cause serious lung infections, blood infections (septicemia), or systemic infections that can affect any organ in the body. Fungal lung infections typically start with the accidental inhalation of microscopic fungal spores. While anyone can get a serious lung or systemic fungal infection, most affected people will only experience mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. However, people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, and people with an underlying condition such as diabetes or lung disease are at an increased risk of having a severe fungal infection, a systemic infection, and/or recurrent infections. Fungal tests are used to detect and identify fungi in order to diagnose infections and help guide treatment. Fungal testing typically includes a microscopic examination of the sample on a slide, sometimes using a preparation or stain to aid in detection of fungal elements. This may be sufficient to determine that the infection is due to a fungus and, with superficial infections, no further testing may be required.
However, in cases of persistent, deep, or systemic infections when a more definitive diagnosis is needed, the microscopic exam may be followed by additional tests, such as culture and susceptibility testing, antigen or antibody tests, or molecular tests that detect fungal genetic material."

It is recognized by specific cell surface receptors that allow it to deliver lipids to cells for use or storage and to deliver excess lipids to the liver for excretion.
The ApoE protein has three genetic forms that have slightly different compositions. They are called ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE 4. ApoE3 is the most common form. Compared to ApoeE3, ApoE2 is poorly recognized by cell surface receptors whereas ApoE4 binds more tightly to those receptors. People with ApoE2 tend to have higher amounts of lipids in their blood since delivery from blood to cells is impaired by poor binding of ApoE2 to receptors.
Three different genes (termed alleles) are designated as e2, e3, and e4 and code respectively for ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Each person inherits one allele from each parent. A person who has the same allele from each parent is termed homozygous: e2/e2 or e3/e3 or e4/e4. One who has different alleles is termed heterozygous: e2/e3 or e2/e4 or e3/e4.
The APOE genotype test evaluates a person's DNA to determine what APOE forms (alleles) are present. APOE e3/e3 is the most common genotype (seen in well over half of the population) and is considered ""neutral."" Risks of disease are made relative to the e3/e3 population. APOE e4 (as e4/e4 and e4/e3) is found in nearly a quarter of the population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. People with these genotypes could be predisposed to a significantly elevated level of LDL-C (""bad cholesterol"") and triglycerides when their diet is high in saturated fat. The various APOE allele frequencies differ between ethnic populations.
People with the APOE e2 allele tend to have lower LDL-C levels but elevated triglycerides. APOE e2 is also associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia/hyperlipidemia (HPL III or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), a rare inherited disorder that causes fatty yellowish deposits on the skin called xanthomas, increased triglycerides in the blood, and atherosclerosis that develops at an early age. Importantly, while a large majority of patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia are homozygous for the e2 allele (e2/e2), less than 10% of people with the e2/e2 genotype develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia/hyperlipidemia."

The pancreas is a narrow, flat organ about six inches long located deep within the abdominal cavity, below the liver and between the stomach and the spine. Its head section connects to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Inside the pancreas, small ducts (tubes) feed digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas into the pancreatic duct. Lipase is transported through the pancreatic duct and into the first part of the small intestine, where it helps break down dietary triglycerides (a form of fat) into fatty acids.
Lipase is usually present in the blood in small quantities. When cells in the pancreas are injured, increased amounts of lipase enter the blood and result in higher concentrations in the blood. This can occur in conditions such as pancreatitis, or when the pancreatic duct is blocked by a gallstone or, in rare cases, by a pancreatic tumor."

Chronic pancreatitis, which may present as a series of acute attacks, can cause permanent damage. As the pancreas becomes scarred, some people develop diabetes and/or the inability to digest foods, especially fats, leading to malnutrition. The lack of normal pancreatic enzymes may lead to adverse effects on food digestion and waste production, causing malabsorption, abdominal pain, greasy stools, and the formation of stones in the pancreas. Complications also include pancreatic cancer as well as osteoporosis. Even if the disease is controlled, the damage is often irreversible. If the disease progresses, it could lead to death."

Moderately increased lipase values can occur in other conditions, such as kidney disease, and may also be due to decreased clearance from the blood, salivary gland inflammation, gallbladder inflammation, celiac disease, a bowel obstruction, or peptic ulcer disease. The lipase test is not, however, usually used to monitor these conditions.

Some, but not all, tumor cells have large amounts of PD-L1 that help the tumor cells evade the body's natural defense system—the immune system. A lab test measures how much PD-L1 is present on tumor cells, which can help guide treatment of certain cancers.
One of the ways our immune system fights diseases like cancer is with T cells (T lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell. Some types of T-cells recognize and directly attack cancer cells as well as some other abnormal or infected cells. However, the body has ""immune checkpoints,"" which prevent T-cells from attacking normal cells. PD-L1 and another protein called PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) are part of an immune checkpoint. PD-L1 on the body’s normal cells recognizes and attaches to PD-1 on T cells, turning off (inactivating) the T cell so it can't attack cells.
However, some tumor cells have large amounts of PD-L1. This is a problem because it helps protect the cancer from being attacked by T cells. The cancer cells are more likely to inactivate T cells, escape immune system action, and survive.
New cancer drugs (immunotherapies) have been developed to disrupt the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. These immunotherapies are antibodies that attach to PD-L1 or PD-1 and block their interaction so that T cells are not inactivated by cancer cells. This boosts the body's natural immune system and its ability to recognize and fight the cancer.
Blocking this immune checkpoint pathway with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies has stopped or slowed the growth of cancers such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma. These immunotherapies are also being studied for treatment of many other types of cancer."

Strep tests include rapid strep tests and throat cultures that detect these bacteria in a sample taken from the back of your throat.
While most sore throats are caused by a virus and will resolve without treatment within a few days, some people with sore throats have strep throat. Strep throat is most common in children and teens ages 5 to 15 years old. It is important to diagnose and treat strep infections promptly with antibiotics because they are very contagious and complications can develop. Strep throat can easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and other people come into contact with the droplets or mucus. Touching your face, eyes or mouth after touching something that has these droplets on it can spread the infection. The best way to avoid getting strep throat is to wash your hands thoroughly and often and avoid sharing items like utensils or cups. If you have a sore throat, you should wash your hands often and cover your mouth with a tissue or sleeve when coughing and sneezing.
If strep throat is not diagnosed and treated, complications may develop, especially in children. These complications may include rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart, and glomerulonephritis, which affects the kidneys.

The Infection is highly contagious but is preventable with a vaccine. A rubella test detects and measures rubella antibodies in the blood that are produced by the body's immune system in response to immunization or an infection by the rubella virus.
Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable; therefore, cases must be laboratory-confirmed. Antibody tests are the most common methods of confirming the diagnosis of rubella.
The rubella virus generally causes a mild infection marked by a fine red rash that appears on the face and neck and then travels to the trunk and limbs before disappearing a few days later. The virus is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. The infection can cause symptoms such as fever, enlarged lymph nodes, runny nose, red eyes, and joint pain. Symptoms may be so minimal, especially in children, that they go unnoticed and people do not know that they have a viral illness. In most people, rubella goes away within a couple of days without any special medical treatment and usually causes no further health issues.
The primary concern with rubella infection is when a pregnant woman contracts it for the first time during the first three months of her pregnancy. The developing baby (fetus) is most vulnerable to the virus at this time. If rubella is passed from a mother to her unborn baby, it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), a group of serious birth defects that will permanently affect the child. CRS can cause intellectual and development disabilities, deafness, cloudiness of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), an abnormally small head, liver problems, and heart defects.
Because of the severe consequences for unborn babies, a national campaign was started in 1969 to immunize all children in the United States and to work to eradicate rubella infection, first in the U.S. and then throughout the world. The rubella vaccine is contained in a combination vaccine called MMR, which stands for measles, mumps and rubella. All children should receive two doses of MMR, the first dose at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age.
Prior to 1969 and routine vaccinations, rubella infections would emerge as cyclic outbreaks that lasted for several years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the 1962-1965 rubella epidemic, 12.5 million cases of rubella occurred in the U.S. and there were 20,000 infants born with CRS. Due to vaccination efforts, these numbers have decreased drastically. The number of reported cases of rubella in the United States has declined dramatically to a median of 11 cases annually in 2005-2011.
The CDC now declares endemic rubella to be eradicated in the U.S., although people traveling from other countries bring it to the U.S. and the incidence continues to be monitored. People should not become complacent with this reduction, however, and the CDC cautions people to continue to have their children vaccinated. Anyone who has not received the vaccination as a child (and a few that have) may still be vulnerable to rubella infection.
Pregnant women and women considering pregnancy continue to be routinely tested for rubella antibodies to ensure that they are immune."

The term HLA-B27 is also used to refer to the gene that codes for the HLA-B27 protein. The HLA-B27 test determines the presence or absence of HLA-B27 protein on the surface of a person's white blood cells.
Human leukocyte antigens are proteins that help the body's immune system identify its own cells and distinguish between ""self"" and ""nonself."" Everyone has an inherited combination of HLA genes that code for the many antigens present on the surfaces of their cells. The presence or absence of each antigen creates a distinctive HLA combination for each person.
HLA-B27 is found in about 6% of the U.S. population. People with HLA-B27 have an increased likelihood of developing autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), reactive arthritis (of which one subset is Reiter syndrome), and isolated acute anterior uveitis. HLA-B27 has also been linked with inflammatory bowel disease and a range of other chronic conditions.
Ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis are both chronic, progressive conditions that occur more frequently in men than women. The first symptoms typically occur when a person is in their early 30's. Often, the initial symptoms of these autoimmune disorders are subtle and may take several years before characteristic degenerative changes to bones and joints are visible on X-rays. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by pain, inflammation, and a gradual stiffening of the spine, neck and chest.
Reactive arthritis is a group of symptoms that includes inflammation of the joints, urethra, and eyes as well as skin lesions.
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a form of arthritis that occurs in children.
Anterior uveitis is associated with recurring inflammation of the structures of one or both eyes. While HLA-B27 has not been established as a cause of any of these disorders, there is a higher prevalence of the antigen in those affected. For example, even though only 6% of the population has HLA-B27, 80-90% of people with ankylosing spondylitis are positive for HLA-B27."

The result adds information and is one piece of evidence used along with the evaluation of signs, symptoms, and other laboratory tests to support or rule out the diagnosis of certain autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis."

However, almost all people with celiac disease are positive for DQ2 or DQ8, so a negative result can essentially rule out celiac disease in those individuals for whom results of other tests, including biopsy, are unclear.

Marijuana contains many chemical compounds that interact with the body, called cannabinoids. The main mind-altering cannabinoid in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The body breaks down THC into several inactive metabolites (e.g., THC-COOH, 11-nor-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Since the metabolites of THC stay in the body for a longer period of time than THC does, most marijuana testing detects the presence of THC-COOH or other metabolites in urine. Some tests also detect the active compound, THC, for example when marijuana testing is done using blood or saliva.
Marijuana leaves can be smoked, prepared and eaten in food products, or ingested as a tincture. Smoking or ingesting marijuana causes a faster heartbeat and pulse rate, bloodshot eyes, and dry mouth and throat. It may cause short- and long-term effects, including impaired short-term memory, altered sense of time, decreased ability to concentrate, altered reaction time, decreased coordination, increased risk of psychosis, and cyclic episodes of nausea, stomach pain and vomiting. Marijuana use impairs driving ability, and accident risk greatly increases if the driver is also drinking alcohol. Marijuana today has higher THC concentrations than in the past, which can lead to greater levels of impairment.
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance as defined by U.S. federal law. However, marijuana is used both recreationally and medicinally, and its use has been legalized in a number of states and Canada.
Marijuana as medicine
Some people use marijuana to treat a variety of conditions. Due to legal restrictions on marijuana, its therapeutic effects and safety have been difficult to research.
Natural cannabis may be obtained in some states with a medical marijuana card, an identification card issued by the state with a healthcare practitioner's recommendation. It allows a patient to obtain, possess, and/or grow marijuana for medicinal use. The process for obtaining these cards varies by state.
Synthetic forms or purified forms of THC and other cannabinoids are available as prescription medications that can be taken by mouth, inhaled, or sprayed under the tongue. Dronabinol and nabilone are two drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that contain THC. They are sometimes prescribed to treat chemotherapy-associated nausea that does not respond to standard treatments.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound related to THC that is a product of the marijuana plant. It is available in liquid form (CBD oil) as an FDA-approved medication that may be used to treat pain and inflammation and some epileptic seizures. Some ""herbal supplements"" also contain CBD but are not regulated by the FDA. Unlike THC, CBD is not intoxicating—it does not make people ""high."" However, because CBD is derived from the marijuana plant, it may contain variable amounts of THC.
Nabiximols is a marijuana-derived prescription drug that contains THC and CBD. It may be used to treat muscle control problems in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Though this drug has not been approved by the FDA, it has been approved for use in Canada, the United Kingdom, and some European countries. Anything that contains THC has the potential to be detected as THC or THC-COOH in a marijuana test. In medical cases, drug testing results are typically reported to the physicians who ordered the tests and they interpret the meaning of results in the context of the medical cases. To aid the interpretation of results, patients should notify their physicians of any over-the-counter or prescription medications (including marijuana) or supplements they are taking.
Marijuana laws and policies
Drug testing policy for THC can become confusing due to conflicting state and federal laws and policies. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug according to U.S. federal law. The government considers Schedule 1 drugs to have high potential for abuse, lack evidence of safety and effectiveness, with no currently accepted medical use in the U.S.
Since 1986, U.S. federal employees and employees in federally-regulated jobs that affect public safety like transportation and air traffic control have been prohibited from using illegal drugs. In U.S. federally regulated tests, no marijuana use is considered legitimate, except in the case of prescription synthetic THC, such as dronabinol. Private employers not under federal drug testing regulations are free to determine their own drug testing policies and may or may not test for marijuana use.
If someone is given a drug test for legal or employment purposes while taking a prescription form of THC, they should report their prescription to the physician who will review the test results (Medical Review Officer or MRO) and/or list it under 'prescriptions' in the appropriate space on the specimen collection form. Positive drug testing results that are due to prescription medications may be reported by the MRO as ""negative.""
Marijuana testing
To test for marijuana, healthcare practitioners may send urine samples to a laboratory for screening or they may perform a test in their office. Testing may be performed with point-of-care tests, which are typically small strips that are dipped into the urine and interpreted by the appearance or absence of a colored line on the strip.
Positive screening tests for marijuana are presumptive. This is because all drug screening tests have the potential for false-positive results. Therefore, screening tests that are positive are often confirmed with a second test, which is referred to as a confirmatory test. Confirmatory tests are usually more sensitive and specific than screening tests. Confirmatory testing is usually performed with an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Types of mass spectrometry tests used for confirmatory testing include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Additional testing may also be performed to identify whether any substance has been added to the urine sample, such as water, bleach, or other types of chemicals (adulterants) in an attempt to interfere with the test result. If adulteration is suspected, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.
Urine samples may also be identified as dilute. Dilute urine may be produced if an individual drinks large amounts of water or other liquids prior to testing. Dilute urine may also result from some medical conditions. If an individual adds liquid such as water to a urine sample, this may also cause dilute urine. It may not always be possible to determine how the urine was diluted. If the urine is so dilute that the results are not reliable, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated."

Illicit synthetic cannabinoids can have unpredictable and potentially life-threatening effects on the body, including seizures, brain swelling, and heart palpitations. Because these chemicals are not THC, they will not be detected with tests specific for THC or THC-COOH. A test that is specifically designed to detect the synthetic compound in K2 or Spice is needed.

These compounds are by-products of heme synthesis and are normally present at low levels in blood and other body fluids. Porphyrin tests measure porphyrins and their precursors in urine, blood, and/or stool.
Heme is an iron-containing pigment that is a component of hemoglobin and a number of other proteins. It consists of an organic portion (protoporphyrin) bound to an iron atom. The synthesis of heme is a step-by-step process that requires the sequential action of eight different enzymes. If there is a deficiency in one of these enzymes, the process is impeded and intermediate porphyrins such as uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin build up in the body's fluids and tissues. The precursors that accumulate depend on which enzyme is deficient, and they can exert toxic effects.
Porphyrin tests are used to help diagnose and monitor a group of disorders called porphyrias. There are seven types of porphyria, and each one is associated with a different enzyme deficiency. Most porphyrias are inherited, the result of a gene change (variant). Porphyrias may be classified according to the signs and symptoms of the disease as neurological, cutaneous, or both.
The porphyrias that cause neurological symptoms present with acute attacks lasting days or weeks. Signs and symptoms during the attack include abdominal pain, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, and/or seizures. There are four neurologic porphyrias: acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and the very rare ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP). Some cases of VP and HCP may also have skin-related symptoms.
The cutaneous porphyrias are associated with photosensitivity that causes redness, swelling, a burning sensation, blistering, skin thickening, hyperpigmentation, and/or scarring. There are three cutaneous porphyrias: porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). For more information about each disease, see the article on Porphyria.
Experts have not yet reached agreement on whether all porphyrias are inherited. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) may result from genetic or environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals or significant liver damage. This type of PCT is termed ""acquired"" or ""sporadic."" In patients with acquired PCT, the disorder usually develops after age 30 and onset in childhood is rare.
To diagnose porphyrias, laboratories measure porphyrins and their precursors in urine, blood, and/or stool. Testing may include measurement of one or more of the following: Porphobilinogen (PBG), a porphyrin precursor, in urine
Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), another porphyrin precursor, in urine
Porphyrins (uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin) in urine, blood, or stool Specialized laboratories may offer testing for one or more of the affected enzymes. The most commonly measured enzyme is porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) in red blood cells, which tests for acute intermittent porphyria. A few laboratories offer genetic testing for specific gene variants that cause one of the porphyrias, but this type of testing is not widely available. If your healthcare practitioner strongly suspects a specific type of porphyria, a sample for genetic testing may be sent to a reference laboratory that performs that type of testing routinely."

The HLA genes that individuals inherit are responsible for the HLA antigens present on their cells. HLA testing identifies the major HLA antigens that are present on the surface of an individual's cells and the antibodies to HLA antigens as well as the genes that are responsible for HLA antigens, primarily to match transplant donors and recipients.
In humans, the HLA genes are located in region of chromosome 6 called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC plays an essential role in the management of the immune system. It helps the body's immune system distinguish which cells are ""self"" and which are ""foreign"" or ""non-self."" Any cells that are recognized as ""non-self"" can trigger an immune response, including the production of antibodies. HLA antibody testing is performed on transplant recipients to determine if they have antibodies that would target the HLA antigens on the donated organ or tissue. HLA antibody testing is also performed on platelet transfusion recipients to determine if they have any antibodies that would target the donor's platelets and prevent a good response to the transfusion.
For hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant, the HLA genes of the donor and recipient must be the same or match as closely as possible for transplantation to be successful and to lessen the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (See Common Questions below).
In solid organ transplants, such as kidney, heart, or lung transplants, ABO blood group compatibility is critical. After matching ABO types, it is also beneficial to match the HLA antigens between the donor and recipient. Unlike ABO matching, HLA typing mismatches are less critical as long as the recipient has not developed HLA antibodies directed against donor's antigens. Various drugs may be administered to help suppress the recipient's immune system in order to minimize organ rejection.
Finding a donor who is compatible with an intended recipient may sometimes be difficult. Part of the reason is because each HLA gene can have numerous possible forms or variations (alleles). This characteristic is referred to as polymorphic. In addition, there are more than 200 genes that make up the large HLA gene family located on chromosome 6. Considering the many different possible combinations and numerous types of HLA alleles, it can be a challenge to find a suitable donor, especially if the recipient has pre-formed HLA antibodies.
Nevertheless, HLA genes are located close together and inherited together as groups known as haplotypes; thus, a child inherits one haplotype from each parent. Because of this, there is a greater chance that family members will have the same group of HLA alleles compared to non-related potential donors. Often, a recipient's parents, children, or siblings may serve as the best transplant matches.

It is normally elevated in women during pregnancy and just after childbirth. It is normally low in men and non-pregnant women. This test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.
Prolactin is produced by the front portion (anterior) of the pituitary gland, a grape-sized organ found at the base of the brain. The brain chemical dopamine and hormone estrogen control prolactin production and release from the pituitary gland. During pregnancy, the hormones prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone stimulate breast development and milk production. Following childbirth, prolactin helps initiate and maintain the breast milk supply. If a woman does not breastfeed, her prolactin level soon drops back to pre-pregnancy levels. If she does nurse, suckling by the infant plays an important role in the release of prolactin. There is a feedback mechanism between how often the baby nurses and the amount of prolactin released by the pituitary as well as the amount of milk produced.
A common cause of an abnormally elevated prolactin level is a prolactinoma, a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes excess production of prolactin. Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary tumor and is usually benign. They develop more frequently in women but are also found in men. Symptoms can arise both from the unintended effects of excess prolactin, such as milk production in a woman who is not pregnant or nursing and, rarely, in a man (galactorrhea), as well as from the size and location of the tumor.
If the anterior pituitary gland and/or the tumor enlarge significantly, it can put pressure on the optic nerve, causing headaches and problems with vision. It can also interfere with the other hormones that the pituitary gland produces. In women, prolactinomas can cause infertility and irregularities in menstruation, while in men these tumors can cause a gradual loss in sexual function and libido. Left untreated, prolactinomas may eventually damage the surrounding tissues."

Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria or parts of it (antigens) to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia.
A legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms (without pneumonia). Together, Legionnaires disease and Pontiac fever are referred to as legionellosis.
Legionella bacteria are found naturally throughout the environment. They prefer warm, stagnant water and can grow in the plumbing systems of large buildings such as hotels, hospitals, and cruise ships. The bacteria may contaminate whirlpool spas, drinking and bathing water, hot water tanks, air conditioning cooling towers, ice machines, humidifiers, and public fountains.
Infections occur when an individual inhales airborne water droplets such as steam or mist that are contaminated with Legionella bacteria. The bacteria are not passed from one person to another, but many people can become infected by the same contaminated water source, potentially resulting in a legionellosis outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), legionellosis outbreaks occur any time two or more people become ill in the same place at about the same time.
Legionella infection or Pontiac fever is confirmed when a person showing typical symptoms of the disease has a positive confirmatory laboratory test (usually a positive culture or urine test).
State and local health departments have jurisdiction over legionellosis outbreaks in their state; however, legionellosis is a nationally notifiable disease and state health departments should report all laboratory-confirmed cases to the CDC.
Pontiac fever typically develops within 24-48 hours while Legionnaires disease develops within a few days to a couple of weeks. According to the CDC, about 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires disease each year. The actual number of people affected by legionellosis is likely much higher as most cases of Pontiac fever and many cases of Legionnaires disease are thought to go undiagnosed.
Although anyone may be affected, adults over 50 are at the highest risk for Legionnaires disease, as are those who smoke, have lung diseases, or have compromised immune systems (such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or who are taking immunosuppressant medications). People with chronic underlying diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease are also more vulnerable, and men are affected more often than women. Most cases of Legionnaires disease are sporadic, but they may also be seen in outbreaks, which typically occur during the summer and early fall. Pontiac fever is frequently linked with outbreaks.
There are many different types of Legionella bacteria, but only a few are common. In the United States, as many as 80% of legionella infections in adults are caused by Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1 (a subtype of the species). Other serogroups of L. pneumophila, including 4 and 6, cause a number of cases. Other species of Legionella, such as Legionella micdadei, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, and Legionella longbeachae, may cause infections in children and/or are more prevalent in other parts of the world."

The test detects antibodies, the body's immune response to a legionella infection, in the blood. It is not useful for immediate clinical decision-making but can be ordered to confirm a recent infection. Usually two blood samples taken weeks apart are tested, and an increase in the level of antibodies against the bacteria indicates an active infection. A single positive antibody test cannot be used to diagnose a recent infection as up to 15% of the general population may have legionella antibodies in their blood, indicating exposure to the bacteria at some point in their life. Some people, such as those who have compromised immune systems, can have a legionella infection without having a normal antibody response."

This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood.
Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts inside the liver. It is a slow-progressing disease that causes worsening liver destruction and blockage of the bile flow. Blocked bile ducts can lead to a build-up of harmful substances within the liver and may eventually lead to permanent scarring (cirrhosis). PBC is found most frequently in women between the ages of 35 and 60. About 90-95% of those affected by PBC will have significant titers of antimitochondrial antibodies.
AMA are autoantibodies that develop against antigens within the body. There are nine types of AMA antigens (M1 – M9) of which M2 and M9 are the most likely to cause illness (clinically significant). The presence of the M2 type of AMA has been particularly evident in PBC, while the other types may be found in other conditions. Some laboratories offer the AMA-M2 as a more specific test for PBC.

Antithrombin testing measures the activity (function) and the amount (quantity) of antithrombin in an individual's blood and is used to evaluate the person for excessive blood clotting.
Normally, when a blood vessel is injured, the body initiates a complex process called hemostasis to form a blood clot and prevent further blood loss. Part of this complex process involves the activation of several proteins called coagulation factors in a series of steps referred to as the coagulation cascade. Antithrombin helps to regulate this process by inhibiting the action of several activated coagulation factors, including thrombin and factors Xa, IXa, and XIa, to slow down the process and prevent excessive or inappropriate clotting (thrombosis).
People with an excessive clotting disorder due to an inherited or acquired antithrombin deficiency are at increased risk of developing blood clots, especially in deep veins such as in the legs (known as deep venous thrombosis or DVT). Inherited deficiencies are rare, affecting about 1 in 5,000 people. For people who inherit one defective gene and one normal gene (heterozygous), episodes of inappropriate blood clot formation typically start at about 20 to 30 years of age. Very rarely, a person may inherit two defective antithrombin genes, resulting in severe clotting problems soon after birth.
Acquired antithrombin deficiencies may occur at any age. They are associated with a variety of conditions that cause decreased production, excessive consumption, or loss of antithrombin. These conditions include liver disease, extensive thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), blood loss, cancer, and nephrotic syndrome – a form of kidney disease.
There are two types of antithrombin deficiency. With type 1, antithrombin functions normally, but the quantity is insufficient. With type 2, there is a sufficient quantity of antithrombin produced, but it is dysfunctional. These types can be differentiated and assessed by testing: Antithrombin activity, which evaluates the function of antithrombin
Antithrombin antigen, which measures the quantity of antithrombin present"

B vitamin tests measure these specific compounds in the blood or urine to help evaluate a person's nutritional status.
B vitamins are absorbed from the diet, used as needed, and any excess is removed from the body through the urine. Because B vitamins are water-soluble, only small amounts are stored by the body and they must be obtained from foods rich in B vitamins or from supplements on a regular basis. Severe B vitamin deficiencies are rare in the United States but are still prevalent in areas of the world with diet deficiencies.
B vitamin deficiencies can occur when: There is an inadequate supply of B vitamins.
You are unable to absorb or utilize one or more of the vitamins.
You eat foods or take drugs that slow or prevent the absorption, production or action of a vitamin.
A deficiency in another vitamin or mineral prevents its use.
The need for the vitamin is increased. In the U.S., B vitamin deficiencies are primarily seen in people with general malnutrition, chronic alcoholism, malabsorption or digestive disorders (e.g., celiac disease), those who have had gastric bypass surgery, and in the elderly. They are also sometimes seen with other chronic diseases, with cancer and cancer treatment, with use of medicines that interfere with the breakdown and use of vitamins, with special diets, and with diarrhea that lasts more than a few days to weeks.
Pregnant women with a limited diet can be at an increased risk for B vitamin deficiencies and so can their babies. Rarely, a baby may have an inborn error of metabolism – a condition that prevents the proper use of a B vitamin.
Symptoms associated with B vitamin deficiencies can be nonspecific, especially with mild to moderate deficiencies. Individuals often have multiple vitamin deficiencies, so they may also have a wide variety of symptoms. Common deficiency symptoms include a rash, dermatitis, red, swollen tongue, numbness, tingling or burning in the hands or feet, anemia, fatigue, and mental changes.
B vitamin toxicity rarely occurs, usually when someone ingests much more than the recommended dose of supplements. High concentrations of a few of the B vitamins may affect the liver or nervous system.
The B vitamins include:  B1, Thiamine or thiamin 			Also known as: Vitamin F, Aneurin, Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) – physiologically active form
Role: B1 is a coenzyme that helps the body produce energy, is involved in glucose, amino acid, lipid, and alcohol metabolism, and is required for the proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and muscles.
Sources: Whole grains and fortified bread, cereal, pasta, and rice; Meat (especially pork) and fish; Legumes (such as black beans and soybeans), seeds, and nuts
Deficiency: Found primarily with chronic alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, those who have had bariatric surgery and older individuals. Some medicines such as furosemide and 5-fluorouracil can lower thiamin levels in the body. Thiamin deficiency can cause loss of weight and appetite, confusion, memory loss, muscle weakness, and heart problems. It causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which mostly affects people with alcoholism, with tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, severe memory loss, disorientation, and confusion. Less commonly, severe thiamin deficiency leads to a disease called beriberi.
Test name: Thiamine (Thiamine diphosphate) in blood
Other ways to measure: Transketolase (functional thiamine test)    B2, Riboflavin 			Also known as: Vitamin G
Role: B2 is a coenzyme involved in energy production, cellular function, growth, and development; and metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids, and is required for the metabolism of other B vitamins. In addition, riboflavin helps maintain normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood.
Sources: Eggs, organ meats (such as kidneys and liver), lean meats, and low-fat milk; Green vegetables (such as asparagus, broccoli, and spinach); Fortified cereals, bread, and grain products
Deficiency: Called ariboflavinosis, usually seen along with other vitamin deficiencies in those with alcoholism, malabsorption, liver disease, in the elderly, vegetarians (especially strict vegetarians who avoid dairy foods and eggs), pregnant women and breastfeeding women and their babies. Riboflavin deficiency can cause skin disorders, sores at the corners of your mouth, swollen and cracked lips, hair loss, sore throat, liver disorders, and problems with reproductive and nervous systems. Severe, long-term riboflavin deficiency can cause anemia and cataracts.
Test name: Riboflavin, blood or urine
Other ways to measure: Glutathione reductase in erythrocytes (activity)    B3, Niacin 			Also known as: Nicotinic acid, Nicotinamide, Vitamin P, Vitamin PP
Role: B3 is involved in enzyme reactions, metabolism, and energy production. It is given in pharmacologic doses to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise HDL cholesterol
Sources: Meats, such as poultry, beef, pork, and fish; Some types of nuts, legumes, and grains; Enriched and fortified foods, such as many breads and cereals
Deficiency: Seen in undernourished people with AIDS, alcohol use disorder, anorexia, inflammatory bowel disease, or liver cirrhosis; with carcinoid syndrome, a condition in which slow-growing tumors develop in the digestive tract. Severe niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra, classic symptoms are dermatitis (rough skin that turns red or brown in the sun), a bright red tongue, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, depression, headaches, extreme tiredness, aggressive, paranoid, suicidal behavior, hallucinations, apathy, loss of memory
Toxicity: Pharmacologic doses can cause flushing, headaches, low blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, blurred or impaired vision and fluid buildup in the eyes. High doses may damage liver.
Test name: Niacin and metabolites in blood or urine; N1-Methylnicotinamide, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide in urine thought to be the most reliable measure of intake and body status
Other ways to measure: measured as NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in blood or urine    B5, Pantothenic acid 			Role: B5 helps break down and use fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
Sources: Most foods
Deficiency: B5 deficiency is rare as it is widely distributed in foods. However, people with a rare inherited disorder called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration can't use pantothenic acid properly. This disorder can lead to symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency, associated with ""burning feet"" and impaired wound healing.
Test name: Pantothenic acid in blood or urine    B6, Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP) 			Role: B6 is a coenzyme involved in amino acid metabolism and hemoglobin synthesis. It is also necessary for the nervous system and immune system.
Sources: Poultry, fish, and organ meats; Potatoes and other starchy vegetables; Fruit (other than citrus)
Deficiency: B6 deficiency is rare by itself; adequate B2 is required for the formation of active PLP; may be seen with chronic alcoholism, malabsorption, smoking, kidney malfunction, autoimmune disorders and in those who take certain antiepileptic drugs and theophylline. Deficiency can cause anemia, itchy rashes, scaly skin on the lips, cracks at the corners of the mouth, a swollen tongue, depression, confusion, and a weak immune system. Infants who do not get enough vitamin B6 can become irritable or develop extremely sensitive hearing or seizures. Overdosing can cause severe nerve damage, leading people to lose control of their bodily movements.
Test name: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in blood
Other ways to measure: Vitamin B6 functional test, Urine 4-pyridoxic acid, urine xanthurenic acid    B7, Biotin 			Also known as: Vitamin H, Coenzyme R, Biopeiderm
Role: B7 is a coenzyme that is necessary for fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism and plays a role in hormone production.
Sources: Meat, fish, eggs, and organ meats (such as liver); Seeds and nuts; Certain vegetables (such as sweet potatoes, spinach, and broccoli). B7 is also made by intestinal bacteria.
Deficiency: Very rare; may occur in those receiving total parenteral nutrition, with chronic alcohol abuse, and with some inborn errors of metabolism, such as ""biotinidase deficiency""; deficiency of biotin can cause thinning hair and loss of body hair; a rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and anal area; pinkeye; seizures; skin infection; brittle nails; and nervous system disorders. Symptoms of biotin deficiency in infants include weak muscle tone, sluggishness, and delayed development. Biotin has not been shown to cause any harm. However, supplements that contain biotin may cause false results in many lab tests, including but not limited to cardiovascular diagnostic tests and hormone tests.
Test names: Biotin in blood
Other ways to measure: Urinary 3-hydroxyisovalerate excretion    B12, Cobalamin 			See the article on Vitamin B12 and Folate    B9, Folic Acid or Folate 			Also known as: Vitamin B9, Vitamin M

Some types of HPV are considered high risk because they can cause cancer. HPV testing detects the genetic material (DNA or messenger RNA) of high-risk HPV (hrHPV), primarily to screen for cervical cancer or to determine whether you may be at risk of cervical cancer.
Some types of HPV can cause skin warts, while other types can cause genital warts (also called condylomata). Genital HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (i.e., spread through oral, anal, or genital sex). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 79 million Americans are infected with HPV and over 14 million become newly infected each year. Low-risk HPV—some HPV strains cause genital warts but rarely cause cancer. HPV 6 and HPV 11 cause 90% of all genital warts but are considered ""low risk"" because they rarely lead to cancer. These low-risk types can be diagnosed through visual inspection and, therefore, do not require testing.
High-risk HPV—there are 14 high-risk types of HPV that can lead to cancer (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68). Two HPV types,16 and 18, cause 80% of all cervical cancers. These high-risk types can be detected with an HPV test.
Many HPV infections resolve without treatment—the body is able to clear the infection. However, infections with high-risk HPV types that do not go away can lead to cervical cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infections with high-risk HPV. Each year, nearly 12,000 women in the U.S. develop cervical cancer and about 4,000 are expected to die from it.
In addition, some studies have also shown that persistent oral infections with high-risk types of HPV are strongly associated with oral cancers, including cancer of the mouth and throat (oropharyngeal cancer). Anal cancer has also been linked to HPV types 16 and 18. These types are also linked to other cancers, such as those of the vagina and penis."

Some abnormal tissues, tumors, and cancers, however, may also produce hCG, making the hCG test useful as a tumor marker. This test measures the amount of intact hCG, and sometimes the beta subunit of hCG, in the blood.
An increased level of hCG is seen with gestational trophoblastic disease and some germ cell tumors (benign and cancerous). If hCG is increased with these conditions, then the hCG test can be used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool.
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of tumor types that develop in a woman's uterus from the layer of cells surrounding an embryo that creates the placenta during a normal pregnancy (trophoblasts) and produces hCG. GTD usually occurs at the beginning of pregnancy after an egg has been fertilized, but instead of supporting the growth of a fetus, the cells form abnormal tissue masses. In most cases, the tumors are benign, but in a small percentage of people, they are cancerous. According to the American Cancer Society, GTD occurs in about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. It can also occur after a normal pregnancy or after a miscarriage or abortion. The primary forms of GTD are: Hydatidiform mole – also called a ""molar pregnancy,"" which may be complete (only tumor tissue) or a mixture of tumor and fetal tissue but does not develop into a viable baby; these are usually benign but must be surgically removed.
Invasive mole – a hydatidiform mole that grows into the uterus wall; it must be surgically removed; however, the condition can persist if GTD tissue remains.
Choriocarcinoma – a rare cancer that may develop from the GTD tumor tissue in about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies; these cancers can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body.
Placental site trophoblastic tumor – also rare, this tumor arises at the site of placental attachment in the uterus. This tumor usually develops after a normal or aborted pregnancy but doesn't often spread through the body.
Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor – extremely rare, this tumor is similar in nature to the choriocarcinoma but is now considered a separate disease. It may take many years after a pregnancy for this tumor to be detected and may have already spread to other parts of the body. Note: With appropriate treatment, the cure rate for most GTD is very high. For more on this, see the links in the Related Content section below.
Germ cell tumors and cancers occur primarily in the ovaries and testicles but can also rarely develop in other locations such as the chest. Germ cell tumors can occur in the egg-producing cells of the ovaries and are more often seen in younger women (for more, see Ovarian Cancer).
Germ cell tumors can affect cells within the testicles that make sperm and account for more than 90% of testicular cancers (for more, see Testicular Cancer). Levels of hCG may also be elevated in other diseases such as liver, breast, lung, skin, and stomach cancers. Increased levels may also be seen in non-cancer conditions such as cirrhosis, duodenal ulcer, and inflammatory bowel disease."

This test detects and measures beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies in the blood.
Beta-2 glycoprotein antibody is considered one of the primary autoantibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies that mistakenly target the body's own lipid-proteins (phospholipids) found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. This test is often ordered along with tests for other antiphospholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant.
Antiphospholipid antibodies interfere with the body's blood clotting process in a way that is not fully understood yet. They increase the risk of developing inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in both arteries and veins.
Antiphospholipid antibodies most frequently develop in people with the autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This condition is associated with widespread blood clots (thrombotic episodes), a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), or with pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriages, especially in the second and third trimesters.
Also, some people with autoimmune disorders such as lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) may begin to produce one or more of these autoantibodies, which can put them at risk of forming blood clots in blood vessels."

The results can be used to determine the risk that the baby has a chromosome disorder or neural tube defect such as spina bifida.
These substances include the following, listed below. When the first three substances are measured together, it is called a triple screen. When the fourth substance, inhibin A, is added, it is called a quad screen. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by fetal tissue. During development, AFP levels in fetal blood and amniotic fluid rise until about 12 weeks, and then levels gradually fall until birth. Some AFP crosses the placenta into the mother's blood. With certain problems affecting a baby, an increased amount of AFP leaks into amniotic fluid and then into the mother's blood. As such, an AFP test is used to screen for neural tube defects such as spina bifida. It may be performed as part of the triple or quad screen. It may be performed by itself when risk for chromosome disorders (Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)) have already been assessed using first trimester Down syndrome screening or cell-free fetal DNA testing. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the AFP test detects neural tube defects in 85% of the cases.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta. Levels in maternal blood rise for the first trimester of pregnancy and then decrease during the remainder of the pregnancy. In pregnancies where the fetus is carrying the chromosomal defect that results in Down syndrome, hCG tends to be high whereas in pregnancies where the fetus has the chromosomal defect that results in Edwards syndrome, hCG tends to be low.
Unconjugated estriol (uE3) is a form of estrogen that is produced by the fetus through metabolism. This process involves the liver, adrenals, and the placenta. Some of the unconjugated estriol crosses the placenta and can be measured in the mother's blood. Levels rise around the 8th week and continue to increase until shortly before delivery. In pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome, uE3 tends to be low.
Inhibin A is a hormone produced by the placenta. Inhibin is a dimer (has two parts) and is sometimes referred to as DIA or dimeric inhibin A. Levels in maternal blood decrease slightly from 14 to 17 weeks gestation and then rise again. Levels tend to be higher in pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome. Including the fourth marker, inhibin A, increases both the sensitivity and specificity of the screen for Down syndrome. According to ACOG, the triple screen detects Down syndrome in 69% of the cases while the quad screen detects it in 81% of the cases.
If the results of maternal serum screening are cause for concern, diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may be recommended."

Many of the complications of Down syndrome can be treated and the lifespan of those affected has greatly increased in recent years. The risk of having a child with Down syndrome increases with the age of the mother. Although the risk of having an affected baby is significantly greater in those older than 35, the majority of Down syndrome babies (about 80%) are born to those under 35 because this age group has the greatest number of children. For this reason, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that all pregnant women be offered a screening test for Down syndrome."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/amylase,Amylase,['Amy'],[],"July 17, 2018.","March 24, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Amylase is an enzyme produced primarily by the pancreas and the salivary glands to help digest carbohydrates. This test measures the amount of amylase in the blood or urine or sometimes in peritoneal fluid, which is fluid found between the membranes that cover the abdominal cavity and the outside of abdominal organs.
The pancreas is a narrow, flat organ about six inches long located deep within the abdominal cavity, below the liver and between the stomach and the spine. Its head section connects to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Inside the pancreas, small ducts (tubes) feed digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas into the pancreatic duct. The pancreas releases amylase through the pancreatic duct into the first part of the small intestine, where it helps break down dietary carbohydrates.
Amylase is usually present in the blood and urine in small quantities. When cells in the pancreas are injured, increased amounts of amylase are released into the blood. This also increases concentrations of amylase in the urine because amylase is eliminated from the blood through the urine. Increased amylase levels can occur with pancreatitis or when the pancreatic duct is blocked by a gallstone or, in rare cases, with a pancreatic tumor."

Tests can detect these autoantibodies that bind to phospholipids and, in a way that is not well understood, increase the risk of excessive blood clotting.
Several tests are available, including: Cardiolipin antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies)
Lupus anticoagulant assays, these include activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), dRVVT (dilute Russell viper venom time), kaolin (or silica) clotting time, and PTT mixing tests
Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies Phospholipids are structural components of cell membranes and play a crucial role in blood clotting. Phospholipds are critical to platelet function in addition to various coagulation co-factors. When antiphospholipid antibodies are produced, they interfere with the clotting process. They increase an affected person's risk of developing recurrent inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in arteries and veins, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and/or miscarriages.
Antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated with low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and with the risk of recurrent miscarriages (especially in the second and third trimester), premature labor, and pre-eclampsia.
One or more antiphospholipid antibodies have been identified in various conditions. Some examples are:
Autoimmune disorders Lupus
Rheumatoid arthritis
Systemic sclerosis Infections HIV
Mononucleosis
Rubella Cancers Solid tumors (colon, lung, etc.)
Leukemias
Lymphomas Use of certain drugs Procainamide
Phenothiazines
Oral contraceptives The presence of phospholipid antibodies in some instances may be temporary and they have been identified in some individuals who have no detectable illnesses.
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also called Hughes syndrome, is a recognized group of signs and symptoms that includes the formation of blood clots, miscarriages, platelet deficiency (thrombocytopenia), and the presence of one or more antiphospholipid antibodies. APS can be primary with no underlying autoimmune disorder or secondary, existing with a diagnosed autoimmune disorder.
The 14th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force criteria for identifying APS requires testing for cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies when one of two clinical problems exist, blood clots (thrombosis) or pregnancy morbidity."

We get the phosphorus we need through the foods we eat. It is found in many foods and is readily absorbed by the digestive tract. Most of the body's phosphates combine with calcium to help form bones and teeth. Smaller amounts are found in muscle and nerve tissue. The rest is found within cells throughout the body, where they are mainly used to store energy.
Normally, only about 1% of total body phosphates are present in the blood.   A wide variety of foods, such as beans, peas and nuts, cereals, dairy products, eggs, beef, chicken, and fish, contain significant amounts of phosphorus. The body maintains phosphorus/phosphate levels in the blood by regulating how much it absorbs from the intestines and how much it excretes via the kidneys. Phosphate levels are also affected by the interaction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and vitamin D.
Phosphorus deficiencies (hypophosphatemia) may be seen with malnutrition, malabsorption, acid-base imbalances, increased blood calcium, and with disorders that affect kidney function. Phosphorus excesses (hyperphosphatemia) may be seen with increased intake of the mineral, low blood calcium, and with kidney dysfunction.
Someone with a mild to moderate phosphorus deficiency often does not have any symptoms. With a severe phosphorus deficiency, symptoms may include muscle weakness and confusion. An extreme excess of phosphorus may cause symptoms that are similar to those seen with low calcium, including muscle cramps, confusion, and even seizures."

Digoxin is prescribed to relieve some symptoms of heart failure. It strengthens the contractions of the heart and helps it to pump blood more efficiently. Digoxin also helps control the heart rate and abnormal heart rhythms known as arrhythmias. It will not cure heart failure or arrhythmias, which are long-term (chronic) conditions, but can help to manage the symptoms along with diet, exercise, and other medications.
Digoxin levels must be monitored because the drug has a narrow safety range. If the level in the blood is too low, symptoms may recur. If the level is too high, toxicity may occur. Digoxin dosage may be adjusted based on levels measured."

They check for specific proteins on the outside surface of the virus called antigens in a test sample taken from the nostril or the area at the back of the nose. The presence of these antigens is a sign of an active infection.
https://labtestsonline.org/tests/covid-19-antigen-test,COVID-19 Antigen Test,[],[],"May 26, 2021.","May 26, 2021.",When should I get a COVID-19 antigen test?,"There are various times when an antigen test for COVID-19 may be appropriate.
For diagnosis, an antigen test is most often used when PCR tests are not readily available. In these situations, a positive antigen test can be used to diagnose COVID-19 if your symptoms are strongly indicative of the disease.
Antigen tests are more often used for screening for COVID-19. Screening programs are typically designed to prevent the spread of the virus by people who are asymptomatic. Some of the situations in which screening may be beneficial include:  When you have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19
When you have attended large social gatherings or otherwise been in places at high risk for virus transmission
When you either live or work in places where many people live together such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, or correctional facilities
When you need proof of a negative test in order to travel, work, or engage in other activities  Frequent and repeat screening with antigen tests may help identify people with COVID-19 who can then be isolated so that they do not infect other people.
Other factors that can affect when you should consider antigen testing include the likelihood of infection and timing of possible virus exposure: Likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection: When it is unlikely that you have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and the prevalence of the virus in your community is low, there is a greater risk of testing positive when you don’t actually have COVID-19, which is called a false positive.
Timing of potential SARS-CoV-2 exposure: Antigens, which are a part of the virus, can't easily be detected when the viral load is low, such as before symptoms develop, in early disease stage, or as the virus is cleared by the body. Therefore, there is a high chance of a negative result when you are actually infected, which is known as a false negative when tested during these times. Because antigen tests can deliver results quickly and cost less than PCR tests, they can be useful for screening programs. In these programs, people who test positive can be promptly isolated from others, but a second test with a PCR or other molecular test may be needed to confirm the diagnosis."

Individual tests are usually available for less than $50 when purchased without a prescription. If an antigen test is prescribed by a doctor, its cost may be covered by insurance except for any copays or deductibles required by your plan.
At-home antigen tests are available for around $25 for each individual test, although you may have to purchase packs of multiple test kits."

For this reason, carefully following test instructions is essential.
False positive results can show the presence of SARS-CoV-2 when no virus is actually present. The risk of false positives is highest when a person has limited potential contact with the virus, such as in areas with low levels of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
False negative results can show no signs of SARS-CoV-2 when a person is actually infected. This most frequently occurs when a person is tested too soon or too late after being infected.  Because of the possibility of false positives or negatives, the results of antigen tests may be confirmed with molecular tests like a PCR. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has established an algorithm for health professionals to help determine when confirmatory testing is recommended."

It is normally found in very small amounts in the blood. This test measures the amount of allergen-specific IgE in the blood in order to detect an allergy to a particular substance.
IgE is an antibody that functions as part of the body's immune system, its defense against ""intruders."" When someone with a predisposition to allergies is exposed to a potential allergen such as food, grass, or animal dander for the first time, that person becomes sensitized. The person's body perceives the potential allergen as a foreign substance and produces a specific IgE antibody that binds to specialized mast cells in the skin, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as to basophils (a type of white blood cell) in the bloodstream. With the next exposure, these attached IgE antibodies recognize the allergen and cause the mast and basophil cells to release histamine and other chemicals, resulting in an allergic reaction that begins at the exposure site.
A total IgE test measures the overall number of IgE antibodies in the blood, while a specific IgE test measures for a response to individual allergens. Each allergen-specific IgE antibody test performed is separate and very specific; for example, it will test honeybee versus bumblebee, egg white versus egg yolk, and giant ragweed versus western ragweed. Groupings of these tests, such as food panels or regional weed, grass, and mold panels, can be done. Alternatively, the healthcare practitioner may pick and choose selectively from a long list of individual allergens suspected of causing a person's allergies.
While the traditional method for blood testing was the RAST (radioallergosorbent test), it has been largely replaced with newer IgE-specific immunoassay methods. Some healthcare practitioners continue to refer to all IgE allergy blood tests as RAST even though it is not the exact assay that the testing laboratory uses."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/histamine,Histamine,[],[],"March 23, 2017.","May 6, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Histamine is a substance that is released from specialized cells called mast cells when they are activated, often as part of an allergic immune response. This test measures the amount of histamine in the blood or urine.
Mast cells are large tissue cells found throughout the body. They are present mainly in the skin, the lining of the intestine and air passages, and the bone marrow. Mast cells are part of the body's normal response to injury as well as allergic (hypersensitivity) responses. They contain granules that store a number of chemicals, including histamine and tryptase, which are released when mast cells become activated. Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms in persons with allergies.
Concentrations of histamine in the blood and urine are normally very low. Significant increases can be seen in people with a severe allergic reaction and in those with a disorder in which the number of mast cells increase (proliferate) and/or activate without apparent allergies.
The activation of many mast cells is associated with a severe form of acute allergic reaction termed anaphylaxis, which can cause hives (blisters on the skin), reddening of the skin (flushing), low blood pressure, severe narrowing of the air passages, and even death. With anaphylaxis, histamine concentrations in the blood increase rapidly, rising within 10 minutes of the start of symptoms and returning to normal within about 30 to 60 minutes. This increased production is also reflected a short time later in the urine as histamine and its primary metabolite, N-methylhistamine, are excreted.
Histamine and tryptase levels may be persistently increased in people with mastocytosis. This rare condition is associated with abnormal proliferation of mast cells and their infiltration and accumulation in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) and/or in organs throughout the body (systemic mastocytosis)."

This test measures the amount of DCP in the blood to help evaluate whether treatment for one type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is effective.
DCP can be produced by liver tumors, and levels are frequently elevated in conjunction with related tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3% when a person has HCC or has an increased risk of HCC recurrence. This makes the test potentially useful as a tumor marker.
According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 3 of 4 cancers that originate in the liver. ACS estimates that over 40,000 new liver cancers are diagnosed in the U.S. each year and about 29,000 people will die of the disease. The incidence in the U.S. has more than tripled since 1980. Liver cancer is much more common in other parts of the world, with more than 700,000 people diagnosed each year.
Most cases of HCC develop in people who have chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. In the U.S., the most common risk factor for HCC is a chronic hepatitis C infection; worldwide it is chronic hepatitis B. When it occurs, HCC may emerge several decades after the initial infection. HCC affects more men than women, with the average age of diagnosis at 62 years. Symptoms of HCC, such as a liver mass, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, ascites, jaundice, and a worsening of symptoms in those with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, are often not present until the later stages of the disease. For this reason, HCC is rarely detected early unless screening is done in those who are at high risk.
It was hoped that DCP testing would prove useful as a screening and surveillance tool to help with early HCC detection in those with chronic liver disease, but studies have shown mixed results and a recent guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends that it not be used for this purpose."

A transferrin test directly measures the level in the blood. Alternatively, transferrin may be measured indirectly (or converted by calculation) so that its level is expressed as the amount of iron it is capable of binding. This is called the total iron binding capacity (TIBC).
Iron is an essential nutrient that, among other functions, is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). It is a critical part of hemoglobin, the protein in RBCs that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases oxygen as blood circulates to other parts of the body. The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.
Normally, iron is transported throughout the body by transferrin, which is produced by the liver. In healthy people, most iron is incorporated into the hemoglobin within RBCs. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used for other purposes (e.g., to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes).
The transferrin test, TIBC, UIBC, and transferrin saturation, along with other iron tests, help evaluate the amount of iron in the body by measuring several substances in the blood. These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload. Serum iron test—measures the total amount of iron in the liquid portion of the blood, nearly all of which is bound to transferrin.
Transferrin test—directly measures the level of transferrin in the blood. The level depends upon liver function and a person's nutritional status. Transferrin is a protein that may decrease during any inflammatory process and is referred to as a negative acute phase reactant.
TIBC (total iron-binding capacity)—measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by proteins in the blood. Since transferrin is the primary iron-binding protein, the TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin availability—the amount of transferrin that is available to bind to iron. (Note: Though TIBC is a reflection of the amount of transferrin available, TIBC and transferrin are not synonymous.)
UIBC (unsaturated iron-binding capacity)—this test determines the reserve capacity of transferrin, i.e., the portion of transferrin that has not yet been saturated with iron.
Transferrin saturation— dividing the iron concentration by the TIBC produces an estimate of how many of transferrin iron-binding sites are occupied; this is called the transferrin saturation. Under normal conditions, transferrin is typically one-third saturated with iron. This means that about two-thirds of its capacity is held in reserve. (Less commonly, the iron concentration may be divided by the transferrin concentration, not the TIBC. This similar estimate is usually called the transferrin index.)
Ferritin—measures the level of ferritin, a protein made by almost all cells in response to increased iron. The ferritin level reflects the total body iron. It will be low when there is iron deficiency and high when there is an excess of iron in the body. When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because: There is an increased need for iron, for example during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer)
Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, smaller and paler red cells). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms may not appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. Read the article on Anemia to learn more.
Conversely, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a rare genetic disease in which the body absorbs and builds up too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overload can occur when a person undergoes repeated blood transfusions."

A hemoglobinopathy evaluation is a group of tests that determines the presence and relative amounts of abnormal forms of hemoglobin in order to screen for and/or diagnose a hemoglobin disorder.
Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that binds to oxygen in the lungs and allows RBCs to carry the oxygen throughout the body, delivering it to the body's cells and tissues. Hemoglobin consists of one portion called heme, which is the molecule with iron at the center, and another portion made up of four globin (protein) chains. Depending on their structure, the globin chains, depending on their structure, have different designations: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The types of globin chains that are present are important in the function of hemoglobin and its ability to transport oxygen.
Normal hemoglobin types include: Hemoglobin A: makes up about 95%-98% of Hb found in adults; it contains two alpha and two beta protein chains.
Hemoglobin A2:  makes up about 2%-3% of Hb in adults; it has two alpha and two delta protein chains.
Hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin): makes up to 1%-2% of Hb found in adults; it has two alpha and two gamma protein chains. This is the primary hemoglobin produced by the fetus during pregnancy; its production usually falls shortly after birth and reaches adult levels by 1-2 years. Hemoglobinopathies occur when changes (variants) in the genes that provide information for making the globin chains cause changes in the proteins. These genetic variants may result in a reduced production of one of the normal globin chains or in the production of structurally altered globin chains. Approximately 7% of the world's population carry at least one copy of a genetic variant in one of the hemoglobin chains (carrier), and the rate can vary dramatically based on ethnicity. Genetic variants may affect the structure of the hemoglobin, its behavior, its production rate, and/or its stability. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin within RBCs can alter the appearance (size and shape) and function of the red blood cells.
Red blood cells containing abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin variants) may not carry oxygen efficiently and may be broken down by the body sooner than usual (a shortened survival), resulting in hemolytic anemia.
While there are more than 1,000 hemoglobinopathies currently described and novel forms are still being discovered, some of the most common hemoglobin variants include: Hemoglobin S, the primary hemoglobin in people with sickle cell disease that causes the RBC to become misshapen (sickle), decreasing the cell's survival
Hemoglobin C, which can cause a minor amount of hemolytic anemia
Hemoglobin E, which may cause no symptoms or generally mild symptoms Thalassemia is a condition in which a gene variant results in reduced production of one of the globin chains. This can upset the balance of alpha to beta chains, leading to decrease in hemoglobin A, causing abnormal forms of hemoglobin to form (alpha thalassemia) or causing an increase of minor hemoglobin components, such as Hb A2 or Hb F (beta thalassemia).
Hemoglobinopathies can be thought of as an alteration of quality of the hemoglobin molecule (how well it functions), while thalassemias are an alteration of quantity.
Many other less common hemoglobin variants exist. Some are silent – causing no signs or symptoms – while others affect the function and/or stability of the hemoglobin molecule.
To learn more about these conditions, read the articles on Hemoglobin Abnormalities and Thalassemia.
A hemoglobinopathy evaluation typically involves tests that determine the types and amounts of hemoglobin. Information from these tests, along with results from routine tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear, aid in establishing a diagnosis."

In general, tests to measure cholesterol typically begin as an adult, usually around 35 years old.
Screening
Health screening is a way of proactively looking for potential problems before symptoms become apparent. Cholesterol tests are often used in this way to identify people who may have an above-average risk of cardiovascular problems.
There are no consensus guidelines for when to do cholesterol screening. Based on different views of the benefits and downsides of screening, expert groups have varying recommendations for when to start screening and how frequently to do repeat tests.
In general, screening occurs less often in people who do not have risk factors for cardiovascular problems. In low-risk patients, screening with a lipid panel test may begin in their 20s, 30s, or 40s and be repeated about every five years. If results are normal, screening may continue with only measurements of total cholesterol and HDL.
People with risk factors tend to start screening at a younger age and have screening tests more frequently. Some risk factors for cardiovascular disease include:  Being over 45 years old for men and over 50-55 for women
High cholesterol on a previous test
Prior cardiovascular problems
Being overweight or obese
Cigarette smoking
Unhealthy diet
Lack of regular physical activity
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Having a first-degree relative who had heart disease at an early age (under 55 in men and under 65 in women)
Diabetes or prediabetes Depending on your risk factors and ongoing test results, you may have cholesterol tests every year or less.
Children over the age of two usually start screening as soon as any risk factors are identified. Children that don’t have risk factors often have cholesterol testing before and after puberty. Screening is more frequent in children who have an elevated risk of an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolemia.
A summary reviewing general approaches to cholesterol screening is listed below. In the majority of cases, screening is done with a lipid test that measures total cholesterol as well as HDL, LDL, and triglycerides.   Demographic Group

Diagnosis
Changes to cholesterol levels can occur as a result of other health conditions, including some that affect the pancreas, kidney, or thyroid. As a result, cholesterol testing may be part of the diagnostic workup for those conditions."

Test kits that include an at-home method for analyzing the blood sample from your finger. This may be a small electronic device or a test strip that changes color to indicate cholesterol levels.  At-home tests for total cholesterol may include other cholesterol measurements, such as HDL and LDL, that are part of a typical lipid panel."

The cost depends on where you take the test as well as coverage that may be provided by your insurance.
Costs of testing can include the office visit, the fee for the technician to draw your blood, and the actual laboratory analysis. If your doctor recommends a cholesterol test, these costs are typically covered by insurance, but, depending on your plan, you may be responsible for copays or a deductible. Your doctor and insurance plan can provide more specific information about your costs for cholesterol testing.
A point-of-care cholesterol test at pharmacies or health clinics may cost around $100 or less. This kind of test may be free at community health fairs or similar events.
There is a wide price range for at-home test kits. Many models include a small device to conduct the test and cost under $150, but more expensive options are available. Kits commonly come with extra test strips that allow you to check your cholesterol more than once."

Although no test is perfect, laboratories follow strict protocols that help standardize cholesterol tests and make their results dependable. When these procedures and pre-test instructions are followed, inaccurate results are unlikely.
Point-of-care and at-home cholesterol tests are relatively accurate but are subject to more variation than laboratory testing. If abnormal results are found on one of these tests, follow-up testing by a laboratory is commonly recommended."

The exact schedule for testing depends on your situation and likely involves a full lipid panel or measurement of HDL along with total cholesterol.
If you are not at high risk for cardiovascular problems and have had normal cholesterol levels in the past, follow-up testing is usually done every five years.
More specific or specialized tests may be needed in some circumstances. For example, the doctor may order a test to directly measure your levels of bad (LDL) cholesterol. Expanded lipid testing or non-laboratory tests like a cardiac stress test may be used as a way of evaluating your overall heart health.
Follow-up testing with a lipid panel and/or other tests is expected if you are found to have high cholesterol on an at-home or point-of-care test.

New technologies have made point-of-care and at-home tests more widely available. When their instructions are correctly followed, these tests have nearly the same accuracy as laboratory tests.
For at-home and point-of-care tests, blood is taken from your fingertip instead of from a vein in your arm. Because results do not need to be sent to a laboratory, results are provided within minutes instead of days.
Laboratory testing is considered to be standard and is what doctors rely on to make medical decisions. That said, at-home and point-of-care tests are convenient and may help with ongoing monitoring of cholesterol.

Lactose is a sugar with a complex structure (a disaccharide). It is found in milk and many other dairy products. Before it can be absorbed and used by the body, it must be broken down into two simpler sugars, glucose and galactose (monosaccharides). This digestion step is performed by lactase, an enzyme produced by cells lining the small intestine.
If an individual does not produce enough lactase (lactase deficient), then undigested lactose passes through the small intestine to the large intestine, where bacteria break it down, producing hydrogen gas and lactic acid. This process can cause the affected person to experience abdominal pain and bloating, flatulence (passing gas), and diarrhea within 30 minutes to 2 hours of consuming milk or other dairy products.
Almost all babies are born with the ability to digest lactose, but lactase production normally decreases as an individual ages. About 65-70% of the world's population develops some degree of lactose intolerance by the time they reach adulthood. The intolerance can vary by race and ethnicity. While only about 5% of northern Europeans are lactose intolerant, more than 90% of Asians and Native Americans become lactose intolerant.
Two different types of lactose tolerance tests are available. In both of these, the person tested is given a liquid to drink that contains a standard amount of lactose. A sample for testing is taken immediately before, and a series of timed samples is collected at intervals after taking the lactose drink.
Hydrogen breath test
This is the test more commonly used to detect and diagnose lactose intolerance. This test measures hydrogen gas in breath samples taken before and after the lactose drink. With lactose intolerance, undigested lactose reaches the large intestine and is broken down by bacteria, producing excess hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas enters the circulation and is eventually exhaled by the lungs and can be measured in the breath.
Glucose blood test
This is an alternate test sometimes used to detect and diagnose lactose intolerance. This test measures the glucose level in the blood samples taken immediately before and after the lactose drink. Since lactose is normally broken down to glucose and galactose, taking the lactose drink would normally lead to absorption of this glucose and result in an increase in blood glucose. In persons with lactose intolerance, there is inadequate breakdown of lactose and so this rise in blood glucose is not seen."

A person who drinks more than one drink an hour will have an increased level of ethanol in the blood. However, certain factors affect the metabolism of alcohol, especially the amount of food consumed prior to and during drinking. The rate of metabolism can also vary with age, gender, weight, concurrent medications, and genetic status.
Drinking alcoholic beverages faster than the liver can process can result in an elevated level of ethanol in the blood. This leads to signs and symptoms of intoxication such as bloodshot eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, slow response to questions or comments, impaired judgment, decreased motor skills, drowsiness or falling asleep, and/or vomiting.
With a very high blood ethanol, more serious signs and symptoms of toxicity may appear such as confusion, stupor, staggering, irregular or slow breathing, loss of consciousness, seizures, and low body temperature (hypothermia). A very high blood ethanol can be fatal.
Long-term, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of several medical problems such as liver disease, cardiovascular problems, depression and anxiety. (Read more about this in the article on Alcoholism.)"

The other major thyroid hormone is called thyroxine (T4) and together they help control the rate at which the body uses energy. Almost all of the T3 (and T4) found in the blood is bound to protein. The rest is free (unbound) and is the biologically active form of the hormone. Tests can measure the amount of free T3 or the total T3 (bound plus unbound) in the blood.
Most of the hormone produced by the thyroid is T4. This hormone is relatively inactive, but it is converted into the much more active T3 in the liver and other tissues.
T3 levels are regulated by the feedback system that the body uses to maintain stable amounts of thyroid hormones in the blood. T4 and TSH, along with its regulatory hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which comes from the hypothalamus, are also part of the feedback system. When blood levels of thyroid hormones decline, the pituitary gland produces and releases TSH in response to TRH stimulation. TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and/or release more T4 and T3.
When thyroid hormone levels increase in the blood, the pituitary gland produces less TSH and the thyroid produces less T4 and T3. When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of T4 and T3, then the person affected may have symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as nervousness, tremors of the hands, weight loss, insomnia, and puffiness around dry, irritated eyes and in some cases, bulging eyes. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. (See the article on Graves Disease.)
If the thyroid gland produces insufficient amounts of T4 and T3, then the person may have signs and symptoms associated with underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and a slowed metabolism, such as weight gain, dry skin, fatigue, and constipation. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. (See the article on Hashimoto Thyroiditis for more details.)
Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and excessive or deficient production of TSH. The effect of these conditions on thyroid hormone production can be detected and monitored by measuring the free T3 or sometimes total T3."

CMV testing detects antibodies in the blood that the body produces in response to the infection or detects CMV directly.
In the United States, as many as 60% of people have been exposed to CMV at some point in their life. Almost 1 out of every 3 children have been exposed to CMV by age 5 and more than half of adults are exposed to CMV by age 40.
Most people are infected as children or as young adults, but many don't know it because CMV usually does not cause noticeable symptoms or only mild illness in otherwise healthy people. Individuals with mild illness may have non-specific signs and symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, tiredness, and swollen glands. In otherwise healthy adults, CMV infection may sometimes cause a flu-like illness or signs and symptoms similar to mononucleosis (mono), such as extreme fatigue, fever, chills, body aches, and/or headaches that usually resolve within a few weeks.
CMV is found in many body fluids during an active infection, including saliva, urine, blood, breast milk, semen, vaginal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. CMV easily spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected or by contact with contaminated body fluids or objects, such as diapers or toys.
Once you are infected, CMV remains in your body for the rest of your life without causing symptoms. After your initial ""primary"" infection resolves, CMV becomes dormant or latent, like other members of the herpes family. However, if your immune system is significantly weakened, the virus can become active again (reactivate) and cause illness.
CMV can cause notable health problems in these situations: A pregnant woman who is infected for the first time (primary infection) during pregnancy can pass the infection to her developing baby across the placenta. This can cause serious physical and developmental problems in the baby. Most newborns (about 90%) who are infected appear healthy at birth but may develop hearing or vision problems, pneumonia, seizures, and/or delayed mental development a few months later. A few babies may be stillborn, while others may have symptoms at birth such as jaundice, anemia, an enlarged spleen or liver, and a small head.
CMV can cause serious illness and death in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients, and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. These individuals might experience the most severe symptoms and their CMV infection may remain active. CMV may reactivate in those who were previously exposed. The infection could affect the:
Eyes, causing inflammation of the retina, which can lead to blindness
Digestive tract, causing bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain
Lungs, causing pneumonia with a non-productive cough and shortness of breath
Brain, causing encephalitis
Spleen and liver
Organ or bone marrow transplants, causing some degree of rejection  Active CMV also further depresses the immune system, allowing other secondary infections such as fungal infections, to occur."

The international normalized ratio or INR is a calculation based on results of a PT that is used to monitor individuals who are being treated with the blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant) warfarin (Coumadin®).
A PT measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in your sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. The PT is often performed along with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and together they assess the amount and function of proteins called coagulation factors that are an important part of proper blood clot formation.
In the body, when there is an injury and bleeding occurs, the clotting process called hemostasis begins. This process involves in part a series of sequential chemical reactions called the coagulation cascade, in which coagulation or ""clotting"" factors are activated one after another and result in the formation of a clot. There must be a sufficient quantity of each coagulation factor, and each must function properly, in order for normal clotting to occur. Too little can lead to excessive bleeding; too much may lead to excessive clotting.
In a test tube during a laboratory test, there are two ""pathways"" that can initiate clotting, the so-called extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Both of these then merge into a common pathway to complete the clotting process. The PT test evaluates how well all of the coagulation factors in the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade work together. Included are: factors I (Fibrinogen), II (Prothrombin), V, VII and X.
The PT/INR may be done at the same time as a PTT, which evaluates the clotting factors that are part of the intrinsic and common pathways: XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK). The PT and PTT evaluate the overall ability to produce a clot in a reasonable amount of time and, if any of these factors are deficient in quantity or not functioning properly, the test results will be prolonged.
The PT is usually measured in seconds and is compared to a normal range that reflects PT values in healthy individuals. Because the reagents used to perform the PT test vary from one laboratory to another and even within the same laboratory over time, the normal ranges also will fluctuate. To standardize results across different laboratories in the U.S. and the world, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee developed and recommended the use of the Internationalized Normalized Ratio (INR), calculated based on the PT test result, for people who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin®). Warfarin is prescribed for people with a variety of conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and some cardiovascular diseases (CVD) like atrial fibrillation to ""thin"" their blood and prevent inappropriate clotting.
The INR is a calculation that adjusts for changes in the PT reagents and allows for results from different laboratories to be compared. Most laboratories report both PT and INR values whenever a PT test is performed. The INR should be only applicable, however, for those taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/leptin,Leptin,[],[],"June 29, 2017.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Leptin is a hormone that helps regulate appetite by signaling hunger satisfaction (satiety). This test measures the amount of leptin in the blood to detect a deficiency that may be contributing to obesity.
Leptin is produced primarily by fat cells (adipocytes) and to a lesser degree by other tissues, including the placenta in pregnant women. It is transported in the blood receptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. When sufficient food has been consumed, it tells the body that it is no longer hungry. In a normal feedback response, a low level of leptin triggers hunger and an increase in food consumption. As the level of leptin rises from an increase in fat cells, hunger diminishes and food consumption drops off.
Insufficient leptin can cause persistent hunger as the body attempts to protect itself from perceived underfeeding (starvation). Very rare inherited leptin deficiencies can cause severe obesity through constant hunger and constant eating that starts in early childhood. Leptin replacement therapy has been shown to be successful in treating some of those affected.
Obesity is most commonly associated with elevated leptin levels. This is thought to be due to a resistance to leptin that is similar to the insulin resistance often seen with obesity. People who are affected are resistant to the action of leptin—they continue to experience hunger even after consuming sufficient food. The body continues to produce more leptin in an attempt to compensate and in response to the perceived hunger. However, about 10% of those who are obese are estimated to have some degree of leptin deficiency.
There is significant interest in better understanding leptin's ties to obesity. Obesity is a major health concern in the U.S. because it increases the risk of many conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), dyslipidemias (high cholesterol and/or high triglycerides), type 2 diabetes, joint problems, sleep apnea, coronary heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. The rate of obesity has increased steadily over the last 20 years in all age ranges and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of adults and 17% of children and teens in this country are currently classified as obese. Classification is based on body mass index or BMI. (See Common Questions below).
A recent study found that in some people a leptin level might be more accurate than the traditional body mass index in gauging how much excess fat a person is carrying. In general, the higher the level of leptin in the bloodstream, the more fat tissue a person has. In the study, this was especially true with older women and in those with large muscles or dense bones where the results of the BMI score could be misleading.
Research is ongoing to evaluate leptin's roles in the body and the links between leptin and obesity, and between leptin and successful weight loss. There is also continued interest in determining whether a leptin-based treatment might be useful for those who are obese and leptin-deficient."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/peritoneal-fluid-analysis,Peritoneal Fluid Analysis,[],[],"November 2, 2016.","September 22, 2020.",What is being tested?,"Peritoneal fluid is a liquid that acts as a lubricant in the abdominal cavity. It is found in small quantities (generally 5-20 mL) between the layers of the peritoneum that line the abdominal wall. Peritoneal fluid acts to moisten the outside of the organs and to reduce the friction of organ movement during digestion and movement.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and/or excessive accumulation of peritoneal fluid (peritoneal effusion or ascites). Peritoneal fluid analysis is a group of tests that evaluate this liquid to determine the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons that fluid may collect in the abdominal cavity are: An imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels—which drives fluid out of blood vessels—and the amount of protein in blood—which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis.
An injury or inflammation of the peritoneum, in which case the fluid is called an exudate. This type of fluid may be the result of conditions such as infection, malignancies (metastatic cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma), pancreatitis, ruptured gallbladder, or autoimmune disease. Determining the type of fluid present (transudate or exudates) is important because it helps narrow down the possible causes of fluid buildup or inflammation. Healthcare practitioners and laboratorians use an initial set of tests, including cell count, serum and fluid albumin levels, and appearance of the fluid, to distinguish between transudates and exudates. Once the fluid is determined to be one or the other, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing ascites."

These tests typically include: Fluid albumin level—the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) calculation (serum albumin level minus the fluid albumin level) may be used to differentiate between transudates and exudates. A SAAG level of 1.1 g/dL or greater suggests the presence of a transudate and less than 1.1 g/dL, an exudate."

Triglycerides move via the blood from the gut to adipose tissue for storage. In between meals, triglycerides are released from fat tissue to be used as an energy source for the body. Most triglycerides are carried in the blood by lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).
High levels of triglycerides in the blood are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood.

Others include high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Each one of these particles contains a mixture of cholesterol, protein, and triglyceride but in varying amounts unique to each type of particle. LDL contains the highest amount of cholesterol. HDL contains the highest amount of protein. VLDL contains the highest amount of triglyceride. Since VLDL contains most of the circulating triglyceride and since the compositions of the different particles are relatively constant, it is possible to estimate the amount of VLDL-cholesterol by dividing the triglyceride value (in mg/dL) by 5. At present, there is no simple, direct way of measuring VLDL-cholesterol, so the estimate calculated from triglyceride is used in most settings. This calculation is not valid when the triglyceride is greater than 400 mg/dL. Increased levels of VLDL-cholesterol have been found to be associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke."

However, in rare cases, a person may have an extremely high level of triglycerides (well above 1000 mg/dL) sustained over time and the individual may experience repeated bouts of acute pancreatitis. Some of the signs and symptoms include pain in the upper half of the stomach area that develops suddenly and then gradually gets worse, fever, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes jaundice. A person with severely high levels may also develop lesions on the skin called xanthomas. These typically appear as several small, round, solid, yellow bumps mostly on the back, chest, buttocks, shoulders and thighs."

It consists of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) molecule with another protein (Apolipoprotein (a)) attached to it. This test measures the Lp(a) level in the blood to help evaluate your risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Like LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol), Lp(a) is considered a risk factor for CVD. However, Lp(a) does not respond to typical strategies to lower LDL cholesterol such as diet, exercise, or most lipid-lowering medications, such as statins. The amount of Lp(a) that you have is determined by the genes you inherited, and it remains relatively constant over your lifetime. A high level of Lp(a) is thought to contribute to your overall risk of CVD, making this test potentially useful as a cardiovascular risk marker.
The protein portion of Lp(a) consists of: Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) – a protein that is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of lipids and is the main protein constituent of lipoproteins such as LDL and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
Apolipoprotein (a) – a second protein component, which is attached to the Apo B. Apolipoprotein (a) has an unusual structure and is thought to inhibit clots from being broken down normally. The size of the apolipoprotein(a) portion of Lp(a) varies in size from person to person and tends to be smaller in Caucasians than in those of African ancestry. The significance of the variation in size in contributing to CVD risk is complex, but there is some evidence that smaller size increases risk. Most Lp(a) tests do not measure the size of apolipoprotein (a) because they measure and report only the level of Lp(a) in blood. Since about 50% of the people who have heart attacks have a normal cholesterol level, researchers have sought other factors that may have an influence on heart disease. It is thought that Lp(a) may be one such factor. Lp(a) has two potential ways to contribute to heart risk:  Lp(a) can promote deposits of LDL cholesterol in blood vessel walls and the formation of plaque on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
Apo(a) has a structure that can inhibit enzymes that dissolve clots, so Lp(a) may promote the formation of clots in the arteries. For these reasons, Lp(a) may be more of a risk factor for atherosclerosis than LDL cholesterol."

Antibodies are proteins generated by the immune system in its response to pathogens such as viruses.
The body produces antibodies that are specific to SARS-CoV-2. Tests can look for types of antibodies known as immunoglobulins including immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and immunoglobulin A (IgA). These antibodies develop at different stages after infection.
While testing is possible for all three of these types of immunoglobulins, most COVID-19 antibody tests focus on IgG or the total number of antibodies. IgG antibodies take several weeks to develop but can last for several months. As a result, they are generally viewed as the most reliable indicator of a prior infection."

Most often, the test is prescribed when you have symptoms that could be related to COVID-19, but the infection is believed to have occurred several weeks or months earlier. In these cases, you may have already tested negative for an active infection with SARS-CoV-2.
You may also get a serology test if you are taking part in a research study. In this situation, you will be advised about the details of the study’s purposes and procedures prior to testing.
Antibody tests cannot be used to show if you are immune to COVID-19. They also cannot prove whether vaccination was effective. Not enough is known about the relationship between antibody levels and immunity, and for this reason the CDC advises against using antibody tests in these contexts.
When serology testing is conducted, it is important to consider the time it takes for the immune system to produce antibodies. It often takes several weeks for antibodies to become detectable, so an antibody test too soon after infection may not be accurate. In addition, although antibodies have been detected for around eight months after infection in some people, they may last for a shorter period of time in others."

In general, though, most authorized antibody tests provide dependable results.
While the test methods can reliably determine if antibodies are present, several factors can affect the accuracy of both the test and its interpretation:  Cross-reactivity: SARS-CoV-2 is one type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses are common, and it is possible for the test to mistakenly identify antibodies to one of those coronaviruses as antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
Test timing: It can take several weeks for antibodies to form, which means that testing too soon after infection may return a false negative result. In addition, antibodies decline over time, so testing too late may not correctly reflect whether you had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Vaccination status: Getting a vaccine for COVID-19 causes the body to produce antibodies to a specific part of SARS-CoV-2 known as its spike protein. In serology tests that look for these specific antibodies, vaccination may cause a positive result. The presence of antibodies to other proteins in SARS-CoV-2 may be an indicator of a past infection rather than a result of vaccination, so it is important to note which type of antibodies are being tested."

Antigens are proteins on the surface of the virus while antibodies are created by the immune system to help fight the virus. Antigens are detectable soon after infection when lots of the virus is present in the body, which is why they can detect active infections.
In addition, antigen tests are conducted with a sample taken from the nose while antibody tests are done with a blood sample."

The antibodies that are attached to the surface of the RBCs are responsible for their destruction.
There are a few reasons why RBCs may be attacked by antibodies: Following a blood transfusion: If someone receives a donor's blood that does not fully match their own type, their body will make antibodies that recognize the donor's RBC as foreign. (For more on blood types, see the article on Blood Typing.) These antibodies will attack donor’s RBCs and destroy them. People who have many blood transfusions are more likely to make antibodies to RBCs because they are exposed to more foreign RBC. If someone shows symptoms of a reaction after a transfusion, a DAT will be performed to determine if those antibodies have attached to RBCs.
Mother/baby blood type incompatibility: A mother and baby may have different blood types if the baby inherits a blood type from the father. During pregnancy or labor, the mother may be exposed to the baby's RBCs. These RBCs may be recognized by the mother’s immune system as foreign and she will produce antibodies directed against the baby's RBC. A baby’s RBCs might be covered with antibodies that cross the placenta from the mother’s blood into the baby’s circulation. These antibodies will destroy the baby's circulating RBCs and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). A DAT is performed on the blood of a baby to determine if the antibodies have attached to the baby's RBCs.
This may occur when an Rh-positive baby is born to an Rh-negative mother. This type of incompatibility usually does not affect the first baby but affects subsequent children. (For more on blood types and pregnancy, see the article on Blood Typing and RBC Antibody Screen). Formerly, antibodies to the Rh protein were the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn, but this condition is now rare due to preventive treatments given to the Rh-negative mother during and after each pregnancy. The most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn nowadays is an ABO incompatibility between a Group O mother and her baby. This type of fetal-maternal incompatibility is generally mild. Autoimmune diseases and other conditions: Some people make antibodies that target their own RBCs (autoantibodies). These antibodies are produced because the immune system mistakenly recognizes their own RBCs as foreign. Some examples of conditions that cause this include:
Autoimmune disorders such as lupus
Malignant diseases such as lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Infections such as mycoplasma pneumonia and mononucleosis
Drug-induced anemia: Certain drugs can induce antibodies against RBCs and therefore cause their destruction (hemolysis). This is seen with some antibiotics, such as penicillin, cephalosporins and piperacillin. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about any drugs you have been taking recently. If the healthcare provider suspects drug-induced autoimmune anemia, the suspect medication will be discontinued. Symptoms typically resolve promptly after the drug is discontinued."

Any subsequent Rh-positive children may then be affected by the mother's Rh antibodies. Fortunately, this is now relatively rare as Rh-negative mothers are tested during and after their pregnancy and are given RhIg (RhImmune Globulin, Rhogam) injections to prevent the development of Rh antibodies.

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/antidiuretic-hormone-adh,Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH),"['ADH', 'Vasopressin', 'Arginine Vasopressin', 'AVP']",[],"March 28, 2019.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called arginine vasopressin (AVP), is a hormone that helps regulate water balance in the body by controlling the amount of water the kidneys reabsorb while they are filtering wastes out of the blood. This test measures the amount of ADH in the blood.
ADH is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain and stored in the posterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain. ADH is normally released by the pituitary in response to sensors that detect an increase in blood osmolality (number of dissolved particles in the blood) or decrease in blood volume. The kidneys respond to ADH by conserving water and producing urine that is more concentrated. The retained water dilutes the blood, lowers its osmolality, and increases blood volume and pressure. If this is not sufficient to restore the water balance, then thirst is also stimulated so that the affected person will drink more water.
There are a variety of disorders, conditions, and medications that can affect either the amount of ADH released or the kidneys' response to it. ADH deficiency and excess can cause symptoms and complications that, in rare cases, may become life-threatening.
If there is too little ADH or the kidneys do not respond to ADH, then too much water is lost through the kidneys, the urine produced is more dilute, and the blood becomes more concentrated. This can cause excessive thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, and – if you do not drink enough water to replace what is being lost – high blood sodium.
If there is too much ADH, then water is retained, blood volume increases, and the person may experience nausea, headaches, disorientation, lethargy, and low blood sodium.
The ADH test is not widely used to diagnose these conditions. Often, a diagnosis is made on the basis of medical history and other laboratory tests, such as urine and blood osmolality and electrolytes.
ADH deficiency, also called diabetes insipidus, is caused by a lack of ADH or the kidney's inability to respond to ADH. Central diabetes insipidus is associated with a lack of ADH production by the hypothalamus or release from the pituitary and may be due to a variety of causes, including an inherited genetic defect, head trauma, a brain tumor, or due to an infection that causes encephalitis or meningitis.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus originates in the kidney and is associated with a lack of response to ADH, causing an inability to concentrate urine. It may be inherited or caused by a variety of kidney diseases. Both types of diabetes insipidus lead to large volumes of dilute urine eliminated by the kidneys.
Excessive ADH is seen in ""syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone"" (SIADH) when ADH is released in unregulated quantities. SIADH is caused by inappropriate production of too much ADH, resulting in water retention, low blood sodium, and decreased blood osmolality. The increased production is not due to the normal response to high blood osmolality or low blood volume.
SIADH may be due to a wide number of diseases and conditions that either stimulate excessive ADH production and release or that prevent its suppression.
SIADH may also be seen with cancers that produce ADH or ADH-like substances independent of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands. Regardless of the cause or source, excess ADH causes low blood sodium and osmolality because water is retained and blood volume is increased."

Several blood and urine osmolality measurements are performed at timed intervals before and after vasopressin is given in order to monitor your response to fluid restriction and then to the drug. This procedure must be performed under close medical supervision as it can sometimes lead to severe dehydration and can pose a risk to some people with underlying diseases.

In both children and adults, growth hormone helps regulate the rate at which the body both produces energy from food (metabolism) and makes lipids, proteins, and glucose (sugar). It also helps regulate the production of red blood cells and muscle mass.
Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain behind the bridge of the nose. It is normally released into the blood in pulses throughout the day and night with peaks that occur mostly during the night. Because of this, a single measurement of the level of GH in blood is difficult to interpret and not usually clinically useful. The value will be higher if the sample is taken during a pulse and lower if it is taken during a period between pulses."

Then, under medical supervision, the suppression or stimulation procedure is performed. This may involve the use of an intravenous (IV) infusion. Blood samples are then drawn from a vein (or from the IV) at timed intervals.
Sometimes, a single sample of blood is drawn following a fast and rest or after a period of strenuous exercise."

This test determines how well someone absorbs xylose. It measures the level of xylose in the blood and urine after a standard amount is ingested in order to evaluate the person's ability to absorb carbohydrates in general.
The body digests foods in three stages: first proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are broken down in the stomach by acids and enzymes and then in the small intestines by pancreatic enzymes and bile from the liver. They are then absorbed, primarily in the small intestines, and finally the nutrients are transported throughout the body and used or stored.
If there are not enough bile or pancreatic enzymes available, then carbohydrates and other foods cannot be properly digested. If a condition prevents the intestines from absorbing the nutrients, then they are lost by excretion in the stool. In both cases—improper digestion or absorption—the affected person can experience symptoms associated with malabsorption and, in severe cases, symptoms of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.
This test is not routinely ordered and not widely available. Several major health organizations, including the American Gastroenterology Association, the World Gastroenterology Organization, and the British Society of Gastroenterology, do not include this test in their guidelines for evaluating possible malabsorption."

This test measures the amount of 5-HIAA in the urine or blood.
Serotonin is produced as needed by the nervous system, mainly the brain, but also special cells in the bronchial tubes (lungs) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It helps transmit nerve impulses and constrict blood vessels, participates in the wake-sleep cycle, and affects mood. After it is used by the body, serotonin is broken down in the liver, and its metabolites, including 5-HIAA, are eliminated in the urine.
Ordinarily, only small varying amounts of 5-HIAA are present in the urine. Large quantities of serotonin and 5-HIAA may be produced, however, by some carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing noncancerous or cancerous neuroendocrine masses that can form in the GI tract, especially in the appendix, and in the lungs. About 2 out of every 3 carcinoid tumors are found in the GI tract with most of the rest occurring in the lungs, although they may affect other organs as well.
According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 neuroendocrine tumors or cancers that start in the GI tract and 2,000 to 4,000 that start in the lungs diagnosed each year in the United States. Many more of these tumors may exist, but most remain small and do not cause any symptoms. When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs.
About 10% of carcinoid tumors, primarily those found in the GI tract affecting the liver, will produce enough serotonin to cause symptoms, such as flushing of the face, diarrhea, a rapid heart rate, and wheezing, which are referred to as carcinoid syndrome. The serotonin that causes carcinoid syndrome may be released continuously or intermittently and can lead to significantly increased quantities of 5-HIAA in the blood and urine."

Cortisol is a hormone produced by two small glands that sit atop the kidneys called the adrenal glands. Cortisol plays a role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. It affects blood glucose levels, helps maintain blood pressure, and helps regulate the immune system. Normally, the level of cortisol in the blood rises and falls in a consistent pattern throughout the day (called diurnal variation), peaking shortly after waking, then declining gradually to its lowest level at bedtime.
Production of cortisol by the adrenal glands is regulated by a negative feedback system involving the hypothalamus in the brain and the pituitary gland, a small organ located below the brain. Normally, in a healthy person: When the cortisol level falls, the hypothalamus responds by releasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
CRH signals the pituitary gland to produce ACTH.
ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol.
As the cortisol level rises, the hypothalamus decreases CRH production, the pituitary reduces ACTH production, and the adrenal glands decrease cortisol production. In order for appropriate amounts of cortisol to be made, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands must be functioning and communicating with each other properly.
Decreased cortisol levels may be seen with: Underactive or damaged adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency) that limit cortisol production; this is referred to as primary adrenal insufficiency and is also known as Addison disease.
An underactive pituitary gland or a pituitary gland tumor that inhibits ACTH production; this is known as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Treatment utilizing glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and prednisone. If you have a cortisol test done and the result is low, your healthcare practitioner may do an ACTH stimulation test to help confirm the findings and to help determine its cause.
The most common ACTH stimulation test is the short or rapid test. For this test: Your blood is drawn for an initial, baseline level (pre-stimulation).
You are given an injection of a manufactured fragment of ACTH (cosyntropin or tetracosactide). The manufactured fragment may be injected into a muscle or vein. When the manufactured ACTH fragment is administered, it acts like the body's own ACTH and stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.
Your blood is drawn again after a specified amount of time (30 minutes and/or 60 minutes).
The cortisol level is measured in both the first (baseline) and subsequent samples. 2016 guidelines from the Endocrine Society consider this the best test to establish a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency."

This information is used to predict prognosis by estimating risk of recurrence, and spread (metastasis) of the cancer, as well as to guide treatment. These tests are relatively new, but their use is increasing. They are ultimately aimed at developing a personalized approach to patient care and breast cancer therapy.
Cancers represent uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells that arise due to multiple factors, including malfunctioning proteins that normally keep cell growth in check. The proteins usually malfunction as a result of an acquired mutation in the DNA that contains the instructions for making the proteins. As noted above, genes control the production of RNA. RNA controls the production of proteins, and proteins in turn promote and regulate growth and the rate of reactions in the body. This entire process is referred to as gene expression. Many cellular processes are comprised of a series of steps, with key enzymes (specialized proteins) required to move through each step. Mutations in key genes may result in changes to how a step proceeds (or doesn't) and may cause a change to the end product or any intermediate product along the pathway.
Genetic mutations can result in abnormal or absent protein, which in turn may lead to unregulated cell growth and division, eventually causing them to invade healthy tissues and become cancerous. Normally, there is a delicate balance between cells, but cancer cells can often ""invade"" and take over other tissues and may not undergo programmed cell death as they should when growing out of control. Cancer cells and tumors are genetically different from the healthy cells around them.
Each individual breast cancer has different genetic mutations that distinguishes it from the normal tissue. The mutation(s) in cancer cells and the change to the expression of those genes regulate how rapidly the tumor grows, its likelihood of metastasizing and moving throughout the body, whether or not its growth is supported by the hormones estrogen or progesterone, whether it over-expresses certain proteins such as HER2, and how responsive it will be to different treatments.
Through gene expression, breast tumor genes regulate the timing and quantity of production of gene-specific RNA and proteins. Patterns in gene expression include both the increase and/or decrease in the expression of genes (upregulation and downregulation) that are responsible for the production of RNA and proteins. Rather than evaluating a single gene, multiparameter gene expression tests analyze the RNA of multiple genes in a tumor at the same time. The result is a pattern of gene expression that is consolidated into a score and/or profile. This information is then used to help predict the likely behavior of the tumor and its response to treatment."

Autoantibodies are produced when a person's immune system mistakenly targets and attacks the body's own tissues. This attack can cause inflammation, tissue damage, and other signs and symptoms that are associated with an autoimmune disorder.
Certain autoimmune disorders are characteristically associated with the presence of one or more anti-ENA antibodies. Autoantibody association can aid in the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder and help distinguish between other autoimmune disorders.
The ENA panel typically consists of a group of 4 or 6 autoantibody tests. The number of tests performed will depend on the laboratory and the needs of the healthcare practitioners and patients it serves. Individual ENA panel tests can also be ordered separately.

Approximately 20 millions new STD infections occur each year in the U.S. Half of all STD diagnoses occur in adolescents and young adults between the ages of 15 and 24 years."
https://labtestsonline.org/std-testing,STD Testing,[],[],"May 20, 2021.","May 20, 2021.",Who should get testing?,"Many people with STDs are asymptomatic or experience only mild symptoms of infection. Without testing, people infected with STDs may unknowingly spread the infection to others. STDs can lead to serious health complications, so appropriate STD screening and diagnosis is a major public health concern.
The goal of screening for STDs is to identify and treat people with infections before they develop complications and before they spread disease to others. Additionally, screening attempts to identify, test, and treat the sexual partners of people diagnosed with STDs to prevent continued spread of the infection.
While all sexually active people are at risk for STDs, not every person needs to be screened for each STD. STD screening focuses on people who are at a high risk of becoming infected due to factors such as age, gender, health history, amount of sexual partners, and sexual orientation. Doctors can assess an individual’s personal risk factors and determine the most appropriate testing strategy. Below is a brief overview of common STD screening recommendations: Adults and adolescents: Everyone from ages 13 to 64 should be tested for HIV at least once or more as needed based on risk level.
Sexually active women: All sexually active women under 25 years old should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia at least every year. This recommendation also applies to women 25 years and older at an increased risk of STDs due to new or multiple sexual partners, or a partner who has been diagnosed with an STD.
Pregnant women: During a pregnancy, women should be tested for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B. Pregnant women with additional risk factors should also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Sexually active gay and bisexual men: Men in this group should be tested at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Men with multiple or anonymous partners should be tested more frequently, such as every 3 or 6 months. This group may also benefit from more frequent HIV testing.
Unsafe sex and injectable drug users: Anyone who shares injection drug equipment or has sex without protection such as a condom should be tested for HIV at least once a year. Getting test results
Patients may receive results of STD tests during a follow-up appointment with their doctor, over the phone, or though online medical charts. It’s important to discuss STD test results with a healthcare professional who can help you manage your risk for STDs and answer your questions about test results.
If STD test results are positive, it’s important to begin treatment as early as possible in order to reduce the chance of health complications.Your doctor can help you make a plan for sharing your results with sexual partners who may be infected and can discuss retesting that may be necessary after treatment is completed."

Pericardial membranes produce pericardial fluid, a liquid that sits between the pericardium's membranes. The fluid acts as a lubricant for the movement of the heart, reducing friction as the heart pumps blood.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) and/or excessive accumulation of pericardial fluid (pericardial effusion). Pericardial fluid analysis is a group of tests that evaluate this liquid to help diagnose the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons for fluid accumulation in the pericardial space are: An imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels—which drives fluid out of blood vessels—and the amount of protein in blood—which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure or cirrhosis.
An injury or inflammation of the pericardium, in which case the fluid that accumulates is called an exudate. Conditions such as infections, malignancies (metastatic cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma), or autoimmune disease may cause the accumulation of exudate. Determining if the increased fluid is transudate or exudate is important because it helps narrow down the possible causes of pericardial fluid buildup. Healthcare practitioners and laboratorians use an initial set of tests, including cell count, protein or albumin level, and appearance of the fluid, to distinguish between transudates and exudates. Once the fluid is determined to be one or the other, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing pericarditis and/or pericardial effusion."

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are procedures used to collect and evaluate bone marrow cells and structure.
Bone marrow has a honeycomb or sponge-like structure, consisting of a fibrous network that is filled with liquid. The liquid portion contains blood (hematopoetic) stem cells, blood cells in various stages of maturation, and ""raw materials"" such as iron, vitamin B12, and folate that are required for cell production.
The primary function of the bone marrow is to produce red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and white blood cells (WBCs). The number and type of cell being produced at any one time is based on your body's needs (for example, if you are fighting an infection, or to keep up with blood loss) as well as a normal, continual replacement of old cells.
Red Blood Cells (RBCs)
Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, transport oxygen throughout the body. RBCs typically make up about 40-45% of the blood volume and usually survive in circulation for about 120 days. The marrow produces RBCs at a rate that replaces old RBCs that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding, striving to maintain a relatively constant number of RBCs in the blood.
White Blood Cells (WBCs)
There are five different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. Each plays a different role in protecting the body from infection.
Platelets
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are cytoplasmic fragments of very big cells seen in bone marrow called megakaryocytes and are essential for normal blood clotting.
In the bone marrow, a stem cell undergoes development and differentiation to become one of these different types of blood cells. Those that differentiate into lymphoid cells subsequently develop into lymphocytes. Other precursors further develop and differentiate into granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), monocytes, platelets, or red blood cells (erythrocytes).
The cells are released from the bone marrow into circulation when they are fully mature or near full maturity. Thus, the population of cells within bone marrow will typically include cells in various stages of development, from very immature to almost fully mature.
Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy as ""tests"" include both the collection of marrow samples and the evaluation of the cells and structure under the microscope. Bone marrow samples can also be sent as needed for various other tests like flow cytometry immunophenotyping, chromosome analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular testing, or microbiology testing (culture). A specialist who has expertise in the diagnosis of blood-related disorders performs the examination and evaluation of bone marrow samples.
Bone Marrow Aspiration
A bone marrow aspiration collects a sample of the fluid that contains cells so that they can be examined under a microscope and/or evaluated with other tests. A specialist microscopically examines slides of stained smears of the fluid from an aspiration. The cells are evaluated according to number, type, maturity, appearance, etc. and compared to those in the blood using results from a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear. This examination determines, for example: The M/E ratio—this is short for myeloid/erythroid ratio. This calculation compares the number of myeloid cells (WBC precursors) to erythroid cells (RBC precursors).
Differential—determines whether cells in each lineage (WBC, RBC, platelet-producing cells) show orderly and complete maturation, and whether the cells are present in normal proportion to one another.
Presence of any abnormal cells, such as leukemic or tumor cells Bone Marrow Biopsy
A biopsy collects a cylindrical core sample that preserves the marrow's structure. The biopsy sample is evaluated by a specialist to determine: Cellularity—the volume of cells is compared to the volume of other components of the bone marrow, such as fat (and whether cellularity is normal for age, increased, or decreased)
Whether the different cell lineages (myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic) are present in adequate numbers
If there are any abnormal infiltrates in the marrow (cancer, infection) as well as any changes to the bone marrow stroma (fibrosis, for example) or bone itself (osteoporosis) Depending on what condition(s) a healthcare practitioner suspects or is investigating, a number of other tests may be performed on the marrow sample. A few examples include: In the case of leukemia, tests to determine the type of leukemia may be done. These include determination of antigenic markers (for example, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) to provide information on the type of leukemia present, including prognostic or therapeutic markers.
Special stains may also be used to evaluate iron storage in the marrow and to determine whether an abnormal erythroid (RBC) precursor with iron particles surrounding its nucleus (so-called ring sideroblasts) is present.
A chromosome analysis and/or FISH analysis may be ordered to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the case of leukemia, myelodysplasia, lymphoma, or myeloma.
Molecular tests may be performed on a sample of bone marrow to help establish a diagnosis. Examples include:
T-cell receptor gene rearrangement
B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement
JAK2 mutation
BCR-ABL

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/insulin,Insulin,['Fasting Insulin'],"['Insulin, serum']","June 15, 2017.","March 24, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Insulin is a hormone that is produced and stored in the beta cells of the pancreas. It is secreted in response to elevated blood glucose following a meal and is vital for the transportation and storage of glucose, the body's main source of energy. Insulin helps transport glucose from the blood to within cells, thus helping regulate blood glucose levels, and has a role in lipid metabolism. This test measures the amount of insulin in the blood.
Insulin and glucose blood levels must be in balance. After a meal, carbohydrates usually are broken down into glucose and other simple sugars. These are absorbed into the blood, causing the blood glucose level to rise, which in turn stimulates the pancreas to release insulin into the blood. As glucose moves into cells, the level in the blood decreases and release of insulin by the pancreas decreases.
If an individual is not able to produce enough insulin, or if the body's cells are resistant to its effects (insulin resistance), glucose cannot reach most of the body's cells and the cells starve. Meanwhile, blood glucose rises to an unhealthy level. This can cause disturbances in normal metabolic processes that result in various disorders and complications, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and vision and neurological problems.
Diabetes, a disorder associated with high glucose levels and decreased insulin effects, can be a life-threatening condition. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little insulin and so eventually require insulin supplementation therapy. Type 2 diabetes is generally related to insulin resistance, which increases with time.
With insulin resistance, many of the body's cells are unable to respond to the effects of insulin, leaving glucose in the blood. The body compensates by producing additional amounts of the hormone. This results in a high level of insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinemia) and over-stimulation of some tissues that have remained insulin-sensitive. Over time, this process causes an imbalance in the relationship between glucose and insulin and, without treatment, may eventually cause health complications affecting various parts of the body.
In addition to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance may be seen in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), prediabetes or heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acanthosis nigricans, and with disorders related to the pituitary or adrenal glands.
Other than in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia is most often seen in people with tumor of the islet cells in the pancreas (insulinomas) or with an excess amount of administered (exogenous) insulin. Hyperinsulinemia causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can lead to sweating, palpitations, hunger, confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, fainting, and seizures. Since the brain is dependent on blood glucose as an energy source, severe glucose deprivation due to hyperinsulinemia can lead fairly quickly to insulin shock and death."

It regulates the production of acid in the body of the stomach during the digestive process. This test measures the amount of gastrin in the blood to help evaluate an individual with recurrent peptic ulcers and/or other serious abdominal symptoms.
When food is eaten, the antrum of the stomach becomes distended and the presence of food stimulates the release of gastrin. Gastrin in turn stimulates parietal cells to produce gastric acid. Acidity helps to digest food and the rise in acidity eventually suppresses gastrin release. This feedback system normally results in low concentrations of gastrin in the blood, especially in the fasting state. Rare conditions such as G-cell hyperplasia and gastrinomas, including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome, can cause an overproduction of gastrin and gastric acid. This can lead to aggressive peptic ulcers that can be difficult to treat.
Gastrinomas are gastrin-producing tumors. ZE syndrome is a condition caused by the presence of one or more gastrinomas and is characterized by high gastrin levels, greatly increased gastric acid production, and by peptic ulcers.

This test measures the level of vitamin D in the blood.
Two forms of vitamin D can be measured in the blood, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the major form found in the blood and is the relatively inactive precursor to the active hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Because of its long half-life and higher concentration, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is commonly measured to assess and monitor vitamin D status in individuals.
Vitamin D comes from two sources: endogenous, which is produced in the skin on exposure to sunlight, and exogenous, which is ingested in foods and supplements. The chemical structures of the types of vitamin D are slightly different, and they are named vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol, which comes from plants) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, which comes from animals). The D2 form is found in fortified foods and in most vitamin preparations and supplements. Vitamin D3 is the form produced in the body and is also used in some supplements. Vitamin D2 and D3 are equally effective when they are converted by the liver and the kidney into the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
Some tests do not distinguish D2 and D3 forms of the vitamin and report only the total result. Newer methods, however, may report levels of both D2 and D3 and then add them together for a total level.
The main role of vitamin D is to help regulate blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and (to a lesser extent) magnesium. Vitamin D is vital for the growth and health of bone; without it, bones will be soft, malformed, and unable to repair themselves normally, resulting in diseases called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D has also been shown to influence the growth and differentiation of many other tissues and to help regulate the immune system. These other functions have implicated vitamin D in other disorders, such as autoimmunity and cancer.
Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that two-thirds of U.S. population has sufficient vitamin D, while roughly one-quarter are at risk of inadequate vitamin D and 8% are at risk of deficiency, as defined by the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) set by the Institute of Medicine.
People at higher risk of deficiency include the elderly or obese people, people who don't get enough sun exposure, people with darker skin, and people who take certain medications for long periods of time. Adequate sun exposure is typically estimated to be two periods per week of 5-20 minutes. People who do not have adequate sun exposure may obtain the vitamin D that they need from food sources or supplements."

It is a rare cause of hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). This test detects the FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene sequence to help diagnose these conditions.
While some genetic abnormalities are inherited from our parents, they can also come from changes that occur to genes or chromosomes later in life. These are called somatic mutations, which can occur through exposure to various environmental factors (e.g., radiation, certain chemicals), but more often for unknown reasons.
The FIP1LI-PDGFRA gene sequence is one of those genetic changes acquired later in life. It occurs when the chromosome 4 loses approximately 800 nucleotides (DNA building blocks), which normally separate the FIP1L1 and PDGFRA genes. Because of this deletion, the two genes are brought together (fused), producing a new fusion gene. Other types of mutations can also lead to abnormalities of the PDGFRA gene, but this deletion is the most common.
Normally, the PDGFRA gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls processes like cell growth and division. When the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is present, the gene sequence still provides instructions for making that protein, but the protein that results is abnormal because it is always activated and continues to send signals for growth and division. With constant signals for growth, eosinophils (and sometimes other blood cells) can grow out of control, causing hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which can be fatal if not treated promptly.
Hypereosinophilia (HE) and Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)
Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in allergic reactions and immune responses to certain parasites. The number of eosinophils in the blood may be elevated with these conditions. Hypereosinophilia is the prolonged overproduction of eosinophils. As increasing numbers of eosinophils move into and inflame tissues, HES develops. HES results when these eosinophils affect and damage a variety of organs, including the heart, lungs and the nervous system.
Common symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath if the heart is involved. People with HES may also have anemia or excessive clotting (hypercoaguability), stroke, blurred vision or slurred speech. Other symptoms may involve the digestive tract or the skin. Sometimes, there may be no symptoms, when tissue or organ damage is less severe.
There are several causes of HE and HES besides genetic abnormalities. Allergic diseases are the most common cause in the developed world. Parasitic diseases, certain cancers, autoimmune disorders, skin disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and Addison disease can also cause HES. If an individual has HES and a healthcare practitioner has ruled out these secondary (reactive) causes, genetic testing can determine if FIP1L1-PDGFRA or other genetic abnormality is the underlying cause. If the genetic abnormality is detected, the HE or HES is neoplastic.
Only 0.4% of people with persistently high numbers of eosinophils carry the FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene. It is most common in individuals between 20 and 50 years old. Although it is a rare cause of HE and HES, it is important to identify it because HE/HES with FIP1L1-PDGFRA can be fatal if not treated. It can be effectively treated with the drug imatinib."

Two types of tests are available to evaluate fibrinogen. A fibrinogen activity test evaluates how well fibrinogen functions in helping to form a blood clot. A fibrinogen antigen test measures the amount of fibrinogen in the blood.
Fibrinogen is produced by the liver and released into the blood along with several other clotting factors (also called coagulation factors). Normally, when a body tissue or blood vessel wall is injured, a process called hemostasis begins to help stop the bleeding by forming a plug at the injury site. Small cellular fragments called platelets clump and stick to the injury site and clotting factors are activated one after the other. This last part is called the coagulation cascade.
As the cascade nears completion, soluble fibrinogen is converted into insoluble fibrin threads. These threads then crosslink together to form a fibrin net that stabilizes at the injury site. The fibrin net adheres to the site of injury along with the platelets to form a stable blood clot. This barrier prevents additional blood loss and remains in place until the injured area is healed.
For a stable clot to form, there must be enough normally functioning platelets and coagulation factors. Too little, too much, or dysfunctional clotting factors or platelets can lead to bleeding episodes and/or to the formation of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombosis). Several laboratory tests, including fibrinogen tests, can be used to evaluate the clotting process. Fibrinogen testing includes: A fibrinogen activity test evaluates that part of the clotting process in which soluble fibrinogen is converted into fibrin threads. It measures the time that it takes for a fibrin clot to form after a standard amount of thrombin is added to your blood sample (plasma). The time it takes for a clot to form directly correlates with the amount of active fibrinogen that is present. Prolonged clot-formation times may be due to decreased levels of normal fibrinogen or may be due to fibrinogen that does not function as it should (dysfunctional).
A fibrinogen antigen test measures the level of fibrinogen in a blood sample, including both functional and dysfunctional fibrinogen. Fibrinogen is also one of several blood factors that are called acute phase reactants. Blood levels of fibrinogen along with other acute phase reactants rise sharply with conditions causing acute tissue inflammation or damage. Tests for these acute phase reactants, including fibrinogen, may be performed to determine the extent of inflammation in the body."

Excess fecal fat (termed steatorrhea) may be an indication that your digestive system is not working properly and/or that you have a condition affecting the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients (malabsorption).
The body digests foods in stages: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are broken down, in the stomach by acid and enzymes and in the small intestines by enzymes produced by the pancreas and bile from the liver, into their component parts. They are then absorbed, primarily in the small intestines. Finally, the nutrients are transported throughout the body and used or stored. If there are not enough pancreatic enzymes or bile available, then fat and other foods cannot be properly digested and cannot be efficiently absorbed. If a condition prevents the intestines from absorbing nutrients, then they are eliminated in the stool. In both cases – improper digestion or absorption – you can experience symptoms associated with malabsorption and, in severe cases, symptoms of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency. If the condition prevents you from digesting and absorbing fats from the diet, then excess fat is present in the stool and you may experience persistent diarrhea with stools that are loose and foul-smelling (steatorrhea). Fat in stool may be detected with the qualitative fecal fat test, which generally determines the presence or absence of excess fat. This test is performed by placing a suspension of treated or untreated stool onto a glass slide, adding a fat stain, and observing the number and size of fat globules that are present. It should be performed by an experienced professional.
Quantitative measurements of fecal fat, though somewhat more accurate, are less commonly performed. However, they are considered the gold standard. They require a timed stool collection and a dietary sheet to help calculate the total fat intake during the collection period, usually a 72-hour stool collection. Results are reported as the amount of fat eliminated in stool per day (24 hours).
Another quantitative test is called the acid steatocrit, which provides a rapid but less exact measure of the amount of fat in the stool. It is a less complicated test that can be used on a random stool sample."

B2M is frequently elevated in the blood with cancers such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma and with inflammatory disorders and infections (e.g., HIV, CMV). Because B2M is increased with blood cell cancers, it may be useful as a tumor marker. Though it can be used to assess kidney function, this article focuses on its use as a tumor marker.

Tau is a structural protein in the brain. Tau protein containing many phosphorus groups (P-tau) can produce neurofibrillary tangles, which are twisted protein fragments that develop in nerve cells and disrupt the cells' ability to transport signals. Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are considered to be the main diagnostic features of Alzheimer disease.

This test measures FSH in the blood.
FSH is made by the pituitary gland, a small organ located in the center of the head behind the sinus cavity at the base of the brain. Control of FSH production is a complex system involving the hypothalamus in the brain, the pituitary gland, and the hormones produced by the ovaries or testicles. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary to release FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), a closely related hormone also involved in reproduction. In women of childbearing age, FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of eggs (follicles) in the ovaries during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is divided into the follicular and the luteal phases, with each phase lasting about 14 days. During this follicular phase, FSH initiates the production of estradiol by the follicle, and the two hormones work together in the further development of the egg follicle. Near the end of the follicular phase, there is a surge of FSH and luteinizing hormone. Release of the egg from the ovary (ovulation) occurs shortly after this surge of hormones. The hormone inhibin as well as estradiol and progesterone help control the amount of FSH released by the pituitary gland. FSH also facilitates the ability of the ovary to respond to LH. 	As a woman ages and menopause approaches, ovarian function wanes and eventually ceases. As this occurs, FSH and LH levels rise. In men, FSH stimulates the testicles to produce mature sperm and also promotes the production of androgen binding proteins. FSH levels are relatively constant in men after puberty. Less is known about FSH levels in aging men.
In infants and children, FSH levels rise shortly after birth and then fall to very low levels by 6 months in boys and 1-2 years in girls. Concentrations begin to rise again before the beginning of puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Disorders affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, and/or the ovaries or testicles can cause the production of too much or too little FSH, resulting in a variety of conditions such as infertility, abnormal menstrual cycles, or early (precocious) or delayed puberty."

The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamine testing measures the amounts of these hormones in the urine and/or blood. Urine testing is recommended over blood testing. Just the stress of having blood drawn can increase catecholamine blood levels, so results from blood tests are not as reliable as results from urine tests.
Catecholamines are produced in the adrenal medulla, the interior portion of the adrenal glands, and released into the blood. The adrenal glands are small, triangular organs located on top of each kidney. Catecholamines are also produced by cells of the sympathetic nervous system. They are released into the blood in response to physical and emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, causing increased blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and metabolism.
After completing their actions, catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Dopamine becomes homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine breaks down into normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and epinephrine becomes metanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Normally, catecholamines and their metabolites are present in the body in small, fluctuating amounts that only increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation. However, rare tumors called pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (collectively called PPGL) can produce large amounts of the hormones, resulting in increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. This can cause persistent or sudden bursts of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include heart palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and symptoms may worsen. Over time, the hypertension caused by the excess hormones may lead to kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk for stroke or heart attack.
It is important to diagnose and treat these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to significantly reduce the amount of catecholamines being produced and to reduce or eliminate their associated symptoms and complications."

This test detects and measures AChR antibodies in the blood.
Muscle movement starts when an impulse is sent down a nerve to the nerve ending, where it stimulates the release of acetylcholine, a chemical substance (neurotransmitter) that transmits messages between specific types of cells. Acetylcholine travels across the very small gap between the nerve ending and a muscle fiber (this gap is called the ""neuromuscular junction""). When acetylcholine reaches the muscle fiber, it binds to one of many acetylcholine receptors or ""docking stations"" and activates it, initiating muscle contraction.
AChR antibodies impede communication between nerves and skeletal muscles, inhibit muscle contraction, and cause rapid muscle fatigue by preventing activation of the acetylcholine receptors. They do this in three major ways: Binding antibodies attach to the receptors on nerve cells and may initiate an inflammatory reaction that destroys the receptors.
Blocking antibodies may sit on the receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding.
Modulating antibodies may cross-link the receptors, causing them to be taken up into the muscle cell and removed from the neuromuscular junction. The end result of this interference is the development of myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic autoimmune disorder associated with the presence of these antibodies and with their effects on muscle control.
AChR antibodies may be detected in different ways to determine which mechanism may be the problem, and the antibodies may be referred to as ""binding,"" ""blocking,"" or ""modulating."" However, the technique that measures ""binding"" is the most commonly performed and, generally speaking, it is rare for the other two tests to be positive without the ""binding"" test being positive as well. These other two tests may be useful when a healthcare practitioner strongly suspects myasthenia gravis and the ""binding"" test is negative."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/lithium,Lithium,[],[],"November 3, 2020.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Lithium is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antipsychotic for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Occasionally, it can be used in other disorders in combination with an antidepressant that does not adequately treat a depression. This test measures the amount of lithium in the blood.
Bipolar disorder can affect both adults and children. It is a mental condition marked by alternating periods of depression and mania. These periods may be as short as a few days or weeks or as long as months or years. During an episode of depression, you may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and lose interest in daily activities. You may be fatigued but have trouble sleeping, experience weight loss or gain, have difficulty concentrating, and have thoughts of suicide.
During a manic episode, you may be euphoric, irritable, have high energy and grandiose ideas, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Sometimes you will have mixed episodes with aspects of both mania and depression. Lithium is prescribed to stabilize the mood swings of bipolar disorder. It is often called a ""mood stabilizer"" and is sometimes prescribed for people with depression who are not responding well to other medications. Less commonly, lithium may be prescribed to prevent disorders with symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and cluster headaches.
Because lithium is a relatively slow-acting drug, its effect on mood may take several weeks. Dosages of the drug are adjusted up or down until blood levels are within a therapeutic range—the blood level range that achieves the desired effect and treats your bipolar disorder. The actual amount of drug that it will take to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may be affected by your age, general state of health, and other medications that you are taking.
Lithium levels are monitored on a regular basis because lithium has a narrow therapeutic index. This means there is relatively little space between therapeutic and toxic levels. Too little drug, and the medication will not be effective. Too much drug and symptoms of lithium toxicity may develop."

The test may be used to measure blood levels every few days when you first begin taking lithium to help adjust the dose and reach the desired blood level and may also be used at regular intervals or as needed to monitor blood levels. If you start taking additional medications, your healthcare practitioner may order one or more lithium tests to judge the other drugs' effect, if any, on lithium levels.

Long-term use of lithium carries a risk of decreased kidney function. People with kidney disease and reduced kidney function may have increased lithium levels because it takes the kidneys longer to clear the drug from the body.

It affects blood glucose levels, helps maintain blood pressure, and helps regulate the immune system. Most cortisol in the blood is bound to a protein; only a small percentage is ""free"" and biologically active. Free cortisol is secreted into the urine and is present in the saliva. This test measures the amount of cortisol in the blood, urine, or saliva.
The level of cortisol in the blood (as well as the urine and saliva) normally rises and falls in a ""diurnal variation"" pattern. It peaks early in the morning, then declines throughout the day, reaching its lowest level about midnight. This pattern can change when a person works irregular shifts (such as the night shift) and sleeps at different times of the day, and it can become disrupted when a disease or condition either limits or stimulates cortisol production.
Cortisol is produced and secreted by the adrenal glands, two triangular organs that sit on top of the kidneys. Production of the hormone is regulated by the hypothalamus in the brain and by the pituitary gland, a tiny organ located below the brain. When the blood cortisol level falls, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which directs the pituitary gland to produce ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol. In order for appropriate amounts of cortisol to be made, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands must be functioning properly.
The group of signs and symptoms that are seen with an abnormally high level of cortisol is called Cushing syndrome. Increased cortisol production may be seen with: Administration of large amounts of glucocorticosteroid hormones (such as prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone) to treat a variety of conditions, such as autoimmune disease and some tumors
ACTH-producing tumors, in the pituitary gland and/or in other parts of the body
Increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands, due to a tumor or due to excessive growth of adrenal tissues (hyperplasia)
Rarely, with tumors in various parts of the body that produce CRH Decreased cortisol production may be seen with: An underactive pituitary gland or a pituitary gland tumor that inhibits ACTH production; this is known as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Underactive or damaged adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency) that limit cortisol production; this is referred to as primary adrenal insufficiency and is also known as Addison disease."

It may be prescribed by itself or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. This test measures the level of carbamazepine in the blood.
Carbamazepine levels are monitored because the drug must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, the drug may not be effective and the person may experience a recurrence of symptoms (i.e., seizures, mania, or pain); if the level is too high, the person may experience toxic side effects. Maintaining a therapeutic level of this drug can be a challenge to achieve for several different reasons: Oral doses of carbamazepine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract at widely variable rates.
Since carbamazepine is metabolized by the liver, anything that affects liver function can affect blood levels of the drug.
Upon a long-term administration, carbamazepine induces its own metabolism.
Much of the drug is bound to plasma protein, but it is the free portion of the drug that is active. Conditions that affect protein binding of the drug may affect therapeutic effectiveness. This may occur when someone has low blood albumin, kidney failure, or when they are very young (newborn) or elderly.
The metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, is also therapeutically active and contributes to the overall effect of the medication.
Several drugs, if taken in conjunction with carbamazepine, may interact or affect its metabolism and blood levels. Dosages of carbamazepine must be adjusted carefully in order to reach a steady concentration in the blood. The actual amount of drug required to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may change over time.
Carbamazepine is usually monitored long-term because it is prescribed to treat the chronic conditions epilepsy, bipolar disorder, trigeminal neuralgia, and nerve pain from diabetes.
Epilepsy affects the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, a person may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to occasional seizures, to recurrent seizures. Carbamazepine is prescribed to help prevent specific types of recurrent seizures.
Bipolar disorder is a mental condition that is characterized by cycles of depression and mania that may last for days, weeks, months, or years. During a depressive episode, those affected may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and have thoughts of suicide. During a manic episode, those affected may be euphoric, irritable, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Carbamazepine is prescribed to help even out the moods of the person with bipolar disorder, especially mania.
Trigeminal neuralgia, a condition associated with facial nerve pain and muscle spasms, and paroxysmal choreoathetosis, a movement disorder that causes involuntary movements of the limbs, trunk, and facial muscles, are also sometimes treated with carbamazepine. So is diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, which affects the functionality, mood, and sleep patterns of approximately 10-20% of people with diabetes mellitus.

RSV testing detects the presence of respiratory syncytial virus in nasal secretions to help diagnose the infection.
Most people recover from an RSV infection without any specific treatment or having to see a healthcare practitioner to get tested. However, testing may be done for infants, young children with heart or lung problems, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems because they are particularly vulnerable. In these high-risk groups, RSV can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the small airways of the lungs.
Signs and symptoms of RSV infection are similar to those of other respiratory infections and usually appear 4 to 6 days after someone comes into contact with the virus. Signs and symptoms may include: Runny nose
Coughing, sneezing
Reduced appetite
Fever
Wheezing
In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, sluggishness (inactivity), and difficulty breathing According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost everyone has been infected with RSV by the time they are 2 years old. It is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children in the U.S. and globally.
Though usually causing a mild illness, RSV can be serious in some children and adults. Each year in the U.S., RSV leads to about: 2.1 million outpatient visits and 57,000 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old
177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among adults older than 65 years The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally there may be as many as 30 million RSV lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years old, resulting in than 3.4 million hospitalizations each year.

Sometimes, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab is used, although it is not preferred because the amount of virus obtained on a swab is usually low. The NP swab is collected by having a person tip his or her head back, then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip) is gently inserted into one of the nostrils until resistance is met (about 1 to 2 inches in), then rotated several times and withdrawn.

In recent years, scientists have been able to gain information about tumors by analyzing these cells or DNA or RNA that circulate in the blood. These techniques require blood samples rather than the tumor tissue samples required by traditional biopsies, so they are often called liquid biopsies.
Tissue biopsies are the standard of care for cancer diagnosis. However, removing cancer tissue through surgery, or in some cases a needle biopsy, is an invasive process. In addition, the difficulty reaching a tumor can limit the ability of healthcare practitioners to sample it. However, the genetic information in tumor cells and tumor DNA or RNA may provide important information about the tumor, such as the likelihood of response to treatment, of relapse after treatment, or how the tumor is responding to cancer therapy. This has led to the emergence of liquid biopsy as a promising, non-invasive, complement to tissue biopsy.
By requiring a blood draw rather than a tissue biopsy, liquid biopsies can be more tolerable than traditional biopsies and may be acceptable for more frequent sampling to monitor cancer. As cancer treatments become more targeted to the genetic makeup of a tumor, liquid biopsies are a minimally-invasive way to understand how a tumor's genetic make-up is evolving during treatment.
Currently, there are two main approaches to liquid biopsy: Circulating tumor cell (CTC) tests, which look at whole tumor cells in the blood
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests, which look for the DNA that tumor cells release into the blood Other techniques, such as looking at cell fragments called extracellular vesicles (exosomes) or small molecules of non-coding RNA (microRNAs), are being studied.
In addition to applications such as cancer detection and treatment, liquid biopsies may also provide promise for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and early detection. Currently, the medical applications of liquid biopsies are limited to determining prognosis in breast, colon, and prostate cancer, guiding treatment in those cancers, and guiding treatment of non-small cell lung cancer."

A reticulocyte count helps to determine the number and/or percentage of reticulocytes in the blood and is a reflection of recent bone marrow function or activity.
Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, where blood-forming (hematopoietic) stem cells differentiate and develop, eventually forming reticulocytes and finally becoming mature RBCs. Reticulocytes are visually, slightly larger than mature RBCs. Unlike most other cells in the body, mature RBCs have no nucleus, but reticulocytes still have some remnant genetic material (RNA). As reticulocytes mature, they lose the last residual RNA and most are fully developed within one day of being released from the bone marrow into the blood. The reticulocyte count or percentage is a good indicator of the ability of a person's bone marrow to adequately produce red blood cells (erythropoiesis).
RBCs typically survive for about 120 days in circulation, and the bone marrow is continually producing new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. Normally, a stable number of RBCs is maintained in the blood through continual replacement of degraded or lost RBCs.
A variety of diseases and conditions can affect the production of new RBCs and/or their survival, in addition to those conditions that may result in significant bleeding. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the number of RBCs and may affect the reticulocyte count.
Higher than normal percentage of reticulocytes: Acute or chronic bleeding (hemorrhage) or increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) can lead to fewer RBCs in the blood, resulting in anemia. The body compensates for this loss or to treatment of deficiency anemias (such as iron deficiency anemia or pernicious anemia) by increasing the rate of RBC production and by releasing RBCs sooner into the blood, before they become more mature. When this happens, the number and percentage of reticulocytes in the blood increases until a sufficient number of RBCs replaces those that were lost or until the production capacity of the bone marrow is reached.
Lower than normal percentage of reticulocytes: Decreased RBC production may occur when the bone marrow is not functioning normally. This can result from a bone marrow disorder such as aplastic anemia. Diminished production can also be due to other factors, for example, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney disease, radiation or chemotherapy treatments for cancer, a low level of the hormone erythropoietin, or deficiencies in certain nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12 or folate. Decreased production leads to fewer RBCs in circulation, decreased hemoglobin and oxygen-carrying capacity, a lower hematocrit, and a reduced number of reticulocytes as old RBCs are removed from the blood but not fully replaced.
Occasionally, both the reticulocyte count and the RBC count will be increased because of excess RBC production by the bone marrow. This may be due to an increased production of erythropoietin, disorders that cause chronic overproduction of RBCs (polycythemia vera), and cigarette smoking.
Some drugs may increase or decrease reticulocyte counts."

This test detects and measures antibodies that may be produced by your immune system when or after you are treated with heparin.
Heparin is a common anticoagulant that is given intravenously or through injections to prevent the formation of inappropriate blood clots (thrombosis) or as an initial treatment when you have a blood clot, to prevent the clot from enlarging. It is often given during some surgeries, such as heart surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass), when the risk for developing blood clots is high. Small amounts of heparin are frequently used to flush out catheters and intravenous lines to keep clots from forming in them.
Sometimes, when you are given heparin, the drug can combine with a substance found in platelets called platelet factor 4 (PF4) and form a complex. In some people, the body's immune system recognizes the heparin-PF4 complex as ""foreign"" and produces an antibody directed against it. This antibody in turn can activate your platelets and lead to a drop in the number of platelets, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It may also lead to the development of new thrombosis or worsening thrombosis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin use.
Platelets are cell fragments that are an important part of your blood clotting system. When a blood vessel is injured and leaks blood, platelets are activated and clump together at the site of the injury, and work with coagulation factors to promote clot formation and stop the bleeding.
Not everyone on heparin produces HIT antibodies, and not everyone with HIT antibodies develops a low platelet count, but about 1% to 5% of those with the antibodies do. In HIT, the antibodies bind to the heparin-PF4 complexes, which then attach to the surface of platelets. If this happens, it activates your platelets, which in turn, triggers the release of more PF4.
This starts a cycle that can cause a rapid and significant drop (e.g., 50% or more) in the number of platelets in your blood.
Usually, a decrease in platelets results in a higher risk of bleeding, but in HIT, the activation of platelets by HIT antibodies can paradoxically lead to new and progressive blood clot formation in your veins and arteries.
This cycle occurs in about 30% to 50% of those who develop the HIT antibody and thrombocytopenia. This condition, associated with the presence of HIT antibody, low platelet count, and excessive clotting, is formally called immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or HIT type II. If this happens, it typically develops about 5-10 days after you start heparin therapy but may also develop rapidly, within 1-2 days, if you have been treated with heparin in the last 3 months and start heparin treatment again.
There is also a non-immune mediated HIT (type I) that occurs when heparin binds directly to platelets, causing activation. It is more common than type II but is temporary and a milder form and is of no clinical significance."

It also works with the other electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride) to maintain electrical neutrality at the cellular level. This test measures the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood, which occurs mostly in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3-). The CO2 is mainly a by-product of various metabolic processes.
Measuring bicarbonate as part of an electrolyte or metabolic panel may help diagnose an electrolyte imbalance or acidosis or alkalosis. Acidosis and alkalosis describe the abnormal conditions that result from an imbalance in the pH of the blood caused by an excess of acid or alkali (base). This imbalance is typically caused by some underlying condition or disease.
The lungs and kidneys are the major organs involved in regulating blood pH through the removal of excess bicarbonate. The lungs flush acid out of the body by exhaling CO2. Raising and lowering the respiratory rate alters the amount of CO2 that is breathed out, and this can affect blood pH within minutes.
The kidneys eliminate acids in the urine and they regulate the concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-, a base) in blood. Acid-base changes due to increases or decreases in HCO3- concentration occur more slowly than changes in CO2, taking hours or days. Any disease or condition that affects the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing has the potential to cause acidosis or alkalosis.
The bicarbonate test gives a healthcare practitioner a rough estimate of your acid-base balance. This is usually sufficient, but measurements of gases dissolved in the blood (blood gases) may be done if more information is needed. Bicarbonate is typically measured along with sodium, potassium, and possibly chloride in an electrolyte panel as it is the balance of these molecules that gives the healthcare practitioner the most information."

This test detects and measures anti-CCP antibodies in the blood.
Citrulline is naturally produced in the body as part of the metabolism of the amino acid arginine. However, in joints with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this conversion may occur at a higher rate. Citrulline changes the protein structure and can trigger an immune response, producing autoantibodies against joint proteins. The CCP antibody test helps to diagnose RA and can be useful in identifying people with a more rapidly erosive form of the disease.
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, pain, stiffness, and destructive changes in the hands, feet, and other joints throughout the body. It can affect anyone at any age, but it usually develops between the ages of 40 and 60, and about 75% of those affected are women. The course of RA and its prognosis are variable. It may develop and progress slowly or rapidly. It may go into remission in some people and, in a few, it may go away. Left untreated, RA can shorten a person's lifespan and can, within a few years, leave many of those affected too disabled to work.
There are a variety of treatments available to minimize the complications of RA, but they depend on making an accurate diagnosis and on beginning treatment before the development of irreversible joint damage. Rheumatoid factor (RF) has been the primary blood test used to detect RA and distinguish it from other types of arthritis and other inflammatory processes. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RF are not ideal; it can be negative in people who have clinical signs of RA and positive in people who do not. Studies have shown that the CCP antibody test has a similar sensitivity to RF but a much higher specificity (95-98%) and is more likely to be positive with early RA.
The 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) includes CCP antibody testing, along with RF, as part of its criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. According to the ACR, CCP antibodies may be detected in about 50-60% of people with early RA, as early as 3-6 months after the beginning of symptoms. Early detection and diagnosis of RA allows healthcare providers to begin aggressive treatment of the condition, minimizing the associated complications and tissue damage."

For instance, the FDA-approved direct-to-consumer test detects only 3 out of the more than 1000 mutations known to occur in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This limitation means that, even if your test results are negative, you could still have one of the many BRCA mutations that weren’t tested for.

MRSA testing detects the presence of MRSA in a patient's sample.
Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes the human skin and is present in the nose of about a third of U.S. adults. It does not usually cause illness or symptoms. However, if there is a break in someone's skin from a wound or surgery, or if someone's immune system is weakened, then colonizing S. aureus can cause an infection.
Widespread use of antibiotics over the past several decades have led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus. Infection with these strains can cause skin infections and potentially more severe, life-threatening infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (septicemia), or infections at a surgical site. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than 2% of the population carries the type of staph bacteria known as MRSA. [For more on this, see the article Staph Infections and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.]
MRSA can be spread in healthcare settings and in the community. Contaminated hands, medical equipment, and surfaces in places such as hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes allow the spread of MRSA from colonized or infected patients. In the community, anything that allows for skin-to-skin contact can spread MRSA. This includes sharing personal care items, participating in contact sports, or living or working in close contact with others.
Most hospitals have instituted measures to attempt to eradicate MRSA and to control the spread of MRSA from person to person. Those who test positive for MRSA may be isolated to prevent the spread to others and/or decolonized with a nasal antibiotic ointment and daily cleansing with special antimicrobial wipes. However, exactly how to implement MRSA screening and control in healthcare settings remains somewhat controversial. For example, a 2014 study comparing prevention strategies for bloodstream infections found that treating to eliminate MRSA from intensive care unit (ICU) patients who screen positive was not as effective at reducing these infections as treating all patients admitted to the ICU. This treatment may involve administering antibiotics within the nose and cleansing patients with special antimicrobial wipes. As a result, hospital policies may change in the future and less MRSA screening may be performed in these settings."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/cystatin-c,Cystatin C,[],[],"May 4, 2017.","March 25, 2021.",What is being tested?,"Cystatin C is a relatively small protein that is produced throughout the body by all cells that contain a nucleus and is found in a variety of body fluids, including the blood. It is produced, filtered from the blood by the kidneys, and broken down at a constant rate. This test measures the amount of cystatin C in blood to help evaluate kidney function.
Cystatin C is filtered out of the blood by the glomeruli, clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that allow water, dissolved substances, and wastes to pass through their walls while retaining blood cells and larger proteins. What passes through the walls of the glomeruli forms a filtrate fluid. From this fluid, the kidneys reabsorb cystatin C, glucose, and other substances. The remaining fluid and wastes are carried to the bladder and excreted as urine. The reabsorbed cystatin C is then broken down and is not returned to the blood.
The rate at which the fluid is filtered is called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A decline in kidney function leads to decreases in the GFR and to increases in cystatin C and other measures of kidney function, such as creatinine and urea in the blood. The increases in these levels occur because the kidneys are not able to properly filter the blood at a normal rate, causing their accumulation in the blood. On the other hand, improvement in kidney function is expected to lead to increases in GFR, which would cause cystatin C, creatinine, and urea to decline as a result of the kidneys being able to effectively clear them from the blood.
When the kidneys are functioning normally, concentrations of cystatin C in the blood are stable. However, as kidney function deteriorates, the concentrations begin to rise. This increase in cystatin C occurs as the GFR falls and is often detectable before there is a measurable decrease in kidney function (GFR).
Because cystatin C levels fluctuate with changes in GFR, there has been interest in the cystatin C test as one method of evaluating kidney function. Tests currently used include creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism that is measured in the blood and urine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and eGFR (an estimate of the GFR usually calculated from the blood creatinine level). Unlike creatinine, cystatin C is not significantly affected by muscle mass (hence, sex or age), race, or diet, which has led to the idea that it could be a more reliable marker of kidney function and potentially used to generate a more precise estimate of GFR.
While there are growing data and literature supporting the use of cystatin C, there is still a degree of uncertainty about when and how it should be used. However, testing is becoming increasingly more available and steps are being taken toward standardizing the calibration of cystatin C results."

Two major antigens or surface identifiers on human RBCs are the A and B antigens. Another important surface antigen is called Rh. Blood typing detects the presence or absence of these antigens to determine a person's ABO blood group and Rh type.
People whose red blood cells have A antigens are in blood group A, those with B antigens are group B, those with both A and B antigens are in group AB, and those who do not have either of these markers are in blood group O.
If the Rh protein is present on the red blood cells, a person's blood type is Rh+ (positive); if it is absent, the person's blood is type Rh- (negative).
Our bodies naturally produce antibodies against the A and B antigens that we do not have on our red blood cells. For example, a person who is blood type A will have anti-B antibodies directed against the B antigens on red blood cells and someone who is type B will have anti-A antibodies directed against the A antigens. People with type AB blood have neither of these antibodies, while those with type O blood have both.
The following table indicates the type of antibodies a person is expected to have based on their blood type.  a person with blood type ...

A
B antigen
B
A antigen
AB
Neither antigen
O
A and B antigens  These antibodies are useful for determining a person's blood type and help determine the types of blood that he or she can safely receive (compatibility). If a person who is group A with antibodies directed against the B antigen, for example, were to be transfused with blood that is type B, his or her own antibodies would target and destroy the transfused red blood cells, causing severe, potentially fatal complications. Thus, it is critical to match a person's blood type with the blood that is to be transfused.
Unlike antibodies to A and B antigens, antibodies to Rh are not produced naturally. That is, Rh antibodies develop only after a person who does not have Rh factor on his or her red blood cells (Rh negative) is exposed to Rh positive red blood cells. This can happen during pregnancy or birth when an Rh-negative woman is pregnant with an Rh-positive baby, or sometimes when an Rh-negative person is transfused with Rh-positive blood. In either case, the first exposure to the Rh antigen may not result in a strong response against the Rh positive cells, but subsequent exposures may cause severe reactions."

It is found in all cells, including red blood cells (RBCs) and helps protect them from certain toxic by-products of cellular metabolism. A deficiency in G6PD causes RBCs to become more vulnerable to breaking apart (hemolysis) under certain conditions. This test measures the amount of G6PD in RBCs to help diagnose a deficiency.
G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder. When individuals who have inherited this condition are exposed to a trigger such as stress, an infection, certain drugs or other substance(s), significant changes occur in the structure of the outer layer (cell membrane) of their red blood cells. Hemoglobin, the life-sustaining, oxygen-transporting protein within RBCs, forms deposits (precipitates) called Heinz bodies. Some individuals may experience these reactions when exposed to fava beans, a condition called ""favism."" With these changes, RBCs can break apart more readily, causing a decrease in the number of RBCs. When the body cannot produce sufficient RBCs to replace those destroyed, hemolytic anemia results and the individual may develop jaundice, weakness, fatigue, and/or shortness of breath.
G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in the world, affecting more than 400 million people. It may be seen in up to 10% of African-American males and 20% of African males. It is also commonly found in people from the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia.
G6PD deficiency is inherited, passed from parent to child, due to mutations or changes in the G6PD gene that cause decreased enzyme activity. There are over 440 variants of G6PD deficiency. The G6PD gene is located on the sex-linked X chromosome. Since men have one X and one Y sex chromosome, their single X chromosome carries the G6PD gene. This may result in a G6PD deficiency if a male inherits the single X chromosome with an altered gene.
Since women have two X sex chromosomes, they inherit two copies of the G6PD gene. Women with only one mutated gene (heterozygous) produce enough G6PD that they usually do not experience any symptoms (i.e., asymptomatic), but under situations of stress, they may demonstrate a mild form of the deficiency. In addition, a mother may pass the single mutated gene to any male children. Rarely do women have two mutated gene copies (homozygous), which could result in G6PD deficiency.
G6PD deficiency is a common cause of persistent jaundice in newborns. If left untreated, this can lead to significant brain damage and mental retardation.
Most people with G6PD deficiency can lead fairly normal lives, but there is no specific treatment apart from prevention. They must be cautious and avoid certain medications such as aspirin, phenazopyridine and rasburicase, antibiotics with ""sulf"" in the name and dapsone, anti-malarial drugs with ""quine"" in the name, foods such as fava beans, and chemical substances such as naphthalene (found in moth balls). Note that fava beans, often called broad beans, are commonly grown in the Mediterranean area. Acute viral and bacterial infections can also initiate episodes of hemolytic anemia as well as elevated levels of acid in the blood (i.e., acidosis). Individuals should consult with their healthcare practitioner to get a comprehensive list of these triggers. A good starting point is the list found on the G6PD Deficiency Favism Association website.
With hemolytic anemia, RBCs are destroyed at an accelerated rate and the person affected becomes pale and fatigued (anemic) as their capacity for providing oxygen to their body decreases. In severe cases of RBC destruction, jaundice can also be present. Most of these episodes are self-limiting, but if a large number of RBCs are destroyed and the body cannot replace them fast enough, then the affected person may require a blood transfusion. This condition can be fatal if not treated. A small percentage of those affected with G6PD deficiency may experience chronic anemia."

A test for osmolality measures the amount of dissolved substances such as sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, and urea in a sample of blood and sometimes in urine. Alternatively, it can be estimated from the major solutes expected to be in the blood or urine.
Water balance in the body is a dynamic process that is regulated by controlling the amount of water eliminated in the urine by the kidneys and by increasing or decreasing water drinking by regulating ""thirst."" In a healthy person, the body perceives and reacts to changes in the amount of water and particles in the blood. When blood osmolality increases with a decrease in the amount of water in the blood or an increase in the number of particles such as sodium, chloride, and glucose, a gland called the hypothalamus releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The kidneys respond to ADH by conserving water and producing urine that is more concentrated. The retained water dilutes the blood and lowers blood osmolality back to normal. This also increases blood volume and blood pressure. If this is not sufficient to restore the water balance, then thirst is also stimulated so that the affected person will drink more water.
When blood osmolality decreases, the release of ADH is suppressed, the kidneys release more dilute urine, the amount of water in the body decreases, thirst is diminished, and blood osmolality increases back toward normal. A blood (serum) osmolality test is primarily a measure of sodium dissolved in the serum (the liquid portion of blood). Sodium is the major electrolyte in the blood and urine. It works with potassium, chloride, and CO2 (in the form of bicarbonate) to maintain electrical neutrality in the body and acid-base balance. Sodium comes into the body in the diet and is normally conserved or eliminated in the urine by the kidneys to maintain its concentration in the blood within a healthy range.
In addition to electrolytes, glucose and urea contribute to osmolality. Normally their contributions are small, but when someone has high blood glucose (hyperglycemia, as found in untreated diabetes) or high blood urea (seen in diseases such as kidney failure), their influence can be significant.
Serum osmolality is often used in cases of suspected poisoning or overdose. Toxins such as methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and acetone, and drugs such as salicylates (aspirin) can also affect osmolality when ingested in sufficiently large amounts.
A urine osmolality test primarily measures the waste products urea and creatinine. Urea and creatinine are produced and removed by the body at a relatively constant rate.
A serum osmolal gap (osmotic gap) may also be calculated. It is the difference between measured and calculated (estimated) osmolality results. In order to calculate the osmolal gap, tests for blood sodium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and glucose must be performed to calculate the expected osmolality. Some versions of the expected osmolality calculation also include the measurement of ethanol. An increase in the osmolal gap (greater than 10) indicates the presence of substances such as toxins, aspirin (salicylates), or mannitol."

They are an important part of the body's immune system and also have a role in inflammation, allergies, and protection against cancer. A WBC differential categorizes the numbers of each of the different types of WBCs in sample of your blood.
There are five main types of white blood cells, each with different functions. The differential shows if: The different types of WBCs are present in normal proportion to one another
The numbers of the different cell types are normal, increased or decreased
Abnormal and/or immature WBCs are present This information is helpful in diagnosing specific types of illnesses that affect the immune system and the bone marrow.
A differential may be performed along with or following a complete blood count (CBC), a test often used as a general health check, or it may be performed in follow-up to abnormal results on a CBC. Most often, a differential is performed on an automated blood analyzer. Occasionally, it is performed manually by a trained laboratory professional who examines a blood smear using a microscope.
Types of White Blood Cells
The bone marrow produces five main types of WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Neutrophils (neu) normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue, where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi.
Lymphocytes (lymphs) exist in both the blood and the lymphatic system. They are broadly divided into three types, but the differential does not distinguish among them. The differential counts and reports all lymphocytes together. Separate specialized testing (like immunophenotyping) must be done to differentiate the three types:
B lymphocytes (B cells) are produce antibodies that help protect against infections. Plasma cells are fully differentiated B-cells that produce antibodies, immune proteins that target and destroy bacteria, viruses and other ""non-self"" foreign antigens.
T lymphocytes (T cells) finish maturing in the thymus and consist of a few different types. Some T cells help the body distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" antigens. Others initiate and control the extent of an immune response, boosting it as needed and then slowing it as the condition resolves. Other types of T cells directly attack and neutralize virus-infected or cancerous cells.
Natural killer cells (NK cells) directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.
Monocytes (mono), similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated more often with long-term (chronic) rather than acute infections. They are also involved in tissue repair and other functions involving the immune system.
Eosinophils (eos) respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation."

Immature granulocytes are white blood cells that have not fully developed before being released from the bone marrow into the blood. They may include metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes. These cells are normally only present in the bone marrow because they are precursors of neutrophils, the predominant type of white cells in blood. The presence of immature granulocytes in the blood may occur in various diseases, such as infection or a blood cancer, and thus will often prompt further investigation, which may include additional laboratory testing."

Heparin is a drug that inhibits blood clotting (anticoagulant) and is usually given through a vein (intravenously, IV), by injection or continuous infusion. High doses of heparin may be given during medical or surgical procedures that require that blood be prevented from clotting, such as heart bypass surgery.
In moderate doses, heparin is used to help prevent and treat inappropriate blood clot formation (thrombosis or thromboembolism) and is monitored using the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or the heparin anti-factor Xa test. Monitoring is a vital part of the anticoagulation therapy because the blood thinning (anticoagulant) effect of heparin can affect each person a little bit differently. If the amount of heparin administered is not enough to inhibit the body's clotting system, blood clots may form in blood vessels throughout the body. If there is too much heparin, excessive, even life-threatening, bleeding can occur.
High doses of heparin are given, for example, before, during, and for a short time after, open heart surgeries. During these operations, the patient's heart and lungs are often bypassed. This means their blood is filtered and oxygenated outside of the body using mechanical devices. The blood's contact with artificial surfaces activates platelets and coagulation, initiating a sequence of steps that results in blood clot formation. A high dose of heparin prevents clot formation but leaves the body in a delicate dynamic balance between clotting and bleeding. At this level of anticoagulation, the PTT is no longer clinically useful as a monitoring tool. The PTT test involves an in vitro clotting reaction and at high levels of heparin, it will not clot. In these cases, the ACT must be used for monitoring."

Conditions that trigger the immune system, such as an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB), may cause increased amounts of ADA to be produced in the areas where the bacteria are present. This test measures the amount of adenosine deaminase present in pleural fluid in order to help diagnose a tuberculosis infection of the pleurae.
Pleurae are membranes that cover the chest cavity and the outside of each lung. Small amounts of pleural fluid are continuously produced to lubricate the movement of the lungs against these membranes and the membranes against each other during inhalation and exhalation. A variety of conditions and diseases, including infection, can cause inflammation of the pleurae (pleurisy or pleuritis) and can lead to excessive pleural fluid accumulation (pleural effusion).
Tuberculosis can spread into the lungs and pleurae, causing symptoms such as chest pain, chronic cough, and shortness of breath. Since these symptoms may also be seen with a variety of other conditions, it is important to determine the cause as rapidly as possible in order to properly treat the affected person. Detecting mycobacteria in pleural fluid can be difficult because there may be a large volume of fluid and very low numbers of bacteria present. Though the ADA test is not specific and does not replace the culture for diagnosing TB, it may be positive even when numbers of bacteria are very low and can be used as an adjunct test to help determine whether tuberculosis is the likely source of a person's symptoms."

This test measures the amount of mycophenolic acid in the blood.
Normally, a healthy immune system distinguishes the body's own healthy tissue (self) from threats such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites (non-self). However, the immune system recognizes a transplanted organ as non-self and may attack it. In the case of autoimmune disorders, the immune system mistakenly targets the body's own cells and tissues, causing damage and inflammation.
Mycophenolate belongs to a group of drugs called immunosuppressants that suppress the immune system and helps to prevent organ rejection, tissue inflammation, and damage. Mycophenolate acts by inhibiting formation of an enzyme necessary to produce special immune cells called T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Inhibiting lymphocyte formation decreases both immune system function and antibody production, reducing the body's immune response to transplanted organs or to its own tissues and cells.
Organ transplant recipients receive mycophenolate in conjunction with other immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Autoimmune disorder patients may be prescribed mycophenolate as a single agent, although they may take other medications. It has been used to treat lupus (especially with symptoms of kidney disease), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns disease, inflammatory eye diseases including iritis and scleritis, and some other kidney or skin disorders.
Mycophenolate, like most immunosuppressants, must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, then the person may develop toxicity. The mycophenolic acid blood test uses blood samples collected when the drugs are at their lowest, typically just prior to the next dose. Such levels are called trough levels and they are correlated to clinical side effects."

By the time a baby is born, it drops to a very low level. In adults, CEA is normally present at very low levels in the blood but may be elevated with certain types of cancer. This test measures the amount of CEA in the blood to help evaluate individuals diagnosed with cancer.
CEA is a tumor marker. Originally, it was thought that CEA was a specific marker for colon cancer, but further study has shown that an increase in CEA may be seen in a wide variety of other cancers. CEA can also be increased in some non-cancer-related conditions, such as inflammation, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, rectal polyps, emphysema, and benign breast disease, and in smokers. For this reason, it is not useful as a general cancer screening tool, but it does have a role in evaluating response to cancer treatment.

Hemoglobin enables RBCs to bind to oxygen in the lungs and carry it to tissues and organs throughout the body. It also helps transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a product of cell metabolism, from tissues and organs to the lungs, where it is exhaled.
The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin your sample of blood. A hemoglobin level can be performed alone or with a hematocrit, a test that measures the proportion of blood that is made up of RBCs, to evaluate your red blood cells. It is also one component of the complete blood count (CBC), a group of tests that are often used in the general evaluation of your health.
Red blood cells, which make up about 40% (ranging 37-49%) of the blood's volume, are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream when they are, or nearly are, mature. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days, and the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding.
Several diseases and conditions can affect RBCs and consequently the level of hemoglobin in the blood. In general, the hemoglobin level and hematocrit rise when the number of red blood cells increases. The hemoglobin level and hematocrit fall to less than normal when there is a decrease in RBCs.
Some conditions affect RBC production in the bone marrow and may cause an increase or decrease in the number of mature RBCs released into the blood circulation. Other conditions may affect the lifespan of RBCs in the circulation. If there is increased destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) or loss of RBCs through bleeding and/or the bone marrow is not able to produce new ones fast enough, then the overall number of RBCs and hemoglobin will drop, resulting in anemia.
Anemia is a condition in which tissues and organs in the body do not get enough oxygen, causing fatigue and weakness. If too many RBCs are produced, polycythemia results and the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems."

Blood consists of RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets suspended in a fluid portion called plasma. The hematocrit is a ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the volume of all these components together, called whole blood. The value is expressed as a percentage or fraction. For example, a hematocrit value of 40% means that there are 40 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of whole blood.
The hematocrit is a fairly quick and simple way of evaluating your red blood cells and checking for conditions such as anemia. It is often performed in conjunction with a hemoglobin level and is also one component of the complete blood count (CBC), a group of tests that are often used in the general evaluation of your health.
The hematocrit reflects both the number of red blood cells and their volume (mean corpuscular volume or MCV). If the number and/or size of RBCs decreases, so will the hematocrit and vice versa. In general, the hematocrit will rise when the number of red blood cells increases and the hematocrit will fall to less than normal when there is a decrease in RBCs.
RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream when they are, or nearly are, mature. They typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen. The primary function of RBCs is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. They also transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cell metabolism, from tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled.
The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days and the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect the production of new RBCs by the bone marrow. Other conditions may affect the lifespan of RBCs in the circulation. If there is increased destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) or loss of RBCs (bleeding) and/or the bone marrow is not able to produce new ones fast enough, then the overall number of RBCs and hematocrit will drop, resulting in anemia.
In anemia, the body does not have the capacity to deliver enough oxygen to tissues and organs, causing fatigue and weakness. In polycythemia, too many RBCs are produced (resulting in increased hematocrit) and the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems."

Chloride is part of the body's electrolyte balance and combines with sodium to form the salt found in sweat. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an elevated level of chloride in their sweat.
Normally, chloride travels in and out of the body's cells, helping to maintain electrical neutrality and water balance. This movement occurs through a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It serves as a channel, letting chloride out of cells and into the surrounding fluid and also reducing sodium absorption. Sodium levels thus usually mirror those of chloride.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease caused by a mutation in each of the two copies of the CFTR gene (one copy from each parent). With two mutations, the CFTR protein may be dysfunctional or totally absent. With dysfunctional or absent CFTR, chloride does not move out of the ducts into surrounding fluid, resulting in the production of thick, sticky mucus. Since CFTR levels are usually highest in the epithelial cells lining the internal surfaces of the bronchi of the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, salivary glands, intestine, and reproductive organs, these are the areas most affected by CF. (Read the article on Cystic Fibrosis to learn more.)
Dysfunctional or absent CFTR results in increased chloride in sweat, which can be measured with a sweat test. Two methods of sweat analysis are frequently used: Sweat chloride concentration is recommended as the diagnostic test for CF."

Much smaller amounts of it are also found in the heart and muscles. Normally, ALT levels in blood are low, but when the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood and the level increases. This test measures the level of ALT in the blood and is useful for early detection of liver disease.
The function of ALT is to convert alanine, an amino acid found in proteins, into pyruvate, an important intermediate in cellular energy production. In healthy individuals, ALT levels in the blood are low. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood, usually before more obvious signs of liver damage occur, such as jaundice.
The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen, just beneath the rib cage. It is involved in many important functions in the body. The liver helps to process the body's nutrients, manufactures bile to help digest fats, produces many important proteins such as blood clotting factors and albumin, and breaks down potentially toxic substances into harmless ones that the body can use or eliminate.
A number of conditions can cause damage to liver cells, resulting in an increase in ALT. The test is most useful in detecting damage due to hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or as a result of drugs or other substances that are toxic to the liver.
ALT is commonly tested in conjunction with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), another liver enzyme, as part of a liver panel. Both ALT and AST levels usually rise whenever the liver is being damaged, although ALT is more specific for the liver and, in some cases, may be the only one of the two to be increased. An AST/ALT ratio may be calculated to aid in distinguishing between different causes and severity of liver injury and to help distinguish liver injury from damage to heart or muscles."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/autoantibodies,Autoantibodies,['Autoimmune antibodies'],[],"May 6, 2019.","March 24, 2021.",What are autoantibodies?,"Autoantibodies are antibodies (immune proteins) that mistakenly target and react with a person's own tissues or organs. One or more autoantibodies may be produced by a person's immune system when it fails to distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self.""
Usually the immune system is able to discriminate between foreign substances (""non-self"") and the body’s own cells (""self""). It produces antibodies only when it perceives that it has been exposed to a threat (""non-self""), such as bacteria or viruses. However, when the immune system ceases to recognize one or more of the body's normal constituents as ""self,"" it may produce autoantibodies that react with its own cells, tissues, and/or organs. This may cause inflammation, damage, and/or dysfunction of organs or systems, leading to signs and symptoms of autoimmune disorders.
Some autoantibodies do not cause tissue injury directly but are thought to be part of an overall immune response that can cause inflammation and damage. Their presence in the blood can indicate that an autoimmune process is ongoing. Examples include antibodies related to celiac disease and type 1 diabetes.
The causes of autoimmunity are varied and are not well understood. While there is not a direct link, it is thought that many cases of autoantibody production are due to a genetic predisposition combined with an environmental trigger, such as a viral illness or prolonged exposure to certain toxic chemicals. Some families have a high prevalence of autoimmune conditions; however, individual family members may have different autoimmune disorders or may never develop one. Researchers believe that there may also be a hormonal component, as many autoimmune conditions are more common in women of childbearing age.
A recent study found that more than 32 million people in the U.S. have autoantibodies and that the prevalence of the most common type of autoantibody, antinuclear antibody (ANA), is highest among women, older individuals, and African-Americans.
The type of autoimmune disease that occurs and the amount of injury done to tissues and organs depend on which systems are targeted by the autoantibodies: Disorders caused by autoantibodies that primarily affect a single organ, such as the thyroid in Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis, are often easier to diagnose. People with these disorders frequently have signs and symptoms related to that organ."

It is a potent drug that helps to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ by the body. This test measures the amount of tacrolimus in the blood.
Normally, a person's immune system recognizes a new, transplanted organ as foreign and begin to attack it. Tacrolimus limits this response and helps to prevent organ rejection by inhibiting the activation of certain immune cells called T-lymphocytes.
The level of tacrolimus in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the concentration is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, then the person may experience symptoms associated with toxicity.
Dosages must be tailored to the individual. Often, people will begin with higher doses of tacrolimus at the start of therapy and then decrease the dose over the next few weeks.
Tacrolimus is usually taken twice a day at set intervals before or after meals. When a person takes a dose, the blood concentration rises and peaks within about 2 to 3 hours and then begins to slowly drop. The blood test is usually measured as a ""trough level,"" meaning that sample collection is timed for 12 hours post-dose and/or immediately prior to the next dose, when the drug's level in the blood is at its lowest."

The ALK gene codes for a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase. It is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cell growth.
About 4-5% of people who have non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer, have an alteration on chromosome 2 that leads to the fusion of the ALK gene with another gene (fusion partner). The most common ALK fusion partner is a gene called EML4 and results in the production of an EML4-ALK fusion protein. It is a rare mutation most commonly seen in people who have never smoked or are light smokers, especially women of Asian descent.

Normal urine protein elimination is less than 150 mg/day and less than 30 mg of albumin/day. Elevated levels may be seen temporarily with conditions such as infections, stress, pregnancy, diet, cold exposure, or heavy exercise. Persistent protein in the urine suggests possible kidney damage or some other condition that requires additional testing to determine the cause.
There are several different kinds of urine protein tests, including: A semi-quantitative protein ""dipstick"" may be performed as part of a urinalysis, generally on a random urine sample.
The quantity of protein in a 24-hour urine sample may be measured and reported as the amount of protein released per 24 hours.
The amount of protein in a random urine sample may be measured along with urine creatinine and reported as the ratio of urine protein to creatinine (UPCR).  Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally released into the urine at a constant rate. When both a urine creatinine and a random urine protein test are performed, the resulting protein/creatinine ratio approaches the accuracy of the 24-hour urine protein test. Since saving all of the urine for 24 hours can be cumbersome for adults and difficult for infants and children, a random urine protein to creatinine ratio is sometimes substituted for a 24-hour urine protein sample.
Plasma proteins are essential for all living beings. The kidneys, two organs found in the back at the bottom of the rib cage, recapture these proteins by filtering the blood by removing wastes and eliminating them from the body in the urine. When the kidneys are functioning normally, they retain or reabsorb the filtered proteins and return them to the blood.
However, if the kidneys are damaged or compromised due to other conditions, they become less effective at filtering, causing detectible amounts of protein to spill over into the urine. Routine dipstick testing of urine measures the presence of albumin. Albumin, a protein produced by the liver, makes up about 50%-60% of the protein in the blood. The rest is a mixture of globulins, including immunoglobulins. As kidney damage progresses, the amount of albumin in the urine increases, a key factor in the early detection of a potential kidney disorder.
Protein in the urine, also called proteinuria, is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and/or hypertension, with increasing amounts of protein in the urine reflecting increasing kidney damage. There are often no signs and symptoms with early kidney damage. As kidney damage progresses, or if protein loss is severe, you may develop symptoms such as fluid build-up (edema), shortness of breath, nausea, and fatigue. The production of too much protein, as seen with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and amyloidosis, can also lead to proteinuria.
The presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria) is a sensitive indicator of kidney disease in people with diabetes and/or hypertension. Therefore, it is recommended that people with these conditions be regularly screened for albumin in the urine, as opposed to total urine protein (see Urine Albumin)."

https://labtestsonline.org/tests/alpha-1-antitrypsin,Alpha-1 Antitrypsin,"['A1AT', 'AAT']",[],"May 10, 2017.","November 13, 2019.",What is being tested?,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein in the blood that protects the lungs from damage caused by activated enzymes. Laboratory tests measure the level of AAT in blood or identify abnormal forms of AAT that a person has inherited to help diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
AAT helps to inactivate several enzymes, the most important of which is elastase. Elastase is an enzyme produced by white blood cells called neutrophils and is part of the body's normal response to injury and inflammation. Elastase breaks down proteins so that they can be removed and recycled by the body. If its action is not regulated by AAT, elastase will also begin to break down and damage lung tissue.
Each individual inherits two copies of the gene that codes for AAT. It is called the protease inhibitor (SERPINA1) gene. This gene is co-dominant, which means that each SERPINA1 gene copy is responsible for producing half of the body's AAT. If there is a change or mutation in one or both of the gene copies, then less AAT and/or AAT with reduced function is produced.
When AAT production drops below 30% of normal, the affected person will experience a disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. People with this disorder are at a considerable risk of developing emphysema, a progressive lung disease, in early adulthood. If they smoke or are exposed to occupational dust or fumes, the lung damage tends to occur sooner and be more severe.
Certain types of dysfunctional AAT accumulate in the liver cells, where it is produced. As AAT builds up in these cells, it forms abnormal protein chains and begins to destroy the cells and damage the liver. About 10% of newborns with AAT deficiency have liver damage and are jaundiced. In severe cases, these infants may require a liver transplant to survive. AAT deficiency is currently the most common genetic cause of liver disease in the pediatric population.
In adults with AAT deficiency, the risk of developing chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is increased. Few adults with AAT deficiency actually have signs or symptoms of liver disease, however. The amount and function of the AAT depends on the gene mutation that is inherited. While there are more than 120 different alleles in the SERPINA1 gene, only a few are common. Most people in the U.S., about 90%, have two copies of the normal ""wild type"" M gene (MM). The most common abnormal genes are labeled S and Z."

The most common syphilis tests detect antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to a T. pallidum infection. Some methods that are used less commonly directly detect the bacterium or its genetic material (DNA).
Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics but can cause severe health problems if left untreated. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her unborn child, with serious and potentially fatal consequences for the baby. (See Common Questions below)
There are several possible stages with syphilis: Primary syphilis—the primary stage begins about 2-3 weeks after being infected. One or more chancres appear, usually on the part of the body exposed to the sexual partner's chancre, such as on the penis or vagina. However, the chancre is usually painless and may go unnoticed, especially if it is in the rectum or on the cervix, and disappears within 4-6 weeks, healing regardless of whether the infected person is treated or not.
Secondary syphilis—if primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary syphilis may occur from 6 weeks to 6 months after the chancre first appears. It is marked by a skin rash that often is rough, red, and spotted, appearing frequently on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet (an unusual place for most other causes of rashes) and that usually does not itch. There may be other symptoms as well, such as fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes (""glands""), sore throat, and body aches.
Late, tertiary syphilis—if untreated, secondary syphilis may continue into a latent stage, during which an infected person has no symptoms but continues to have the infection, and this stage can last for years. If still untreated, about 15% of people will develop the complications of late, or tertiary, syphilis. In these cases, the bacteria can damage the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones, joints, or almost any other part of the body. When the central nervous system is affected, it is called neurosyphilis. Tertiary syphilis can last for years, with the final stage leading to mental illness, blindness, other neurological problems, heart disease, and death. Syphilis is most infectious during the primary and secondary stages. In 2014, about one-third of over 63,000 new cases of syphilis reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were primary or secondary stage syphilis. Eighty-three percent of these cases were among men who have sex with men.
Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, preferably penicillin. Newly acquired infections can be cured easily; however, longer treatment may be needed for someone who has been infected for more than a year."

This test measures the amount of 17-OHP in the blood to detect and/or evaluate congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an inherited condition that results in decreased adrenal cortisol and aldosterone and increased male sex hormone (androgen) production.
17-OHP is derived from cholesterol. It is not an active steroid hormone, but is a precursor that can be converted to active hormones.
The adrenal glands produce the hormone coritsol, which helps break down protein, glucose, and lipids, maintains blood pressure, and regulates the immune system. The adrenal glands also produce other steroid hormones such as aldosterone, which helps regulate salt levels and blood pressure, and androgens, substances that, like testosterone, cause male sexual features as well as other effects.
Several enzymes are required to complete the steps involved in the production of cortisol. If one or more of these enzymes is deficient or dysfunctional, then inadequate amounts of cortisol are produced, as occurs with CAH. The most common cause of CAH is a partial or complete lack of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, accounting for about 90% of cases.
Because a low level of cortisol causes an elevation in the level of a particular pituitary hormone that stimulates adrenal growth and hormone production (adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH), the adrenal gland increases in size (adrenal hyperplasia). However, the increased size and activity cannot overcome the block in cortisol production. Other substances such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens that do not need the defective enzyme are produced in excess. This is why testing for 17-OHP can help to detect CAH.
CAH is a group of inherited disorders caused by specific gene mutations and associated with cortisol-related enzyme deficiencies. About 90% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation in the 21-hydroxylase gene (also called CYP-21 or P450c1 or CYP21A2) and may be detected due to the accumulation of 17-OHP in the blood. The disease is caused when both genes, one from each parent, have mutations that decrease or stop the activity of the enzyme for which the gene codes. Parents may be carriers, and carriers may not have any signs of the disease.
CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited as either a severe or mild type: Severe forms can cause babies to be born with serious deficiencies of both aldosterone and cortisol that will require medical attention. This severe form is most often detected in infancy during routine newborn screening or during early childhood. If not detected by screening, it may present in early childhood with signs and symptoms such as vomiting, listlessness, lack of energy (lethargy), not eating well, failure to thrive, dehydration and low blood pressure, particularly with acute illness. 	Due to the excess androgens, the development of male sexual characteristics in females (virilization) can occur. Female babies may have sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia), making it difficult to initially determine their sex. Females may have excess hair growth on face and body (hirsutism) and other male secondary sexual characteristics during childhood and adolescence as well as irregular menstruation. Males with this condition will appear normal at birth but may start to develop sexual characteristics prematurely and are at risk for fertility issues later in life. In the milder, yet more common form of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there may be only partial deficiency of the enzyme. This type, sometimes called late-onset or non-classical CAH, can have symptoms that begin to appear any time during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The symptoms can be vague, may develop slowly over time, and may vary from person to person. Though this form of CAH is not life-threatening, it may cause problems with growth, development, and puberty in children and may lead to infertility in adults."

Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common causes of vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) in women. When they occur, symptoms include: Itching, irritation, soreness of the vagina, or a burning sensation
Frothy, yellow-green or grey vaginal discharge
Foul-smelling vaginal discharge
Frequent urge to urinate
Possible blood-spotting from the vagina
Itching of inner thighs
Discomfort during intercourse In men, symptoms may include: Burning after urinating or ejaculating
Itching or irritation of the urethra
Discharge from the urethra These symptoms may take 5 to 28 days after exposure to an infected person or longer to develop; however, once diagnosed, trichomoniasis is easily treated with prescription antibiotics. During treatment, an infected person should cease sexual activity and inform partners so that they can also be treated and prevent re-infection."

Secretions from the vagina (for women) or urethra (for men) are tested by one of the following methods: Molecular testing, direct DNA probes, or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)—NAATs are the most sensitive tests for T.vaginalis and are now considered the gold standard for diagnosing it. With some NAATs, samples collected for testing of gonorrhea and chlamydial infections can also be used to test for T. vaginalis. Most NAATs can be used with both vaginal and urine samples for women. Only some are approved for use with samples from men. 	Samples from women can be obtained during a routine gynecologic examination that includes a Pap smear. However, T. vaginalis found incidentally during a Pap smear is not considered diagnostic because false positives and false negatives may occur. Wet prep—the sample is placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for the presence of the parasite. The wet prep is performed on secretions that are freshly obtained and examined promptly under the microscope without the aid of any special stains. This test has poor sensitivity, especially for samples from men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends following up with a more sensitive test (i.e., molecular testing or culture) when trichomoniasis is suspected but not confirmed by wet prep."

These mutations are tested by two separate tests that evaluate a person's DNA to look for the mutations. The two tests are often performed together to help determine if an individual has an inherited risk for excessive clotting.
Factor V and prothrombin are coagulation factors (sometimes called clotting factors), two of a group of proteins essential for proper blood clot formation. When an injury occurs and bleeding starts, a process called hemostasis begins to form a plug at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Blood cells called platelets adhere to and aggregate at the injury site, and a coagulation cascade begins to activate coagulation factors in sequence. Eventually, a blood clot forms. Once the area has healed, the blood clot dissolves.
There must be an adequate number of each of the coagulation factors, and each must function normally in order for a stable blood clot to form and then dissolve when no longer needed. A deficiency in clotting factors (quantitative defect) or clotting factors that do not work properly (qualitative defect) can lead to excessive bleeding or clotting (thrombosis).
Factor V Leiden and PT 20210 are two mutations that individuals may inherit from their parents that may cause an increased risk of excessive clotting. They are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A person may inherit one mutated gene copy and be heterozygous or may inherit two mutated gene copies and be homozygous. This may determine to what extent the person is affected. (For additional details, read the section on Autosomal Dominant Inheritance in the Genetic Disorders article.)
These two mutations are independent and are tested separately, but the tests are often performed at the same time as part of the investigation of a blood clot (thrombotic episode) in someone who is suspected of having an inherited risk factor for an excessive clotting (hypercoagulable) disorder. Each test is used to identify whether or not the specific mutation is present and to determine whether the person has one copy (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of that mutation. During blood clotting, factor V is normally inactivated by a protein called activated protein C (APC) to prevent the blood clot from growing too large. But a factor V Leiden genetic mutation can lead to an altered factor V protein that resists inactivation by APC. The result is that clotting remains more active than usual, increasing risks of a blood clot forming in the deep veins of legs (DVT) or breaking off and blocking a vein (venous thromboembolism or VTE).
During blood clotting, an enzyme converts prothrombin to form thrombin. A mutation in the gene that codes for prothrombin called prothrombin 20210 can lead to increased amount of prothrombin and therefore abnormal clotting and an increased risk of a DVT or VTE."

The level of procalcitonin in the blood can increase significantly in systemic bacterial infections and sepsis. This test measures the level of procalcitonin in the blood.
Sepsis is the body's serious, overwhelming and sometimes life-threatening inflammatory response to a bacterial infection. Normally, a person's immune system targets an infection, confining the bacteria and limiting its response to the infected area. However, some infections may begin in one site of the body and then spread to the blood (bacteremia) and possibly to other sites. With sepsis, the body produces a generalized inflammatory response to the infection. This can cause a significant rise or fall in body temperature, increased heart rate and breathing rate, and a decrease in blood pressure. If not treated successfully, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis.
Other conditions can also increase procalcitonin in the blood, but usually procalcitonin is only mildly to moderately elevated. Examples of these conditions include tissue damage due to events such as trauma, surgery, pancreatitis, burns, cardiogenic shock (related to a heart attack), acute organ transplant rejection, and kidney involvement in urinary tract infections in children.
The procalcitonin test is useful in helping to detect sepsis and severe bacterial infections in the early stages and to distinguish between a bacterial infection and other non-bacterial causes of signs and symptoms in a seriously ill person."

This test measures the amount or activity of Lp-PLA2 in the blood.
Some recent studies have shown that Lp-PLA2 is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), and ischemic stroke. In these studies, increased concentrations of Lp-PLA2 were seen in many people who were diagnosed with CHD and ischemic stroke, regardless of other risk factors. These findings make this relatively new test potentially useful as one of a growing number of cardiac risk markers that are used to help determine a person's risk of developing CVD.
CVD causes more deaths in the U.S. each year than any other cause, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CHD and ischemic stroke are both associated with the buildup of fatty plaque deposits in the arteries that can lead to blockages in blood vessels and to heart attacks or brain damage. There are a variety of risk factors that have been identified as being associated with both conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, increased LDL (low-density lipoprotein, the ""bad cholesterol""), and decreased HDL (high-density lipoprotein, the ""good cholesterol"").
Many people who have one or more of the commonly recognized risk factors will eventually develop CVD, but a significant number of people who have few or none of these risk factors will also develop CVD. This has lead researchers to look for additional markers that might identify those at increased risk of CVD.
In addition to the traditional risk factors listed above, a low level of chronic, systemic inflammation and blood vessel (vascular) inflammation are thought to contribute to overall risk for developing CVD. The hs-CRP test is associated with systemic inflammation; high levels are associated with increased CVD risk. The Lp-PLA2 test is associated with vascular inflammation, and high levels are thought to increase the chance of cardiovascular events, including heart attack or stroke. High levels of Lp-PLA2 is also associated with vascular complications in people with diabetes, such as kidney disease."

This test indirectly measures the amount of heparin in a person's blood by measuring its inhibition of factor Xa activity, one of the proteins involved in blood clot formation (known as heparin anti-Xa activity).
The test is used to monitor heparin therapy to ensure that a person is receiving sufficient heparin for anticoagulation without causing excess bleeding. Since the test involves a chemical reaction color change (colorimetric), it is also known as chromogenic anti-Xa assay or anti-Xa assay, chromogenic.
Blood clotting is a normal response to blood vessel or tissue injury. It is a complex process that involves the activation and clumping of platelets at the site of injury and the initiation of the coagulation cascade, a sequential activation of coagulation factors, proteins that produce clots and regulate their development.
There are a variety of conditions that can cause excessive clotting and lead to the formation of blood clots within veins and arteries. Some examples include surgeries, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and other excessive clotting disorders (hypercoagulable disorders). These clots can obstruct blood flow and cause tissue damage. Pieces of the blood clot can also break off and travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism. In pregnant women, blood clot formation can sometimes occur in the placenta and affect blood flow to the developing baby (fetus) and result in a miscarriage.
Heparin may be used to prevent or treat these excessive clotting conditions (anticoagulation therapy). Through its binding to the protein antithrombin, heparin interferes with the clotting process by inhibiting clotting factors, particularly factors Xa and IIa (thrombin).
Heparin molecules vary in size and activity and there are three types of heparin that may be used for treatment: Standard heparin, commonly known as unfractionated heparin (UFH), is usually given through injections into a vein (intravenously, IV). UFH affects both factors Xa and IIa and has varying effects among patients, so it must be closely monitored. Complications may include clotting (insufficient heparin), excessive bleeding (too much heparin), and sometimes decrease in platelets and thrombosis (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis).
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) consists of a narrower range of smaller heparin molecules and is typically given through injections under the skin (subcutaneous). LMWH primarily affects Xa and its effect is more predictable; therefore, routine laboratory monitoring is not required.
Fondaparinux consists of only a small fraction of UFH (a sequence of five monomeric sugar units of heparin) and only inhibits factor Xa. It does not inhibit thrombin. Like LMWH, fondaparinux is given subcutaneously and routine laboratory monitoring is not required. Unfractionated heparin is often used for initial treatment when excessive clotting conditions are acute. It is eventually replaced by the use of oral anticoagulants or LMWH for longer-term treatment to lower the risk of blood clots. UFH is usually given in a hospital setting and monitored with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test, but it may need to be monitored with the heparin anti-Xa test.
High doses of UFH given during surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass are typically monitored using the activated clotting time (ACT) test.
LMWH and fondaparinux may be given in either an outpatient or hospital setting. Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux significantly prolong PTT at therapeutic dosage. If monitoring is required, the anti-Xa test is used."

It is essential for cell signaling and the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Calcium is needed for blood clotting and is crucial for the formation, density, and maintenance of bones and teeth. This test measures the amount of calcium in the blood or urine, which reflects the amount of total and ionized calcium in the body.
About 99% of calcium is found complexed in the bones, while the remaining 1% circulates in the blood. Calcium levels are tightly controlled; if there is too little absorbed or ingested, or if there is excess loss through the kidney or gut, calcium is taken from bone to maintain blood concentrations. Roughly half of the calcium in the blood is ""free"" and is metabolically active. The remaining half is ""bound"" to proteins, primarily albumin and to a lesser extend globulins, with a smaller amount complexed to anions, such as phosphate, and these bound and complexed forms are metabolically inactive.
There are two tests to measure blood calcium. The total calcium test measures both the free and bound forms. The ionized calcium test measures only the free, metabolically active form.
Some calcium is lost from the body every day, filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted into the urine and sweat. Measurement of the amount of calcium in the urine is used to determine how much calcium the kidneys are eliminating."
