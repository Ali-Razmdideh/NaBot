17-hydroxyprogesterone,"What is a 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test?
This test measures the amount of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) in the blood. 17-OHP is a hormone made by the adrenal glands, two glands located on top of the kidneys. The adrenal glands make several hormones, including cortisol. Cortisol is important for maintaining blood pressure, blood sugar, and some functions of the immune system. 17-OHP is made as part of the process of producing cortisol.
A 17-OHP test helps diagnose a rare genetic disorder called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In CAH, a genetic change, known as a mutation, prevents the adrenal gland from making enough cortisol. As the adrenal glands work harder to make more cortisol, they produce extra 17-OHP, along with certain male sex hormones.
CAH can cause abnormal development of sex organs and sexual characteristics. Symptoms of the disorder range from mild to severe. If not treated, the more severe forms of CAH can cause serious complications, including dehydration, low blood pressure, and abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia).
Other names: 17-OH progesterone, 17-OHP
","What is it used for?A 17-OHP test is most often used to diagnose CAH in newborns. It may also be used to:Diagnose CAH in older children and adults who may have a milder form of the disorder. In milder CAH, symptoms may show up later in life, or sometimes not at all.Monitor treatment for CAH
","Why do I need a 17-OHP test?Your baby will need a 17-OHP test, usually within 1–2 days after birth. 17-OHP testing for CAH is now required by law as part of newborn screening. A newborn screening is a simple blood test that checks for a variety of serious diseases.Older children and adults may also need testing if they have symptoms of CAH. Symptoms will be different depending on how severe the disorder is, the age when symptoms appear, and whether you are male or female.Symptoms of the most severe form of the disorder usually show up within 2–3 weeks after birth.If your baby was born outside the United States and did not get a newborn screening, they may need testing if they have one or more of the following symptoms:Genitals that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)DehydrationVomiting and other feeding problemsAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia)Older children may not have symptoms until puberty. In girls, symptoms of CAH include:Irregular menstrual periods, or no periods at allEarly appearance of pubic and/or arm hairExcessive hair on face and bodyDeep voiceEnlarged clitorisIn boys, symptoms include:Enlarged penisEarly puberty (precocious puberty)In adult men and women, symptoms may include:Infertility (the inability to get pregnant or get a partner pregnant)Severe acne
","What happens during a 17-OHP test?For a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.During a blood test for older children and adults, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?There are no special preparations needed for a 17-OHP test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to you or your baby with a 17-OHP test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If results show high levels of 17-OHP, it's likely you or your child has CAH. Usually, very high levels means a more severe form of the condition, while moderately high levels usually means a milder form.If you or your child is being treated for CAH, lower levels of 17-OHP may mean the treatment is working. Treatment may include medicines to replace missing cortisol. Sometimes surgery is done to change the appearance and function of the genitals.If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a 17-OHP test?If you or your child has been diagnosed with CAH, you may want to consult with a genetic counselor, a specially trained professional in genetics. CAH is genetic disorder in which both parents must have the genetic mutation that causes CAH. A parent may be a carrier of the gene, which means they have the gene but usually don't have symptoms of disease. If both parents are carriers, each child has a 25% chance of having the condition.
"
acetaminophen level,"What is an acetaminophen level test?
This test measures the amount of acetaminophen in the blood. Acetaminophen is one of the most common medicines used in over-the-counter pain relievers and fever reducers. It is found in more than 200 brand name medicines. These include Tylenol, Excedrin, Nyquil, and Paracetamol, which is commonly found outside the U. S. Acetaminophen is safe and effective when taken at the proper dose. But an overdose can cause serious and sometimes deadly liver damage.
Unfortunately, dosing mistakes are common. Reasons for this include:

Taking more than one medicine that contains acetaminophen. Many cold, flu, and allergy medicines contain acetaminophen. If you take more than one medicine with acetaminophen, you may end up taking an unsafe dose without realizing it
Not following dose recommendations. The adult maximum dose is generally 4000 mgs in 24 hours. But that may be too much for some people. So it may be safer to limit your dose to 3000 mgs per day. Children's dosing recommendations depend on their weight and age.
Giving a child an adult version of the medicine, rather than a version designed for children

If you think you or your child has taken too much acetaminophen, call your health care provider right away. You may need to be tested and treated in the emergency room.
Other names: acetaminophen drug test, acetaminophen blood test, Paracetamol test, Tylenol drug test
","What is it used for?
The test is used to find out if you or your child has taken too much acetaminophen.
","Why do I need an acetaminophen level test?
Your provider may order a test if you or your child has symptoms of an overdose. Symptoms may happen as soon as two to three hours after taking the medicine but can take as long as 12 hours to appear.
Symptoms in adults and children are similar and may include:

Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite
Fatigue
Irritability
Sweating
Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow

","What happens during an acetaminophen level test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

acid-fast bacillus (afb) tests,"What are acid-fast bacillus (AFB) tests?
Acid-fast bacillus (AFB) is a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis and certain other infections. Tuberculosis, commonly known as TB, is a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. It can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing.
TB can be latent or active. If you have latent TB, you'll have TB bacteria in your body but won't feel sick and can't spread the disease to others. If you have active TB, you'll have symptoms of the disease and could spread the infection to others.
AFB tests are usually ordered for people with symptoms of active TB. The tests look for the presence of AFB bacteria in your sputum. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva.
There are two main types of AFB tests:

AFB smear. In this test, your sample is ""smeared"" on a glass slide and looked at under a microscope. It can provide results in 1–2 days. These results can show a possible or likely infection, but can't provide a definite diagnosis.
AFB culture. In this test, your sample is taken to a lab and put in a special environment to encourage the growth of bacteria. An AFB culture can positively confirm a diagnosis of TB or other infection. But it takes 6–8 weeks to grow enough bacteria to detect an infection.

Other names: AFB smear and culture, TB culture and sensitivity, mycobacteria smear and culture
","What are they used for?
AFB tests are most often used to diagnose an active tuberculosis (TB) infection. They may also be used to help diagnose other types of AFB infections. These include:

Leprosy, a once feared, but rare and easily treatable disease that affects the nerves, eyes, and skin. Skin often becomes red and flaky, with loss of feeling.
An infection similar to TB that mostly affects people with HIV/AIDS and others with weakened immune systems.

AFB tests may also be used for people who have already been diagnosed with TB. The tests can show if the treatment is working, and whether the infection can still be spread to others.
","Why do I need an AFB test? 
You may need an AFB test if you have symptoms of active TB. These include:

Cough that lasts for three weeks or more
Coughing up blood and/or sputum
Chest pain
Fever
Fatigue
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss 

Active TB can cause symptoms in other parts of the body besides the lungs. Symptoms vary depending on which part of the body is affected. So you may need testing if you have:

Back pain
Blood in your urine
Headache
Joint pain
Weakness

You may also need testing if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk of getting TB if you:

Have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with TB
Have HIV or another disease that weakens your immune system
Live or work in a place with a high rate of TB infection. These include homeless shelters, nursing homes, and prisons.

","What happens during AFB testing?
Your health care provider will need a sample of your sputum for both an AFB smear and an AFB culture. The two tests are usually done at the same time. To get sputum samples:

You will be asked to cough deeply and spit into a sterile container. You will need to do this for two or three days in a row. This helps make sure your sample has enough bacteria for testing.
If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a sterile saline (salt) mist that can help you cough more deeply.
If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you will first get medicine so you won't feel any pain. Then, a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into your airways. The sample may be collected by suction or with a small brush.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for an AFB smear or culture.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no risk to providing a sputum sample by coughing into a container. If you have a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure. There is also a small risk of infection and bleeding at the site where the sample is taken.
","What do the results mean?
If your results on an AFB smear or culture were negative, you probably don't have active TB. But it could also mean there weren't enough bacteria in the sample for your health care provider to make a diagnosis.
If your AFB smear was positive, it means you probably have TB or other infection, but an AFB culture is needed confirm the diagnosis. Culture results can take several weeks, so your provider may decide to treat your infection in the meantime.
If your AFB culture was positive, it means you have active TB or another type of AFB infection. The culture can identify which type of infection you have. Once you have been diagnosed, your provider may order a ""susceptibility test"" on your sample. A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will provide the most effective treatment.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about AFB testing?
If not treated, TB can be deadly. But most cases of TB can be cured if you take antibiotics as directed by your health care provider. Treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections. After a few weeks on antibiotics, you will no longer be contagious, but you will still have TB. To cure TB, you need to take antibiotics for six to nine months. The length of time depends on your overall health, age, and other factors. It's important to take the antibiotics for as long as your provider tells you, even if you feel better. Stopping early can cause the infection to come back.

adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth),"What is an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test?This test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood. ACTH is a hormone made by the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain. ACTH controls the production of another hormone called cortisol. Cortisol is made by the adrenal glands, two small glands located above the kidneys. Cortisol plays an important role in helping you to:Respond to stressFight infectionRegulate blood sugarMaintain blood pressureRegulate metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energyToo much or too little cortisol can cause serious health problems.Other names: Adrenocorticotropic hormone blood test, corticotropin
","What is it used for?
An ACTH test is often done along with a cortisol test to diagnose disorders of the pituitary or adrenal glands. These include:

Cushing's syndrome, a disorder in which the adrenal gland makes too much cortisol. It may be caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland or the use of steroid medicines. Steroids are used to treat inflammation, but can have side effects that effect cortisol levels.
Cushing's disease, a form of Cushing's syndrome. In this disorder, the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH. It is usually caused by a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland.
Addison disease, a condition in which the adrenal gland doesn't make enough cortisol.
Hypopituitarism, a disorder in which the pituitary gland does not make enough of some or all of its hormones.

allergy blood test,"What is an allergy blood test?Allergies are a common and chronic condition that involves the body's immune system. Normally, your immune system works to fight off viruses, bacteria, and other infectious agents. When you have an allergy, your immune system treats a harmless substance, like dust or pollen, as a threat. To fight this perceived threat, your immune system makes antibodies called immunoglobulin E (IgE).Substances that cause an allergic reaction are called allergens. Besides dust and pollen, other common allergens include animal dander, foods, including nuts and shellfish, and certain medicines, such as penicillin. Allergy symptoms can range from sneezing and a stuffy nose to a life-threatening complication called anaphylactic shock. Allergy blood tests measure the amount of IgE antibodies in the blood. A small amount of IgE antibodies is normal. A larger amount of IgE may mean you have an allergy.Other names: IgE allergy test, Quantitative IgE, Immunoglobulin E, Total IgE, Specific IgE
","What is it used for?Allergy blood tests are used to find out if you have an allergy. One type of test called a total IgE test measures the overall number of IgE antibodies in your blood. Another type of allergy blood test called a specific IgE test measures the level of IgE antibodies in response to individual allergens.
","Why do I need an allergy blood test?Your health care provider may order allergy testing if you have symptoms of an allergy. These include:Stuffy or runny noseSneezingItchy, watery eyesHives (a rash with raised red patches)DiarrheaVomitingShortness of breathCoughingWheezing
","What happens during an allergy blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an allergy blood test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having an allergy blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your total IgE levels are higher than normal, it likely means you have some kind of allergy. But it does not reveal what you are allergic to. A specific IgE test will help identify your particular allergy. If your results indicate an allergy, your health care provider may refer you to an allergy specialist or recommend a treatment plan.Your treatment plan will depend on the type and severity of your allergy. People at risk for anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction that can cause death, need to take extra care to avoid the allergy-causing substance. They may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment with them at all times.Be sure to talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your test results and/or your allergy treatment plan.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy blood test?An IgE skin test is another way to detect allergies, by measuring IgE levels and looking for a reaction directly on the skin. Your health care provider may order an IgE skin test instead of, or in addition to, an IgE allergy blood test.
"
allergy skin test,"What is an allergy skin test?
An allergy is an overreaction, also known as a hypersensitivity, of the body's immune system. Normally, your immune system works to fight off foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. When you have an allergy, your immune system treats a harmless substance, like dust or pollen, as a threat. To fight this perceived threat, your immune system reacts and causes an allergic reaction. Symptoms of an allergic reaction can range from sneezing and a stuffy nose to a life-threatening condition known as anaphylactic shock.
There are four main types of overreactions, known as Type 1 through Type IV hypersensitivities. Type 1 hypersensitivity causes some of the most common allergies. These include dust mites, pollens, foods, and animal dander. Other types of hypersensitivities cause different immune system overreactions. These range from mild skin rashes to serious autoimmune disorders.
An allergy skin test usually checks for allergies caused by Type 1 hypersensitivity. The test looks for reactions to specific allergens that are placed on the skin.
Other names: type 1 hypersensitivity skin test, hypersensitivity test allergy scratch test, allergy patch test, intradermal test
","What is it used for?
An allergy skin test is used to diagnose certain allergies. The test can show which substances (allergens) are causing your allergic reaction. These substances may include pollen, dust, molds, and medicines such as penicillin. The tests are not usually used to diagnose food allergies. This is because food allergies are more likely to cause anaphylactic shock.
","Why do I need an allergy skin test?
Your health care provider may order allergy testing if you have symptoms of an allergy. These include:

Stuffy or runny nose
Sneezing
Itchy, watery eyes
Hives, a rash with raised red patches
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Shortness of breath
Coughing
Wheezing

","What happens during an allergy skin test?
You will most likely get tested by an allergist or a dermatologist. You may get one or more of the following allergy skin tests:
An allergy scratch test, also known as a skin prick test. During the test:

Your provider will place small drops of specific allergens at different spots on your skin.
Your provider will then lightly scratch or prick your skin through each drop.
If you are allergic to any allergens, you will develop a small red bump at the site or sites within about 15 to 20 minutes.

An intradermal test. During the test:

Your provider will use a tiny, thin needle to inject a small amount of allergen just below the skin surface.
Your provider will watch the site for a reaction.

This test is sometimes used if your allergy scratch test was negative, but your provider still thinks you have an allergy.
An allergy patch test. During the test:

A provider will place small patches on your skin. The patches look like adhesive bandages. They contain small amounts of specific allergens.
You'll wear the patches for 48 to 96 hours and then return to your provider's office.
Your provider will remove the patches and check for rashes or other reactions.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test. These include antihistamines and antidepressants. Your health care provider will let you know which medicines to avoid before your test and how long to avoid them.
If your child is being tested, the provider may apply a numbing cream to his or her skin before the test. 
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having allergy skin tests. The test itself is not painful. The most common side effect is red, itchy skin at the test sites. In very rare cases, an allergy skin test may cause anaphylactic shock. This is why skin tests need to be done in a provider's office where emergency equipment is available. If you've had a patch test and feel intense itching or pain under the patches once you are home, remove the patches and call your provider.
","What do the results mean?
If you have red bumps or swelling at any of the testing sites, it probably means you are allergic to those substances. Usually the larger the reaction, the more likely you are to be allergic.
If you are diagnosed with an allergy, your provider will recommend a treatment plan. The plan may include:

Avoiding the allergen when possible
Medicines
Lifestyle changes such as reducing dust in your home

If you are at risk for anaphylactic shock, you may need to carry an emergency epinephrine treatment with you at all times. Epinephrine is a drug used to treat severe allergies. It comes in a device that contains a premeasured amount of epinephrine. If you experience symptoms of anaphylactic shock, you should inject the device into your skin, and call 911.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an allergy skin test?
If you have a skin condition or other disorder that prevents you from getting an allergy skin test, your provider may recommend an allergy blood test instead.
"
alpha-1 antitrypsin test,"What is an alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) test?
This test measures the amount of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) in the blood. AAT is a protein that is made in the liver. It helps protect your lungs from damage and diseases, such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

AAT is made by certain genes in your body. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your parents. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Everyone inherits two copies of the gene that makes AAT, one from their father and one from their mother. If there is a mutation (change) in one or both copies of this gene, your body will make less AAT or AAT that doesn't work as well as it should.

If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45.
If you have one mutated AAT gene, you may have lower than normal amounts of AAT, but mild or no symptoms of disease. People with one mutated gene are carriers of AAT deficiency. This means you don't have the condition, but you could pass the mutated gene on to your children.

An AAT test can help show if you have the genetic mutation that puts you at risk for disease.
Other names: A1AT, AAT, alpha-1-antiprotease deficiency, α1-antitrypsin
","What is it used for?
An AAT test is most often used to help diagnose AAT deficiency in people who develop lung disease at an early age (45 years or younger) and do not have other risk factors such as smoking.

The test may also be used to diagnose a rare form of liver disease in infants.
","Why do I need an AAT test?
You may need an AAT test if you are under the age of 45, are not a smoker, and have symptoms of lung disease, including:

Wheezing
Shortness of breath
Chronic cough
Faster than normal heartbeat when you stand up
Vision problems
Asthma that doesn't respond well to treatment

You may also get this test if you have a family history of AAT deficiency.
AAT deficiency in babies often affects the liver. So your baby may need an AAT test if his or her health care provider finds signs of liver disease. These include:

Jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and eyes that lasts for more than a week or two
An enlarged spleen
Frequent itching

","What happens during an AAT test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for an AAT test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little physical risk to a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show a lower than normal amount of AAT, it probably means you have one or two mutated AAT genes. The lower the level, the more likely it is you have two mutated genes and AAT deficiency.
If you are diagnosed with AAT deficiency, you can take steps to reduce your risk of disease. These include:

Not smoking. If you are a smoker, quit smoking. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is the leading risk factor for life-threatening lung disease in people with AAT deficiency.
Following a healthy diet
Getting regular exercise
Seeing your health care provider regularly
Taking medicines as prescribed by your provider

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an AAT test?
Before agreeing to be tested, it may help to speak with a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. A counselor can help you understand the risks and benefits of testing. If you are tested, a counselor can help you understand the results and provide information on the condition, including your risk of passing the disease on to your children.

alpha-fetoprotein (afp) test,"What is an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test?Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced in the liver of a developing fetus. During a baby's development, some AFP passes through the placenta and into the mother's blood. An AFP test measures the level of AFP in pregnant women during the second trimester of pregnancy. Too much or too little AFP in a mother's blood may be sign of a birth defect or other condition. These include:A neural tube defect, a serious condition that causes abnormal development of a developing baby's brain and/or spineDown syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disabilities and developmental delaysTwins or multiple births, because more than one baby is producing AFPMiscalculation of due date, because AFP levels change during pregnancyOther names: AFP Maternal; Maternal Serum AFP; msAFP screen

You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. Another test called amniocentesis provides a more accurate diagnosis of Down syndrome and other birth defects, but the test has a small risk of causing a miscarriage.
","What do the results mean?If your results show higher than normal AFP levels, it may mean your baby has a neural tube defect such as spina bifida, a condition in which the bones of the spine don't close around the spinal cord, or anencephaly, a condition in which the brain does not develop properly.If your results show lower than normal AFP levels, it may mean your baby has a genetic disorder such as Down syndrome, a condition that causes intellectual and developmental problems.If your AFP levels are not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem with your baby. It may mean you are having more than one baby or that your due date is wrong. You may also get a false-positive result. That means your results show a problem, but your baby is healthy. If your results show a higher or lower than normal level of AFP, you will likely get more tests to help make a diagnosis.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an AFP test?AFP tests are often part of a series of prenatal tests called multiple marker or triple screen tests. In addition to AFP, a triple screen test includes tests for hCG, a hormone produced by the placenta, and estriol, a form of estrogen made by the fetus. These tests can help diagnose Down syndrome and other genetic disorders.If you are at higher risk for having a baby with certain birth defects, your provider may also recommend a newer test called cell-free DNA (cfDNA).  This is a blood test that can be given as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. It can show can show if your baby has a higher chance of having Down syndrome or certain other genetic disorders.

alpha fetoprotein (afp) tumor marker test,"What is an AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) tumor marker test?AFP stands for alpha-fetoprotein. It is a protein made in the liver of a developing baby. AFP levels are usually high when a baby is born, but fall to very low levels by the age of 1. Healthy adults should have very low levels of AFP.An AFP tumor marker test is a blood test that measures the levels of AFP in adults. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body. High levels of AFP can be a sign of liver cancer or cancer of the ovaries or testicles, as well as noncancerous liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis.High AFP levels don't always mean cancer, and normal levels don't always rule out cancer. So an AFP tumor marker test is not usually used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer. But it can help diagnose cancer when used with other tests. The test may also be used to help monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatment and to see if cancer has returned after you've finished treatment.Other names: total AFP, alpha-fetoprotein-L3 Percent
","What is it used for?An AFP tumor marker test may be used to:Help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of liver cancer or cancer of the ovaries or testicles.Monitor cancer treatment. AFP levels often go up if cancer is spreading and go down when treatment is working.See if cancer has returned after treatment.Monitor the health of people with cirrhosis or hepatitis.

"
ammonia levels,"What is an ammonia levels test?This test measures the level of ammonia in your blood. Ammonia, also known as NH3, is a waste product made by your body during the digestion of protein. Normally, ammonia is processed in the liver, where it is changed into another waste product called urea. Urea is passed through the body in urine.If your body can't process or eliminate ammonia, it builds up in the bloodstream. High ammonia levels in the blood can lead to serious health problems, including brain damage, coma, and even death.High ammonia levels in the blood are most often caused by liver disease. Other causes include kidney failure and genetic disorders.Other names: NH3 test, blood ammonia test, serum ammonia, ammonia; plasma
","What is it used for?
An ammonia levels test may be used to diagnose and/or monitor conditions that cause high ammonia levels. These include:

Hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that happens when the liver is too diseased or damaged to properly process ammonia. In this disorder, ammonia builds up in the blood and travels to the brain. It can cause confusion, disorientation, coma, and even death.
Reye syndrome, a serious and sometimes fatal condition that causes damage to the liver and brain. It mostly affects children and teenagers who are recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or the flu and have taken aspirin to treat their illnesses. The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown. But because of the risk, children and teens should not take aspirin unless specifically recommended by your health care provider.
Urea cycle disorders, rare genetic defects that affect the body's ability to change ammonia into urea.

The test may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for liver disease or kidney failure.
","Why do I need an ammonia levels test?You may need this test if you have liver disease and are showing symptoms of a brain disorder. Symptoms include:ConfusionExcessive sleepinessDisorientation, the condition of being confused about time, place, and/or your surroundingsMood swingsHand tremorsYour child may need this test if he or she has symptoms of Reye syndrome.

"
amniocentesis (amniotic fluid test),"What is amniocentesis?
Amniocentesis is a test for pregnant women that looks at a sample of amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is a pale, yellow liquid that surrounds and protects an unborn baby throughout pregnancy. The fluid contains cells that provide important information about your unborn baby's health. The information may include whether your baby has a certain birth defect or genetic disorder.
Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test. That means it will tell you whether your baby has a specific health problem. The results are almost always correct. It's different from a screening test. Prenatal screenings tests pose no risk to you or your baby, but they don't provide a definite diagnosis. They can only show if your baby might have a health problem. If your screening tests were not normal, your provider may recommend an amniocentesis or other diagnostic test.
Other names: amniotic fluid analysis
","What is it used for?
Amniocentesis is used to diagnose certain health problems in an unborn baby. These include:

Genetic disorders, which are often caused by changes (mutations) in certain genes. These include cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease.
Chromosome disorders, a type of genetic disorder caused by extra, missing, or abnormal chromosomes. The most common chromosome disorder in the United States is Down syndrome. This disorder causes intellectual disabilities and various health problems.
A neural tube defect, a condition that causes abnormal development of a baby's brain and/or spine

The test may also be used to check your baby's lung development. Checking lung development is important if you are at risk for giving birth early (premature delivery).
","Why do I need amniocentesis?
You may want this test if you are at higher risk for having a baby with a health problem. Risk factors include:

Your age. Women who are age 35 or older are at higher risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder.
Family history of a genetic disorder or birth defect
Partner who is a carrier of a genetic disorder
Having had a baby with a genetic disorder in a previous pregnancy
Rh incompatibility. This condition causes a mother's immune system to attack her baby's red blood cells.

Your provider may also recommend this test if any of your prenatal screening tests were not normal.
","What happens during amniocentesis?
The test is usually done between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. It is sometimes done later in pregnancy to check the baby's lung development or diagnose certain infections.
During the procedure:

You'll lie on your back on an exam table.
Your provider may apply a numbing medicine to your abdomen.
Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby.
Using the ultrasound images as a guide, your provider will insert a thin needle into your abdomen and withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid.
Once the sample is removed, your provider will use the ultrasound to check your baby's heartbeat.

The procedure usually takes about 15 minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Depending on the stage of your pregnancy, you may be asked to keep a full bladder or to empty your bladder right before the procedure. In early pregnancy, a full bladder helps move the uterus into a better position for the test. In later pregnancy, an empty bladder helps make sure the uterus is well positioned for testing.
","Are there any risks to the test?
You may have some mild discomfort and/or cramping during and/or after the procedure, but serious complications are rare. The procedure does have a slight risk (less than 1 percent) of causing a miscarriage. 
","What do the results mean?
If your results were not normal, it may mean your baby has one of the following conditions:

A genetic disorder
A neural tube birth defect
Rh incompatibility
Infection
Immature lung development

It may help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. He or she can help you understand what your results mean.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about amniocentesis?
Amniocentesis isn't for everyone. Before you decide to get tested, think about how you'd feel and what you might do after learning the results. You should discuss your questions and concerns with your partner and your health care provider.

amylase test,"What is an amylase test?An amylase test measures the amount of amylase in your blood or urine. Amylase is an enzyme, or special protein, that helps you digest food. Most of your amylase is made in the pancreas and salivary glands. A small amount of amylase in your blood and urine is normal. A larger or smaller amount may mean that you have a disorder of the pancreas, an infection, alcoholism, or another medical condition.Other names: Amy test, serum amylase, urine amylase
","What is it used for?An amylase blood test is used to diagnose or monitor a problem with your pancreas, including pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas. An amylase urine test may be ordered along with or after an amylase blood test. Urine amylase results can help diagnose pancreatic and salivary gland disorders. One or both types of tests may be used to help monitor amylase levels in people who are being treated for pancreatic or other disorders.
","Why do I need an amylase test?Your health care provider may order an amylase blood and/or urine test if you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder. These symptoms include:Nausea and vomitingSevere abdominal painLoss of appetiteFeverYour provider may also order an amylase test to monitor an existing condition, such as:PancreatitisPregnancyEating disorder
","What happens during an amylase test?For an amylase blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For an amylase urine test, you will be given instructions to provide a ""clean catch"" sample. The clean catch method includes the following steps:Wash your handsClean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.Start to urinate into the toilet.Move the collection container under your urine stream.Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.Finish urinating into the toilet.Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.Your health care provider may request that you collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. For this test, your health care provider or laboratory will give you a container and specific instructions on how to collect your samples at home. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully. This 24-hour urine sample test is used because the amounts of substances in urine, including amylase, can vary throughout the day.

ana (antinuclear antibody) test,"What is an ANA (antinuclear antibody) test?An ANA test looks for antinuclear antibodies in your blood. If the test finds antinuclear antibodies in your blood, it may mean you have an autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder causes your immune system to attack your own cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake. These disorders can cause serious health problems.Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. But an antinuclear antibody attacks your own healthy cells instead. It's called ""antinuclear"" because it targets the nucleus (center) of the cells.Other names: antinuclear antibody panel, fluorescent antinuclear antibody, FANA, ANA
","What is it used for?An ANA test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders, including:Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This is the most common type of lupus, a chronic disease affecting multiple parts of the body, including the joints, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain.Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes pain and swelling of the joints, mostly in the hands and feetScleroderma, a rare disease affecting the skin, joints, and blood vesselsSjogren's syndrome, a rare disease affecting the body's moisture-making glands

"
anion gap blood test,"What is an anion gap blood test?An anion gap blood test is a way to check the levels of acid in your blood. The test is based on the results of another blood test called an electrolyte panel. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the balance of chemicals in your body called acids and bases. Some of these minerals have a positive electric charge. Others have a negative electric charge. The anion gap is a measurement of the difference-or gap-between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes. If the anion gap is either too high or too low, it may be a sign of a disorder in your lungs, kidneys, or other organ systems.Other names: Serum anion gap
","What is it used for?The anion gap blood test is used to show whether your blood has an imbalance of electrolytes or too much or not enough acid. Too much acid in the blood is called acidosis. If your blood does not have enough acid, you may have a condition called alkalosis.
","Why do I need an anion gap blood test?Your health care provider may have ordered an anion gap blood test if you have signs of an imbalance in your blood acid levels. These signs may include:Shortness of breathVomitingAbnormal heartbeatConfusion
","What happens during an anion gap blood test?The anion gap test is taken from the results of an electrolyte panel, which is a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional uses a small needle to take a blood sample from a vein in your arm. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an anion gap blood test. If your health care provider has also ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.

anoscopy,"What is an anoscopy?
An anoscopy is a procedure that uses a small tube called an anoscope to view the lining of your anus and rectum. A related procedure called high resolution anoscopy uses a special magnifying device called a colposcope along with an anoscope to view these areas.
The anus is the opening of the digestive tract where the stool leaves the body. The rectum is a section of the digestive tract located above the anus. It's where stool is held before it exits the body through the anus. An anoscopy can help a health care provider find problems in the anus and rectum, including hemorrhoids, fissures (tears), and abnormal growths.
","What is it used for?
An anoscopy is most often used to diagnose:

Hemorrhoids, a condition that causes swollen, irritated veins around the anus and lower rectum. They can be inside the anus or on the skin around the anus. Hemorrhoids are usually not serious, but they can cause bleeding and discomfort.
Anal fissures, small tears in the lining of the anus
Anal polyps, abnormal growths on the lining of the anus
Inflammation. The test can help find the cause of unusual redness, swelling, and/or irritation around the anus.
Cancer. High resolution anoscopy is often used to look for cancer of the anus or rectum. The procedure can make it easier for your health care provider to find abnormal cells.

","Why do I need an anoscopy?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a problem in your anus or rectum. These include:

Blood in your stool or on toilet paper after a bowel movement
Itching around the anus
Swelling or hard lumps around the anus
Painful bowel movements

","What happens during an anoscopy?
An anoscopy may be done in a provider's office or outpatient clinic.
During an anoscopy:

You will put on a gown and remove your underwear.
You will lie on an exam table. You will either lie on your side or kneel on the table with your rear end raised in the air.
Your provider will gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your anus to check  for hemorrhoids, fissures, or other problems. This is known as digital rectal exam.
Your provider will then insert a lubricated tube called an anoscope about two inches into your anus.
Some anoscopes have a light on the end to give your provider a better view of the anus and lower rectum area.
If your provider finds cells that don't look normal, he or she may use a swab or other tool to collect a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). High resolution anoscopy may be better than regular anoscopy at finding abnormal cells.

During a high resolution anoscopy:

Your provider will insert a swab coated with a liquid called acetic acid through the anoscope and into the anus.
The anoscope will be removed, but the swab will remain.
The acetic acid on the swab will cause abnormal cells to turn white.
After a few minutes, your provider will remove the swab and reinsert the anoscope, along with a magnifying instrument called a colposcope.
Using the colposcope, your provider will look for any cells that have turned white.
If abnormal cells are found, your provider will take a biopsy.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may want to empty your bladder and/or have a bowel movement before the test. This may make the procedure more comfortable. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test? 
There is very little risk to having an anoscopy or a high resolution anoscopy. You may have some discomfort during the procedure. You may also feel a little pinch if your provider took a biopsy.
In addition, you may have a little bleeding when the anoscope is pulled out, especially if you have hemorrhoids.
","What do the results mean?
Your results may show a problem with your anus or rectum. These may include:

Hemorrhoids
Anal fissure
Anal polyp
Infection
Cancer. The biopsy results can confirm or rule out cancer.

Depending on the results, your provider may recommend more tests and/or treatment options.

antibiotic sensitivity test,"What is an antibiotic sensitivity test?
Antibiotics are medicines used to fight bacterial infections. There are different types of antibiotics. Each type is only effective against certain bacteria. An antibiotic sensitivity test can help find out which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.
The test can also be helpful in finding a treatment for antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when standard antibiotics become less effective or ineffective against certain bacteria. Antibiotic resistance can turn once easily treatable diseases into serious, even life-threatening illnesses. 
Other names: antibiotic susceptibility test, sensitivity testing, antimicrobial susceptibility test
","What is it used for?
An antibiotic sensitivity test is used to help find the best treatment for a bacterial infection. It may also be used to find out which treatment will work best on certain fungal infections.
","Why do I need an antibiotic sensitivity test?
You may need this test if you have an infection that has been shown to have antibiotic resistance or is otherwise hard to treat. These include tuberculosis, MRSA, and C. diff. You may also need this test if you have a bacterial or fungal infection that is not responding to standard treatments.
","What happens during an antibiotic sensitivity test?
The test is done by taking a sample from the infected site. The most common types of tests are listed below.

Blood culture

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.


Urine culture

You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.


Wound culture

Your health care provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.


Sputum culture

You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.


Throat culture

Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.



","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
There are no special preparations needed for an antibiotic sensitivity test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood culture test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

anti-müllerian hormone test,"What is an anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) test?This test measures the level of anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) in the blood. AMH is made in the reproductive tissues of both males and females. The role of AMH and whether levels are normal depend on your age and gender.AMH plays an important role in the development of sex organs in an unborn baby. During the first weeks of pregnancy, a baby will start developing reproductive organs. The baby will already have the genes to become either a male (XY genes) or a female (XX genes).If the baby has male (XY) genes, high levels of AMH are made, along with other male hormones. This prevents the development of female organs and promotes the formation of male organs. If there is not enough AMH to stop the development of female organs, organs of both sexes may form. When this happens, a baby's genitals may not be clearly identified as male or female. This is known as ambiguous genitalia. Another name for this condition is intersex.If the unborn baby has female (XX) genes small amounts of AMH are made. This allows for the development of female reproductive organs. AMH has a different role for females after puberty. At that time, the ovaries (glands that make egg cells) begin making AMH. The more egg cells there are, the higher the level of AMH.In women, AMH levels can provide information about fertility, the ability to get pregnant. The test may also be used to help diagnose menstrual disorders or to monitor the health of women with certain types of ovarian cancer.Other names: AMH hormone test, müllerian-inhibiting hormone, MIH, müllerian inhibiting factor, MIF, müllerian-inhibiting substance, MIS
","What is it used for?An AMH test is often used to check a woman's ability to produce eggs that can be fertilized for pregnancy. A woman's ovaries can make thousands of eggs during her childbearing years. The number declines as a woman gets older. AMH levels help show how many potential egg cells a woman has left. This is known as the ovarian reserve.If a woman's ovarian reserve is high, she may have a better chance of getting pregnant. She may also be able to wait months or years before trying to get pregnant. If the ovarian reserve is low, it may mean a woman will have trouble getting pregnant, and should not delay very long before trying to have a baby.AMH tests may also be used to:Predict the start of menopause, a time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old.Find out the reason for early menopauseHelp find out the reason for amenorrhea, the lack of menstruation. It is most often diagnosed in girls who haven't started menstruating by the age of 15 and in women who have missed several periods.Help diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that is a common cause of female infertility, the inability to get pregnantCheck infants with genitals that are not clearly identified as male or femaleMonitor women who have certain types of ovarian cancer
","Why do I need an AMH test?You may need an AMH test if you are a woman who is having difficulty getting pregnant. The test can help show what your chances are of conceiving a baby. If you are already seeing a fertility specialist, your doctor may use the test to predict whether you will respond well to treatment, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).High levels may mean you may have more eggs available and will respond better to treatment. Low levels of AMH mean you may have fewer eggs available and may not respond well to treatment.You may also need an AMH test if you are a woman with symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). These include:Menstrual disorders, including early menopause or amenorrheaAcneExcess body and facial hair growthDecreased breast sizeWeight gainIn addition, you may need an AMH test if you are being treated for ovarian cancer. The test can help show if your treatment is working.
","What happens during an AMH test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.

","What do the results mean?If you are a woman trying to get pregnant, your results can help show what your chances are for conceiving. It can also help you decide when to try to get pregnant. A high level of AMH can mean your chances are better and you may have more time before trying to get pregnant.A high level of AMH may also mean you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). There is no cure for PCOS, but symptoms can be managed with medications and/or lifestyle changes, such as maintaining a healthy diet and waxing or shaving to remove excess body hair.A low level can mean you may have trouble getting pregnant. It can also mean that you are starting menopause. A low level of AMH is normal in young girls and in women after menopause.If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, your test can show whether your treatment is working.In a male infant, a low level of AMH may mean a genetic and/or hormonal problem causing genitals that are not clearly male or female. If AMH levels are normal, it may mean the baby has working testicles, but they are not in the right location. This condition can be treated with surgery and/or hormone therapy.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an AMH test?If you are a woman being treated for fertility problems, you will probably get other tests, along with AMH. These include tests for estradiol and FSH, two hormones involved in reproduction.

antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (anca) test,"What is an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) test?This test looks for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in your blood. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. But ANCAs attack healthy cells known as neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) by mistake. This can lead to a disorder known as autoimmune vasculitis. Autoimmune vasculitis causes inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels.Blood vessels carry blood from your heart to your organs, tissues, and other systems, and then back again. Types of blood vessels include arteries, veins, and capillaries. Inflammation in the blood vessels can cause serious health problems. Problems vary depending on which blood vessels and body systems are affected.There are two main kinds of ANCA. Each targets a specific protein inside white blood cells:pANCA, which targets a protein called MPO (myeloperoxidase)cANCA, which targets a protein called PR3 (proteinase 3)The test can show whether you have one or both types of antibodies. This can help your health care provider diagnose and treat your disorder.Other names: ANCA antibodies, cANCA pANCA, cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies, serum, anticytoplasmic autoantibodies
","What is it used for?
An ANCA test is most often used to find out if you have a type of autoimmune vasculitis. There are different types of this disorder. They all cause inflammation and swelling of blood vessels, but each type affects different blood vessels and parts of the body. Types of autoimmune vasculitis include:

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously called Wegener's disease. It most often affects the lungs, kidneys, and sinuses.
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). This disorder can affect several organs in the body, including the lungs, kidneys, nervous system, and skin.
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), previously called Churg-Strauss syndrome. This disorder usually affects the skin and lungs. It often causes asthma.
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). This disorder most often affects the heart, kidneys, skin, and central nervous system.

appendicitis tests,"What are appendicitis tests?Appendicitis is an inflammation or infection of the appendix. The appendix is a small pouch attached to the large intestine. It's located in the lower right side of your abdomen. The appendix has no known function, but appendicitis can cause serious health problems if not treated.Appendicitis happens when there is some kind of blockage in the appendix. A blockage can be caused by stool, a parasite, or other foreign substance. When the appendix is blocked, bacteria build up inside it, leading to pain, swelling, and infection. If not treated promptly, the appendix can burst, spreading infection throughout your body. A burst appendix is a serious, sometimes life-threatening condition.Appendicitis is very common, mostly affecting teens and adults in their early twenties, but it can happen at any age. Appendicitis tests help diagnose the condition, so it can be treated before the appendix bursts. The main treatment for appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix.
","What are they used for?The tests are used for people with appendicitis symptoms. They can help diagnose appendicitis before it causes serious complications.
","Why do I need appendicitis testing?You may need testing if you have symptoms of appendicitis. The most common symptom is pain in the abdomen. The pain often starts by your belly button and shifts to your lower right abdomen. Other appendicitis symptoms include:Abdominal pain that gets worse when you cough or sneezeAbdominal pain that gets worse after a few hoursNausea and vomitingDiarrhea or constipationFeverLoss of appetiteAbdominal bloating
","What happens during appendicitis testing?
Appendicitis tests usually include a physical exam of your abdomen and one or more of the following:

Blood test to check for signs of infection. A high white blood cell count is a sign of an infection, including, but not limited to, appendicitis.
Urine test to rule out a urinary tract infection.
Imaging tests, such as an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, to view the inside of your abdomen. Imaging tests are often used to help confirm a diagnosis, if a physical exam and/or blood test show possible appendicitis.

During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
For a urine test,  you will need to provide a sample of your urine. The test may include the following steps:

Wash your hands.
Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.
Start to urinate into the toilet.
Move the collection container under your urine stream.
Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.
Finish urinating into the toilet.
Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.

An abdominal ultrasound uses sound waves to view the inside of your abdomen. During the procedure:

You will lie on an exam table.
A special gel will be placed on your skin over the abdomen.
A handheld probe called a transducer will be moved over the abdomen.

A CT scan uses a computer that's linked to an x-ray machine to create a series of pictures of the inside of your body. Before the scan, you may need to take in a substance called contrast dye. Contrast dye helps the images show up better in the x-ray. You may get contrast dye through an intravenous line or by drinking it.
During the scan:

You will lie on a table that slides into the CT scanner.
The scanner's beam will rotate around you as it takes pictures.
The scanner will take pictures at different angles to create three-dimensional images of your appendix.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests?You don't need any special preparations for a blood or urine test.For an abdominal ultrasound or CT scan, you may be asked to not eat or drink for several hours before the procedure. If you have questions about how to prepare for your test, talk to your health care provider.
","Are there any risks to the tests?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.There is no risk to having a urine test.An ultrasound may feel a bit uncomfortable, but there is no risk.If you've taken contrast dye for a CT scan, it may taste chalky or metallic. If you got it through an IV, you may feel a slight burning sensation. The dye is safe in most cases, but some people may have an allergic reaction to it.
","What do the results mean?If your urine test is positive, it may mean you have a urinary tract infection instead of appendicitis.If you have appendicitis symptoms and your blood test shows a high white cell count, your provider may order an abdominal ultrasound and/or a CT scan to help confirm a diagnosis.If appendicitis is confirmed, you will have surgery to remove the appendix. You may get this surgery, called an appendectomy, as soon as you are diagnosed.Most people recover very quickly if the appendix is removed before it bursts. If surgery is done after the appendix bursts, recovery may take longer and you may have to spend more time in the hospital. After surgery, you will take antibiotics to help prevent infection. You may need to take the antibiotics for a longer time if your appendix burst before surgery.You can live a completely normal life without an appendix.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about appendicitis testing?Sometimes the tests misdiagnose appendicitis. During surgery, the surgeon may find that your appendix is normal. He or she may remove it anyway to prevent appendicitis in the future. Your surgeon may continue to look in the abdomen to find the cause of your symptoms. He or she may even be able to treat the problem at the same time. But you may need more tests and procedures before a diagnosis can be made.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disorder of the brain that affects a person's behavior, communication, and social skills. The disorder usually shows up in the first two years of life. ASD is called a ""spectrum"" disorder because there is a wide range of symptoms. Autism symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some children with ASD may never be able to function without support from parents and caregivers. Others need less support and may eventually live independently.
ASD screening is the first step in diagnosing the disorder. While there is no cure for ASD, early treatment can help reduce autism symptoms and improve quality of life.
Other names: ASD screening
","What is it used for?
Autism spectrum disorder screening is most often used to check for signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children aged 2 and under.
",,"What happens during an autism spectrum disorder screening?
There is no special test for ASD. Screening usually includes:

A questionnaire for parents that asks for information about their child's development and behavior.
Observation. Your child's provider will look at how your child plays and interacts with others.
Tests that ask your child to perform tasks that check their thinking skills and ability to make decisions.

Sometimes a physical problem can cause autism-like symptoms. So screening may also include:

Blood tests to check for lead poisoning and other disorders
Hearing tests. A hearing problem can cause problems in language skills and social interaction.
Genetic tests. These tests look for inherited disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. Fragile X causes intellectual disabilities and symptoms similar to ASD. It most often affects boys.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare my child for autism spectrum disorder screening?
There are no special preparations needed for this screening.
","Are there any risks to screening?
There is no risk to having autism spectrum disorder screening.
","What do the results mean?
If results show signs of ASD, your provider may refer you to specialists for more testing and/or treatment. These specialists may include a:

Developmental pediatrician. A doctor who specializes in treating children with special needs.
Neuropsychologist. A doctor who specializes in understanding the relationship between the brain and behavior.
Child psychologist. A health care provider who specializes in treating mental health and behavioral, social, and development issues in children.

If your child is diagnosed with ASD, it's important to get treatment as soon as possible. Early treatment can help make the most of your child's strengths and abilities. Treatment has been shown to improve behavior, communication, and social skills.
ASD treatment involves services and support from a variety of providers and resources. If your child is diagnosed with ASD, talk to his or her provider about making a treatment strategy.
","Is there anything else I need to know about autism spectrum disorder screening?
There is no one single cause of autism spectrum disorder. Research suggests that it is caused by a combination of factors. These may include genetic disorders, infections, or medicines taken during pregnancy, and an older age of one or both parents (35 or older for women, 40 or over for men).
Research also clearly shows that there is no link between childhood vaccines and autism spectrum disorder.
If you have questions about ASD risk factors and causes, talk to your child's health care provider.

bacteria culture test,"What is a bacteria culture test?Bacteria are a large group of one-celled organisms. They can live on different places in the body. Some types of bacteria are harmless or even beneficial. Others can cause infections and disease. A bacteria culture test can help find harmful bacteria in your body. During a bacteria culture test, a sample will be taken from your blood, urine, skin, or other part of your body. The type of sample depends on the location of the suspected infection. The cells in your sample will be taken to a lab and put in a special environment in a lab to encourage cell growth. Results are often available within a few days. But some types of bacteria grow slowly, and it may take several days or longer.
","What is it used for?Bacteria culture tests are used to help diagnose certain types of infections. The most common types of bacteria tests and their uses are listed below.Throat CultureUsed to diagnose or rule out strep throatTest procedure:Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.Urine CultureUsed to diagnose a urinary tract infection and identify the bacteria causing the infectionTest procedure:You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.Sputum CultureSputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva.Used to help diagnose bacterial infections in the respiratory tract. These include bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis.Test procedure:You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special cup as instructed by your provider; or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.Blood CultureUsed to detect the presence of bacteria or fungi in the bloodTest procedure:A health care professional will need a blood sample. The sample is most often taken from a vein in your arm.Stool CultureAnother name for stool is feces.Used to detect infections caused by bacteria or parasites in the digestive system. These include food poisoning and other digestive illnesses.Test procedure:You will provide a sample of your feces in a clean container as instructed by your health care provider.Wound CultureUsed to detect infections on open wounds or on burn injuriesTest procedure:Your health care provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.
","Why do I need a bacteria culture test?Your health care provider may order a bacteria culture test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. The symptoms vary depending on the type of infection.
",,"Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?There are many different types of bacteria culture tests. Ask your health care provider if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having a swab or blood test or to providing a urine or stool sample.
","What do the results mean?If enough bacteria is found in your sample, it likely means you have a bacterial infection. Your health care provider may order additional tests to confirm a diagnosis or determine the severity of the infection. Your provider may also order a ""susceptibility test"" on your sample. A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I should know about a bacteria culture?
If your results show you don’t have a bacterial infection, you should not take antibiotics. Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections. Taking antibiotics when you don’t need them won’t help you feel better and may lead a serious problem known as antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance allows harmful bacteria to change in a way makes antibiotics less effective or not effective at all. This can be dangerous to you and to the community at large, as this bacteria can be spread to others.

bacterial vaginosis test,"What is a bacterial vaginosis (BV) test?Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection of the vagina. A healthy vagina contains a balance of both ""good"" (healthy) and ""bad"" (unhealthy) bacteria. Normally, the good type of bacteria keeps the bad type under control. A BV infection happens when the normal balance is upset and more bad bacteria grow than good bacteria.Most BV infections are mild and sometimes go away on their own. Some women get BV and recover without even knowing they were infected. But BV infections can be more serious and may not clear up without treatment. Untreated BV may increase your risk of getting a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or HIV.If you are pregnant and have a BV infection, it can increase your risk of having a premature (early) delivery or having a baby with a lower than normal birth weight (less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces at birth). Low birth weight can cause serious health problems in a baby, including infections, breathing difficulties, and troubles with feeding and gaining weight.A BV test can help you get diagnosed and treated so you can avoid these serious health problems.Other names: vaginal pH test, KOH test, wet mount test
","What is it used for?This test is used to diagnose BV infections.
","Why do I need a BV test?You may need testing if you have symptoms of BV. These include:A gray or white vaginal dischargeA strong, fish-like odor, which may be worse after sexPain and/or itching in the vaginaBurning sensation when urinating
","What happens during a BV test?A BV test is done in a similar way as a pelvic exam or Pap smear. During the test,You will take off your clothes below your waist. You will get a gown or sheet as a cover.You will lie on your back on an exam table, with your feet in stirrups.Your health care provider will insert a special tool called a speculum into your vagina. The speculum gently spreads apart the sides of your vagina.Your provider will use a cotton swab or wooden stick to collect a sample of your vaginal discharge.The discharge will be looked at under a microscope to check for signs of infection.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You should not use tampons, douche, or have sex for at least 24 hours before your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?You may feel some mild discomfort when the speculum is put in your vagina.
","What do the results mean?If your results show you have a BV infection, your health care provider will probably prescribe antibiotic pills and/or antibiotic creams or gels that you can put directly into your vagina.Sometimes a BV infection will come back after successful treatment. If this happens, your provider may prescribe different medicine or a different dose of the medicine you took before.If you are diagnosed with BV and are pregnant, it's important to treat the infection, because it can cause health problems for your unborn baby. Your health care provider will prescribe an antibiotic treatment that will be safe to take during pregnancy.If your results show no BV bacteria, your health care provider may do more tests to find out the cause of your symptoms.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BV test?BV is not spread through female-to-male sexual contact. So if you are diagnosed with BV and have a male sexual partner, he will not need to be tested. But the infection can be spread between female sexual partners. If you have an infection and your partner is female, she should get a BV test.Researchers aren't sure what causes BV, but there are steps you can take that may lower your risk of infection. These include:Don't use douchesLimit your number of sex partnersPractice safe sex
"
balance tests,"What are balance tests?Balance tests are a group of tests that check for balance disorders. A balance disorder is a condition that makes you feel unsteady on your feet and dizzy. Dizziness is a general term for different symptoms of imbalance. Dizziness can include vertigo, a feeling that you or your surroundings are spinning, and lightheadedness, a feeling like you are going to faint. Balance disorders can be mild, or so severe that you may have trouble walking, climbing stairs, or doing other normal activities.Different systems in your body need to work together for you to have good balance. The most important system is called the vestibular system. This system is located in your inner ear and includes special nerves and structures that help you keep your balance. Your vision and sense of touch are also essential for good balance. Problems with any of these systems can lead to a balance disorder.Balance disorders can happen at any age, but are more common in older people. It's one of the main reasons that older adults tend to fall more often than younger people.Other names: vestibular balance testing, vestibular testing
","What are they used for?
Balance tests are used to find out if you have a problem with your balance, and if so, what is causing it. There are many causes of balance disorders. They include:

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). Your inner ear contains calcium crystals, which help control balance. BPPV happens when these crystals get shifted out of position. It can make you feel like the room is spinning or your surroundings are moving. BPPV is the most common cause of vertigo in adults.
Meniere's disease. This disorder causes dizziness, bouts of hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
Vestibular neuritis. This refers to an inflammation inside the inner ear. It is usually caused by a virus. Symptoms include nausea and vertigo.
Migraines. A migraine is a type of throbbing, severe headache. It is different than other types of headaches. It can cause nausea and dizziness.
Head injury. You may get vertigo or other balance symptoms after a head injury.
Medicine side effect. Dizziness can be a side effect of certain medicines.

Once you learn the cause of your balance disorder, you can take steps to help manage or treat your condition.
","Why do I need a balance test?You may need a balance test if you have symptoms of a balance disorder. Symptoms include:DizzinessFeeling like you are in motion or spinning, even when standing still (vertigo)Loss of balance while walkingStaggering while walkingRinging in the ears (tinnitus)Feeling like you are going to faint (lightheadedness) and/or a floating sensationBlurred vision or double visionConfusion
","What happens during a balance test?Balance testing may be done by a primary health care provider or a specialist in disorders of the ear. These include:An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing loss.An otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat.Diagnosing balance disorders usually requires several tests. You may get one or more of the following tests:Electronystagmography (ENG) and videonystagmography (VNG) tests. These tests record and measure your eye movements. Your vision system needs to work right for you to have good balance. During the test:You will sit in an exam chair in a dark room.You will be asked to look at and follow patterns of light on a screen.You will be asked to move into different positions as you watch this light pattern.Then warm and cool water or air will be put in each ear. This should cause the eyes to move in specific ways. If the eyes don't respond in these ways, it may mean there is damage to the nerves of the inner ear.Rotary test, also known as a rotary chair test. This test also measures your eye movements. During this test:You will sit in a computer-controlled, motorized chair.You will put on special goggles that will record your eye movements as the chair slowly moves back and forth and in a circle.Posturography, also known as computerized dynamic posturography (CDP). This test measures your ability to maintain balance while standing. During this test:You will stand barefoot on a platform, wearing a safety harness.There will be a landscape screen around you.The platform will move around to test your ability to remain standing on a moving surface.Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) test. This test measures how certain muscles respond in reaction to sound. It can show if there is a problem in your inner ear. During this test:You will recline in a chair.You will put on earphones.Sensor pads will be attached to your neck, forehead, and under your eyes. These pads will record your muscle movements.Clicks and/or bursts of tones will be sent to your earphones.While the sound is playing, you'll be asked to lift your head or eyes for short periods of time.Dix hallpike maneuver. This test measures how your eye reacts to abrupt movements. During this test:Your provider will move you quickly from sitting to lying down position and/or move your head in different positions.Your provider will check your eye movements to see if you have a false sense of motion or spinning.A newer version of this test is called a video head impulse test (vHIT). During a vHIT test, you'll wear goggles that record your eye movements while a provider gently turns your head in different positions.You may also get one or more hearing tests, since many balance disorders are related to hearing problems.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a balance test?You should wear loose, comfortable clothes. Depending on the test, you may need to make changes in your diet or avoid certain medicines for a day or two before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to balance tests?Certain tests may make you feel dizzy or nauseous. But these feelings usually go away within a few minutes. You may want to make arrangements for someone to drive you home, in case the dizziness lasts for a longer period of time.
","What do the results mean?If your results were not normal, your provider may order more tests and/or put you on a treatment plan. Depending on the cause of your balance disorder, your treatment may include:Medicine to treat an infection.Medicine to help control dizziness and nausea.Positioning procedure. If you were diagnosed with BPPV, your provider may perform a series of specialized movements of your head and chest. This can help reposition particles in your inner ear that have gotten out of place. The procedure is also known as the Epley maneuver, or canalith repositioning.Balance retraining therapy, also known as vestibular rehabilitation. A provider specializing in balance rehabilitation may design a program of exercises and other steps to improve your balance and prevent falls. This may include learning to use a cane or a walker.Diet and lifestyle changes. If you were diagnosed with Meniere's disease or migraine headaches, certain lifestyle changes may ease your symptoms. These can include increasing physical activity, avoiding certain foods, and quitting smoking. Ask your health care provider about which changes may be best for you.Surgery. If medicines or other treatments are not working, you may need surgery to correct a problem in your inner ear. The type of surgery will depend on the specific cause of your balance disorder.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

barium swallow,"What is a barium swallow?
A barium swallow, also called an esophagogram, is an imaging test that checks for problems in your upper GI tract. Your upper GI tract includes your mouth, back of the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part of your small intestine. The test uses a special type of x-ray called fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy shows internal organs moving in real time. The test also involves drinking a chalky-tasting liquid that contains barium. Barium is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray.
Other names: esophagogram, esophagram, upper GI series, swallowing study
","What is it used for?
A barium swallow is used to help diagnose conditions that affect the throat, esophagus, stomach, and first part the small intestine. These include:

Ulcers
Hiatal hernia, a condition in which part of your stomach pushes into the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle between your stomach and chest.
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), a condition in which contents of the stomach leak backward into the esophagus
Structural problems in the GI tract, such as polyps (abnormal growths) and diverticula (pouches in the intestinal wall)
Tumors

","Why do I need a barium swallow?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of an upper GI disorder. These include:

Trouble swallowing
Abdominal pain
Vomiting
Bloating

","What happens during a barium swallow?
A barium swallow is most often done by a radiologist or radiology technician. A radiologist is a doctor who specializes in using imaging tests to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
A barium swallow usually includes the following steps:

You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.
You will be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area. This protects the area from unnecessary radiation.
You will stand, sit, or lie down on an x-ray table. You may be asked to change positions during the test.
You will swallow a drink that contains barium. The drink is thick and chalky. It's usually flavored with chocolate or strawberry to make it easier to swallow.
While you swallow, the radiologist will watch images of the barium traveling down your throat to your upper GI tract.
You may be asked to hold your breath at certain times.
The images will be recorded so they can be reviewed at a later time.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You will probably be asked to fast (not eat or drink) after midnight on the night before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
You should not have this test if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby.
For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation is very low and not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.
","What do the results mean?
A normal result means that no abnormalities in size, shape, and movement were found in your throat, esophagus, stomach, or first part of the small intestine.
If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Hiatal hernia
Ulcers
Tumors
Polyps
Diverticula, a condition in which small sacs form in the inner wall of the intestine
Esophageal stricture, a narrowing of the esophagus that can make it hard to swallow

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a barium swallow?
Your results may also show signs of esophageal cancer. If your provider thinks you may have this type of cancer, he or she may do a procedure called an esophagoscopy. During an esophagoscopy, a thin, flexible tube is inserted through the mouth or nose and down into the esophagus. The tube has a video camera so a provider can view the area. The tube may also have a tool attached that can be used to remove tissue samples for testing (biopsy).
"
basic metabolic panel (bmp),"What is a basic metabolic panel (BMP)?
A basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a test that measures eight different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A BMP includes tests for the following:

Glucose, a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy.
Calcium, one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart.
Sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, and chloride. These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body.
BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys.

Abnormal levels of any of these substances or combination of them can be a sign of a serious health problem.
Other names: chemistry panel, chemistry screen, chem 7, electrolyte panel
","What is it used for?
A BMP is used to check different body functions and processes, including:

Kidney function
Fluid and electrolyte balance
Blood sugar levels
Acid and base balance
Metabolism

","Why do I need a BMP?
A BMP is often done as part of a regular checkup. You may also need this test if you:

Are being treated in the emergency room
Are being monitored for certain chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease

","What happens during a BMP?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If any one result or combination of BMP results were not normal, it can indicate a number of different conditions. These include kidney disease, breathing problems, and complications related to diabetes. You will likely need more tests to confirm or rule out a specific diagnosis.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BMP?
There is a similar test to a BMP called a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A CMP includes the same eight tests as a BMP, plus six more tests, which measure certain proteins and liver enzymes. The additional tests are:

Albumin, a protein made in the liver
Total protein, which measures the total amount of protein in the blood
ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are different enzymes made by the liver.
Bilirubin, a waste product made by the liver

Your provider may order a CMP instead of a BMP to get a more complete picture of the health of your organs or to check for liver disease or other specific conditions.

bcr abl genetic test,"What is a BCR-ABL genetic test?A BCR-ABL genetic test looks for a genetic mutation (change) on a specific chromosome.Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color.People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell. One of each pair of chromosomes comes from your mother, and the other pair comes from your father.BCR-ABL is a mutation that is formed by the combination of two genes, known as BCR and ABL. It's sometimes called a fusion gene.The BCR gene is normally on chromosome number 22.The ABL gene is normally on chromosome number 9.The BCR-ABL mutation happens when pieces of BCR and ABL genes break off and switch places.The mutation shows up on chromosome 22, where the piece of chromosome 9 has attached itself.The mutated chromosome 22 is called the Philadelphia chromosome because that's the city where researchers first discovered it.The BCR-ABL gene is not the type of mutation that is inherited from your parents. It is a type of somatic mutation, which means you are not born with it. You get it later in life.The BCR-ABL gene shows up in patients with certain types of leukemia, a cancer of the bone marrow and white blood cells. BCR-ABL is found in almost all patients with a type of leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Another name for CML is chronic myelogenous leukemia. Both names refer to the same disease.The BCR-ABL gene is also found in some patients with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and rarely in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).Certain cancer medicines are especially effective in treating leukemia patients with the BCR-ABL gene mutation. These medicines also have fewer side effects than other cancer treatments. The same medicines are not effective in treating different types of leukemia or other cancers.Other names: BCR-ABL1, BCR-ABL1 fusion, Philadelphia chromosome
","What is it used for?A BCR-ABL test is most often used to diagnose or rule out chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or a specific form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) called Ph-positive ALL. Ph-positive means a Philadelphia chromosome was found. The test is not used to diagnose other types of leukemia.The test may also be used to:See if cancer treatment is effective.See if a patient has developed a resistance to certain treatment. That means a treatment that used to be effective is no longer working.
","Why do I need a BCR-ABL genetic test?You may need a BCR-ABL test if you have symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These include:FatigueFeverWeight lossNight sweats (excessive sweating while sleeping)Joint or bone painSome people with CML or Ph-positive ALL have no symptoms, or very mild symptoms, especially in the early stages of the disease. So your health care provider may order this test if a complete blood count or other blood test showed results that were not normal. You should also let your provider know if you have any symptoms that concern you. CML and Ph-positive ALL are easier to treat when found early.You may also need this test if you are currently being treated for CML or Ph-positive ALL. The test can help your provider see if your treatment is working.
","What happens during a BCR-ABL genetic test?A BCR-ABL test is usually a blood test or a procedure called a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.If you are getting a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.If you are getting a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, your procedure may include the following steps:You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for testing. Most bone marrow tests are taken from the hip bone.Your body will be covered with cloth, so that only the area around the testing site is showing.The site will be cleaned with an antiseptic.You will get an injection of a numbing solution. It may sting.Once the area is numb, the health care provider will take the sample. You will need to lie very still during the tests.For a bone marrow aspiration, which is usually performed first, the health care provider will insert a needle through the bone and pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a sharp but brief pain when the needle is inserted.For a bone marrow biopsy, the health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken.It takes about 10 minutes to perform both tests.After the test, the health care provider will cover the site with a bandage.Plan to have someone drive you home, since you may be given a sedative before the tests, which may make you drowsy.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood or bone marrow test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.After a bone marrow test, you may feel stiff or sore at the injection site. This usually goes away in a few days. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help.
","What do the results mean?If your results show you have the BCR-ABL gene, as well as an abnormal amount of white blood cells, you will probably be diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).If you are currently being treated for CML or Ph-positive ALL, your results may show:The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow is increasing. This may mean your treatment is not working and/or you've become resistant to a certain treatment.The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow is decreasing. This may mean your treatment is working.The amount of BCR-ABL in your blood or bone marrow has not increased or decreased. This may mean your disease is stable.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BCR-ABL genetic test?Treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph-positive, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have been successful in patients with these forms of leukemia.

beta 2 microglobulin (b2m) tumor marker test,"What is a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?This test measures the amount of a protein called beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) in the blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). B2M is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.B2M is found on the surface of many cells and is released into the body. Healthy people have small amounts of B2M in their blood and urine.People with cancers of the bone marrow and blood often have high levels of B2M in their blood or urine. These cancers include multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and leukemia.High levels of B2M in cerebrospinal fluid can mean that cancer has spread to the brain and/or spinal cord.A B2M tumor marker test is not used to diagnose cancer. But it can provide important information about your cancer, including how serious it is and how it may develop in the future.Other names: total beta-2 microglobulin, β2-microglobulin, B2M
","What is it used for?A beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test is most often given to people who have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the bone marrow or blood. The test may be used to:Figure out the severity of cancer and whether it has spread. This process is known as cancer staging. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer is.Predict disease development and guide treatment.See if cancer treatment is effective.See if cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord.
","Why do I need a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?You may need this test if you have been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or leukemia. The test can show the stage of your cancer and whether your cancer treatment is working.
","What happens during a beta-2 microglobulin tumor marker test?A beta-2 microglobulin test is usually a blood test, but may also be given as a 24-hour urine test, or as a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For a 24-hour urine sample, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test usually includes the following steps:Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.For the next 24 hours, save all your urine in the container provided.Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.For a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, a sample of spinal fluid will be collected in a procedure called a spinal tap (also known as a lumbar puncture).

bilirubin blood test,"What is a bilirubin blood test?A bilirubin blood test measures the levels of bilirubin in your blood. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance made during the body's normal process of breaking down red blood cells. Bilirubin is found in bile, a fluid in your liver that helps you digest food. If your liver is healthy, it will remove most of the bilirubin from your body. If your liver is damaged, bilirubin can leak out of your liver and into your blood. When too much bilirubin gets into the bloodstream, it can cause jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow. Signs of jaundice, along with a bilirubin blood test, can help your health care provider find out if you have liver disease.Other names: Total serum bilirubin, TSB
","What is it used for?A bilirubin blood test is used to check the health of your liver. The test is also commonly used to help diagnose newborn jaundice. Many healthy babies get jaundice because their livers aren't mature enough to get rid of enough bilirubin. Newborn jaundice is usually harmless and clears up within a few weeks. But in some cases, high bilirubin levels can lead to brain damage, so infants are often tested as a precaution.

blood alcohol level,"What is a blood alcohol test?
A blood alcohol test measures the level of Alcohol in your blood. Most people are more familiar with the breathalyzer, a test often used by police officers on people suspected of drunk driving.  While a breathalyzer gives fast results, it is not as accurate as measuring alcohol in the blood.
Alcohol, also known as ethanol, is the main ingredient of alcoholic drinks such as beer, wine, and liquor. When you have an alcoholic drink, it is absorbed into your bloodstream and processed by the liver. Your liver can process about one drink an hour. One drink is usually defined as 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of whiskey.
If you are drinking faster than your liver can process the alcohol, you may feel the effects of drunkenness, also called intoxication. These include behavioral changes and impaired judgment. The effects of alcohol can vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors such as age, weight, gender, and how much food you ate before drinking.
Other names: blood alcohol level test, ethanol test, ethyl alcohol, blood alcohol content

","What is it used for?

Are legally drunk. The legal alcohol limit for drinking in public varies from state to state.
Have been drinking while in a treatment program that prohibits drinking.
Have alcohol poisoning, a life-threatening condition that happens when your blood alcohol level gets very high. Alcohol poisoning can seriously affect basic body functions, including breathing, heart rate, and temperature.

Teens and young adults are at higher risk for binge drinking, which can cause alcohol poisoning. Binge drinking is a pattern of drinking that raises the blood alcohol level within a short period of time. Though it varies from person to person, binge drinking is usually defined as four drinks for women and five drinks for men in a two-hour period.
Young children may get alcohol poisoning from drinking household products that contain alcohol, such as mouthwash, hand sanitizer, and certain cold medicines.

","Why do I need a blood alcohol test?
You may need a blood alcohol test if you are suspected of drunk driving and/or have symptoms of intoxication. These include:

Difficulty with balance and coordination

blood differential,"What is a blood differential test?A blood differential test measures the amount of each type of white blood cell (WBC) that you have in your body. White blood cells (leukocytes) are part of your immune system, a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect you from infection. There are five different types of white blood cells:Neutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell. These cells travel to the site of an infection and release substances called enzymes to fight off invading viruses or bacteria.Lymphocytes. There are two main types of lymphocytes: B cells and T cells. B cells fight off invading viruses, bacteria, or toxins. T cells target and destroy the body's own cells that have been infected by viruses or cancer cells.Monocytes remove foreign material, remove dead cells, and boost the body's immune response.Eosinophils fight infection, inflammation, and allergic reactions. They also defend the body against parasites and bacteria.Basophils release enzymes to help control allergic reactions and asthma attacks.However, your test results may have more than five numbers. For example, the lab may list the results as counts as well as percentages.Other names for a blood differential test: Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, Differential, White blood cell differential count, Leukocyte differential count

"
blood oxygen level,"What is a blood oxygen level test?
A blood oxygen level test, also known as a blood gas analysis, measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. When you breathe, your lungs take in (inhale) oxygen and breathe out (exhale) carbon dioxide. If there is an imbalance in the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood, it can mean your lungs aren't working well.
A blood oxygen level test also checks the balance of acids and bases, known as pH balance, in the blood. Too much or too little acid in the blood can mean there is a problem with your lungs or kidneys.
Other names: blood gas test, arterial blood gases, ABG, blood gas analysis, oxygen saturation test

","What is it used for?
A blood oxygen level test is used to check how well your lungs are working and measure the acid-base balance in your blood. The test usually includes the following measurements:

Oxygen content (O2CT). This measures the amount of oxygen in the blood.
Oxygen saturation (O2Sat). This measures the amount of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.
Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). This measures the pressure of oxygen dissolved in the blood. It helps show how well oxygen moves  from your lungs to your bloodstream.
Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2). This measures the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood.
pH. This measures the balance of acids and bases in the blood.


","Why do I need a blood oxygen level test?
There are many reasons this test is ordered. You may need a blood oxygen level test if you:

Have trouble breathing
Have frequent periods of nausea and/or vomiting
Are being treated for a lung disease, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or cystic fibrosis. The test can help to see if treatment is working.
Recently injured your head or neck, which can affect your breathing
Had a drug overdose
Are receiving oxygen therapy while in the hospital. The test can help make sure you are getting the right amount of oxygen.
Have carbon monoxide poisoning
Have a smoke inhalation injury

A newborn baby may also need this test if he or she is having trouble breathing.

","What happens during a blood oxygen level test?
Most blood tests take a sample from a vein. For this test, a health care provider will take a sample of blood from an artery. That's because blood from an artery has higher oxygen levels than blood from a vein. The sample is usually taken from an artery inside the wrist. This is called the radial artery. Sometimes the sample is taken from an artery in the elbow or the groin. If a newborn is being tested, the sample may be taken from the baby's heel or umbilical cord.
During the procedure, your provider will insert a needle with a syringe into the artery. You may feel a sharp pain as the needle goes into the artery. Getting a blood sample from an artery is usually more painful than getting blood from a vein, a more common type of blood test procedure.
Once the syringe is filled with blood, your provider will put a bandage over the puncture site.  After the procedure, you or a provider will need to apply firm pressure to the site for 5–10 minutes, or even longer if you are taking a blood-thinning medicine.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
If your blood sample is taken from your wrist, your health care provider may perform a circulation test called an Allen test before taking the sample. In an Allen test, your provider will apply pressure to the arteries in your wrist for several seconds.
If you are on oxygen therapy, your oxygen may be turned off for about 20 minutes before the test. This is called a room air test. This won't be done if you are unable breathe without the oxygen.

","Are there any risks to the test? 
There is very little risk to having a blood oxygen level test. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Though problems are rare, you should avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.

","What do the results mean?
If your blood oxygen level results are not normal, it may mean you:

Are not taking in enough oxygen
Are not getting rid of enough carbon dioxide
Have an imbalance in your acid-base levels

These conditions can be signs of a lung or kidney disease. The test can't diagnose specific diseases, but if your results are not normal, your health care provider will order more tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about blood oxygen level tests?
Another type of test, called pulse oximetry, also checks blood oxygen levels. This test doesn't use a needle or require a blood sample. In pulse oximetry, a small clip-like device with a special sensor is attached to your fingertip, toe, or earlobe. Since the device measures oxygen ""peripherally""(in an outer area), the results are given as peripheral oxygen saturation, also known as SpO2.
"
blood smear,"What is a blood smear?
A blood smear is a sample of blood that's tested on a specially treated slide. For a blood smear test, a laboratory professional examines the slide under a microscope and looks at the size, shape, and number of different types of blood cells. These include:

Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body
White blood cells, which fight infection
Platelets, which help your blood to clot

Many blood tests use computers to analyze results. For a blood smear, the lab professional looks for blood cell problems that may not be seen on a computer analysis.
Other names: peripheral smear, peripheral blood film, smear, blood film, manual differential, differential slide, blood cell morphology, blood smear analysis

A bone density scan, also known as a DEXA scan, is a type of low-dose x-ray test that measures calcium and other minerals in your bones. The measurement helps show the strength and thickness (known as bone density or mass) of your bones.
Most people's bones become thinner as they get older. When bones become thinner than normal, it's known as osteopenia. Osteopenia puts you at risk for a more serious condition called osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a progressive disease that causes bones to become very thin and brittle. Osteoporosis usually affects older people and is most common in women over the age of 65. People with osteoporosis are at higher risk for fractures (broken bones), especially in their hips, spine, and wrists.
Other names: bone mineral density test, BMD test, DEXA scan, DXA; Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry

Have had one or more fractures after the age of 50
Have lost a half inch or more in height within one year
Are a man over the age of 70
Have a family history of osteoporosis

Other risk factors include:

Lack of physical activity
Smoking cigarettes
Heavy drinking
Not getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet

","What happens during a bone density scan?
There are different ways to measure bone density. The most common and accurate way uses a procedure called dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, also known as a DEXA scan. The scan is usually done in a radiologist's office.
During a DEXA scan:

You will lie on your back on a padded table. You will probably be able to leave your clothes on.
You may need to lie with your legs straight, or you may be asked to rest your legs on a padded platform.
A scanning machine will pass over your lower spine and hip. At the same time, another scanning machine called a photon generator will pass beneath you. The images from the two machines will be combined and sent to a computer. A health care provider will view the images on the computer screen.
While the machines are scanning, you will need to stay very still. You may be asked to hold your breath.

To measure bone density in the forearm, finger, hand, or foot, a provider may use a portable scanner known as a peripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) scan.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may be told to stop taking calcium supplements 24 to 48 hours before your test. Also, you should avoid wearing metal jewelry or clothes with metal parts, such as buttons or buckles.
","Are there any risks to the test?
A bone density scan uses very low doses of radiation. It is safe for most people. But it is not recommended for pregnant woman. Even low doses of radiation could harm an unborn baby. Be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.
","What do the results mean?
Bone density results are often given in the form of a T score. A T score is a measurement that compares your bone density measurement with the bone density of a healthy 30-year-old. A low T score means you probably have some bone loss.
Your results may show one of the following:

A T score of -1.0 or higher. This is considered normal bone density.
A T score between -1.0 and -2.5. This means you have low bone density (osteopenia) and may be at risk for developing osteoporosis.
A T score of -2.5 or less. This means you probably have osteoporosis.

If your results show you have low bone density, your health care provider will recommend steps to prevent further bone loss. These may include:

Getting more exercise, with activities such walking, dancing, and using weight machines.
Adding calcium and vitamin D to your diet
Taking prescription medicines to increase bone density

If you have questions about your results and/or treatments for bone loss, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a bone density scan?
A DEXA scan is the most common way to measure bone density. But your health care provider may order more tests to confirm a diagnosis or to find out if bone loss treatment is working. These include a calcium blood test, a vitamin D test, and/or tests for certain hormones.

bone marrow tests,"What are bone marrow tests?Bone marrow is a soft, spongy tissue found in the center of most bones. Bone marrow makes different types of blood cells. These include:Red blood cells (also called erythrocytes), which carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your bodyWhite blood cells (also called leukocytes), which help you fight infectionsPlatelets, which help with blood clotting.Bone marrow tests check to see if your bone marrow is working correctly and making normal amounts of blood cells. The tests can help diagnose and monitor various bone marrow disorders, blood disorders, and certain types of cancer. There are two types of bone marrow tests:Bone marrow aspiration, which removes a small amount of bone marrow fluidBone marrow biopsy, which removes a small amount of bone marrow tissueBone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy tests are usually performed at the same time.Other names: bone marrow examination
","What are they used for?Bone marrow tests are used to:Find out the cause of problems with red blood cells, white bloods, or plateletsDiagnose and monitor blood disorders, such as anemia, polycythemia vera, and thrombocytopeniaDiagnose bone marrow disordersDiagnose and monitor certain types of cancers, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphomaDiagnose infections that may have started or spread to the bone marrow
","Why do I need a bone marrow test?Your health care provider may order a bone marrow aspiration and a bone marrow biopsy if other blood tests show your levels of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are not normal. Too many or too few of these cells may mean you have a medical disorder, such as cancer that starts in your blood or bone marrow. If you are being treated for another type of cancer, these tests can find out if the cancer has spread to your bone marrow.
","What happens during a bone marrow test?Bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy tests are usually given at the same time. A doctor or other health care provider will perform the tests. Before the tests, the provider may ask you to put on a hospital gown. The provider will check your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. You may be given a mild sedative, a medicine that will help you relax. During the test:You'll lie down on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for testing. Most bone marrow tests are taken from the hip bone.Your body will be covered with cloth, so that only the area around the testing site is showing.The site will be cleaned with an antiseptic.You will get an injection of a numbing solution. It may sting.Once the area is numb, the health care provider will take the sample. You will need to lie very still during the tests.For a bone marrow aspiration, which is usually performed first, the health care provider will insert a needle through the bone and pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a sharp but brief pain when the needle is inserted.For a bone marrow biopsy, the health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken.It takes about 10 minutes to perform both tests.After the test, the health care provider will cover the site with a bandage.Plan to have someone drive you home, since you may be given a sedative before the tests, which may make you drowsy.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You will be asked to sign a form that gives permission to perform bone marrow tests. Be sure to ask your provider any questions you have about the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?Many people feel a little uncomfortable after bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy testing. After the test, you may feel stiff or sore at the injection site. This usually goes away in a few days. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe a pain reliever to help. Serious symptoms are very rare, but may include:Long-lasting pain or discomfort around the injection siteRedness, swelling, or excessive bleeding at the siteFeverIf you have any of these symptoms, call your health care provider.
","What do the results mean?It may take several days or even several weeks to get your bone marrow test results. The results may show whether you have a bone marrow disease, a blood disorder, or cancer. If you are being treated for cancer, the results may show:Whether your treatment is workingHow advanced your disease isIf your results are not normal, your health care provider will likely order more tests or discuss treatment options. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

braf genetic test,"What is a BRAF genetic test?A BRAF genetic test looks for a change, known as a mutation, in a gene called BRAF. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.The BRAF gene makes a protein that helps control cell growth. It's known as an oncogene. An oncogene works like a gas pedal on a car. Normally, an oncogene turns on cell growth as needed. But if you have a BRAF mutation, it's like the gas pedal is stuck down, and the gene can't stop cells from growing. Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.A BRAF mutation can be inherited from your parents or acquired later in life. Mutations that happen later in life are usually caused by the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division. Inherited BRAF mutations are very rare, but they can cause serious health problems.Acquired (also known as somatic) BRAF mutations are much more common. These mutations have been found in about half of all cases of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer. BRAF mutations are also often found in other disorders and different types of cancer, including cancers of the colon, thyroid, and ovaries. Cancers with a BRAF mutation tend to be more serious than those without the mutation.Other names: BRAF gene mutation analysis, Melanoma, BRAF V600 mutation, cobas
","What is it used for?The test is most often used to look for a BRAF mutation in patients with melanoma or other BRAF-related cancers. Certain cancer medicines are especially effective in people who have a BRAF mutation. The same medicines are not as effective and sometimes dangerous to people who don't have the mutation.BRAF testing may also be used to see if you are at risk for cancer based on family history and/or your own health history.
","Why do I need a BRAF genetic test?You may need BRAF testing if you've been diagnosed with melanoma or another type of cancer. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help your provider prescribe the right treatment.You may also need this test to see if you are at higher risk for getting cancer. Risk factors include a family history of cancer and/or having cancer at an early age. The specific age depends on the type of cancer.
","What happens during a BRAF genetic test?Most BRAF tests are done in a procedure called a tumor biopsy. During a biopsy, a health care provider will take out a small piece of tissue by cutting or scraping the surface of a tumor. If your provider needs to test tumor tissue from inside your body, he or she may use a special needle to withdraw the sample.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You usually don't need any special preparations for a BRAF test.
","Are there any risks to the test?You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.
","What do the results mean?If you have melanoma or other type of cancer, and the results show you have a BRAF mutation, your provider can prescribe medicines that are designed to target the mutation. These medicines can be more effective than other treatments.If you have melanoma or other type of cancer, and the results show you don't have a mutation, your provider will prescribe different types of medicines to treat your cancer.If you have not been diagnosed with cancer and your results show you have a BRAF genetic mutation, it does not mean you have cancer, but you have a higher risk of cancer. But more frequent cancer screenings, such as a skin exam, can reduce your risk. During a skin exam, a health care provider will carefully look over the skin on your whole body to check for moles and other suspicious growths.Talk to your provider about other steps you can take to reduce your risk.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BRAF test?You may hear your provider talk about a V600E mutation. There are different types of BRAF mutations. V600E is the most common type of BRAF mutation.
"
brca genetic test,"What is a BRCA genetic test?
A BRCA genetic test looks for changes, known as mutations, in genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determine your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Genes are also responsible for certain health conditions. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are genes that protect cells by making proteins that help prevent tumors from forming.
A mutation in a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene can cause cell damage that may lead to cancer.  Women with a mutated BRCA gene have a higher risk of getting breast or ovarian cancer. Men with a mutated BRCA gene are at a higher risk for getting breast or prostate cancer. Not everyone who inherits a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation will get cancer. Other factors, including your lifestyle and environment, can affect your cancer risk.
If you find out you have a BRCA mutation, you may be able to take steps to protect your health.
Other names: BRCA gene test, BRCA gene 1, BRCA gene 2, breast cancer susceptibility gene1, breast cancer susceptibility gene 2
","What is it used for?
This test is used to find out if you have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation. A BRCA gene mutation can increase your risk of getting cancer.

","Why do I need a BRCA genetic test?
BRCA testing is not recommended for most people. BRCA gene mutations are rare, affecting only about 0.2 percent of the U.S. population. But you may want this test if you think you are at a higher risk of having the mutation. You are more likely to have a BRCA mutation if you:

Have or had breast cancer that was diagnosed before age 50
Have or had breast cancer in both breasts
Have or had both breast and ovarian cancer
Have one or more family members with breast cancer
Have a male relative with breast cancer
Have a relative already diagnosed with a BRCA mutation
Are of Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. BRCA mutations are much more common in this group compared to the general population. BRCA mutations are also more common in people from other parts of Europe, including, Iceland, Norway, and Denmark.

","What happens during a BRCA genetic test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for BRCA testing. But you may want to meet with a genetic counselor first to see if the test is right for you. Your counselor may talk with you about the risks and benefits of genetic testing and what different results can mean.
You should also think about getting genetic counseling after your test. Your counselor can discuss how your results may impact you and your family, both medically and emotionally.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
Most results are described as negative, uncertain, or positive, and typically mean the following:

A negative result means no BRCA gene mutation was found, but it doesn't mean you won't ever get cancer.
An uncertain result means some kind of BRCA gene mutation was found, but it may or may not be linked with an increased cancer risk. You may need more tests and/or monitoring if your results were uncertain.
A positive result means a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was found. These mutations put you at a higher risk of getting cancer. But not everyone with the mutation gets cancer.

It may take several weeks to get your results. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider and/or your genetic counselor.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BRCA genetic test?
If your results show you have a BRCA gene mutation, you can take steps that may lower your risk of breast cancer. These include:

More frequent cancer screening tests, such as mammograms and ultrasounds. Cancer is easier to treat when it's found in the early stages.
Taking birth control pills for a limited time. Taking birth control pills for a maximum of five years has been shown to reduce the risk of ovarian cancer in some women with  BRCA gene mutations. Taking the pills for more than five years to reduce cancer is not recommended. If you were taking birth control pills before you took the BRCA test, tell your health care provider how old you were when you started taking the pills and for how long. He or she will then recommend whether or not you should continue taking them.
Taking cancer-fighting medicines. Certain drugs, such as one called tamoxifen, have been shown to reduce the risk in women with a higher risk of breast cancer.
Having surgery, known as a preventive mastectomy, to remove healthy breast tissue. Preventive mastectomy has been shown to reduce breast cancer risk by as much as 90 percent in women with a BRCA gene mutation. But this is a major operation, only recommended for women at very high risk for getting cancer.

You should talk with your health care provider to see what steps are best for you.
"
breast biopsy,"What is a breast biopsy?
A breast biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of breast tissue for testing. The tissue is looked at under a microscope to check for breast cancer. There are different ways to do a breast biopsy procedure. One method uses a special needle to remove tissue. Another method removes tissue in a minor, outpatient surgery.
A breast biopsy can determine whether you have breast cancer. But most women who have a breast biopsy do not have cancer.
Other names: core needle biopsy; core biopsy, breast; fine-needle aspiration; open surgery biopsy

","What is it used for?
A breast biopsy is used to confirm or rule out breast cancer. It is done after other breast tests, such as a mammogram, or a physical breast exam, show there might be a chance of breast cancer.

","Why do I need a breast biopsy?
You may need a breast biopsy if:

You or your health care provider felt a lump in your breast
Your mammogram, MRI, or ultrasound tests show a lump, shadow, or other area of concern
You have changes in your nipple, such as bloody discharge

If your health care provider has ordered a breast biopsy, it does not necessarily mean you have breast cancer. The majority of breast lumps that are tested are benign, which means noncancerous.

","What happens during a breast biopsy?
There are three main types of breast biopsy procedures:

Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluid
Core needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sample
Surgical biopsy, which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedure

Fine needle aspiration  and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps.

You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table.
A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.
Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid.
You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn.
Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops.
Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.

In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps.

You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand.
You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax.

You will be given local or general anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the procedure.
		
For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.
For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine, so you will be unconscious during the procedure.


the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed.
The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips.

The type of biopsy you have will depend on different factors, including the size of the lump and what the lump or area of concern looks like on a breast test.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site). If you are getting general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. Your surgeon will give you more specific instructions. Also, if you are getting a sedative or general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?
You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. Sometimes the site gets infected. If that happens, you will be treated with antibiotics. A surgical biopsy may cause some additional pain and discomfort. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe medicine to help you feel better.

","What do the results mean?
It may take several days to a week to get your results. Typical results may show:

Normal.  No cancer or abnormal cells were found.
Abnormal, but benign. These show breast changes that are not cancer. These include calcium deposits and cysts. Sometimes more testing and/or follow-up treatment may be needed.
Cancer cells found. Your results will include information about the cancer to help you and your health care provider develop a treatment plan that best meets your needs. You will probably be referred to a provider who specializes in breast cancer treatment.

Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a breast biopsy?
In the United States, tens of thousands of women and hundreds of men die of breast cancer every year. A breast biopsy, when appropriate, can help find breast cancer at an early stage, when it's most treatable. If breast cancer is found early, when it is confined to the breast only, the five-year survival rate is 99 percent. This means, on average, that 99 out of 100 people with breast cancer that was detected early are still alive 5 years after being diagnosed. If you have questions about breast cancer screening, such as mammograms or a breast biopsy, talk to your health care provider.
"
bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (bal),"What are bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)?
Bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look at your lungs. It uses a thin, lighted tube called a bronchoscope. The tube is put through the mouth or nose and moved down the throat and into the airways. It helps diagnose and treat certain lung diseases.
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a procedure that is sometimes done during a bronchoscopy. It is also called bronchoalveolar washing. BAL is used to collect a sample from the lungs for testing. During the procedure, a saline solution is put through the bronchoscope to wash the airways and capture a fluid sample.
Other names: flexible bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar washing
","What are they used for?
Bronchoscopy may be used to:

Find and treat growths or other blockages in the airways
Remove lung tumors
Control bleeding in the airway
Help find the cause of persistent cough

If you've already been diagnosed with lung cancer, the test can help show how severe it is.
Bronchoscopy with BAL is used to collect tissue for testing. These tests help diagnose different disorders of the lungs including:

Bacterial infections such as tuberculosis and bacterial pneumonia
Fungal infections
Lung cancer

One or both tests may be used if an imaging test showed a potential problem with the lungs.
","Why do I need bronchoscopy and BAL?
You may need one or both tests if you have symptoms of a lung disease, such as:

Persistent cough
Trouble breathing
Coughing up blood

You may also need a BAL if you have an immune system disorder. Some immune system disorders, such as HIV/AIDS, can put you at higher risk for certain lung infections.
","What happens during bronchoscopy and BAL?
Bronchoscopy and BAL are often done by a pulmonologist. A pulmonologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating lung diseases.
A bronchoscopy usually includes the following steps:

You may need to remove some or all of your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.
You will recline in a chair that is like a dentist's chair or sit on a procedure table with your head raised.
You may get medicine (sedative) to help you relax. The medicine will be injected into a vein or given through an IV (intravenous) line that will be placed in your arm or hand.
Your provider will spray a numbing medicine in your mouth and throat, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.
Your provider will insert the bronchoscope down your throat and into your airways.
As the bronchoscope is moved down, your provider will examine your lungs.
Your provider may perform other treatments at this time, such as removing a tumor or clearing a blockage.
At this point, you may also get a BAL.

During a BAL:

Your provider will put a small amount of saline through the bronchoscope.
After washing the airways, the saline is sucked up into the bronchoscope.
The saline solution will contain cells and other substances, such as bacteria, which will be taken to a lab for testing.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your procedure. Your provider will let you know how long you need to avoid food and drink.
You should also arrange to have someone drive you home. If you've been given a sedative, you may be drowsy for a few hours after your procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a bronchoscopy or a BAL. The procedures may give you a sore throat for a few days. Serious complications are rare, but they may include bleeding in the airways, infection, or a collapsed part of a lung.
","What do the results mean?
If your bronchoscopy results were not normal, it may mean you have a lung disorder such as:

A blockage, growth, or tumor in the airways
Narrowing of part of the airways
Lung damage due to an immune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis

If you had BAL and your lung sample results were not normal, it may mean you have lung cancer or a type of infection such as:

Tuberculosis
Bacterial pneumonia
Fungal infection

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about bronchoscopy and BAL?
In addition to BAL, there are other procedures that can be done during a bronchoscopy. These include:

Sputum culture. Sputum is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs. It is different than spit or saliva. A sputum culture checks for certain types of infections.
Laser therapy or radiation to treat tumors or cancer
Treatment to control bleeding in the lungs

"
bun (blood urea nitrogen),"What is a BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test?A BUN, or blood urea nitrogen test, can provide important information about your kidney function. The main job of your kidneys is to remove waste and extra fluid from your body. If you have kidney disease, this waste material can build up in your blood and may lead to serious health problems, including high blood pressure, anemia, and heart disease.The test measures the amount of urea nitrogen in your blood. Urea nitrogen is one of the waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys. Higher than normal BUN levels may be a sign that your kidneys aren't working efficiently.People with early kidney disease may not have any symptoms. A BUN test can help uncover kidney problems at an early stage when treatment can be more effective.Other names for a BUN test: Urea nitrogen test, serum BUN
","What is it used for?A BUN test is often part of a series of tests called a comprehensive metabolic panel, and can be used to help diagnose or monitor a kidney disease or disorder.
","Why do I need a BUN test?Your health care provider may order a BUN test as part of a routine check-up or if you have or are at risk for a kidney problem. Although early kidney disease usually does not have any signs or symptoms, certain factors can put you at a higher risk. These include:Family history of kidney problemsDiabetesHigh blood pressureHeart diseaseIn addition, your BUN levels may be checked if you are experiencing symptoms of later stage kidney disease, such as:Needing to go the bathroom (urinate) frequently or infrequentlyItchingRecurring fatigueSwelling in your arms, legs, or feetMuscle crampsTrouble sleeping
","What happens during a BUN test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a BUN test. If your health care provider has also ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Normal BUN levels can vary, but generally a high level of blood urea nitrogen is a sign that your kidneys are not working correctly. However, abnormal results don't always indicate that you have a medical condition needing treatment. Higher than normal BUN levels can also be caused by dehydration, burns, certain medicines, a high protein diet, or other factors, including your age. BUN levels normally increase as you get older. To learn what your results mean, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a BUN test?A BUN test is only one type of measurement of kidney function. If your health care provider suspects you have kidney disease, additional tests may be recommended. These may include a measurement of creatinine, which is another waste product filtered by your kidneys, and a test called a GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate), which estimates how well your kidneys are filtering blood.
"
ca-125 blood test (ovarian cancer),"What is a CA-125 blood test?
This test measures the amount of a protein called CA-125 (cancer antigen 125) in the blood. CA-125 levels are high in many women with ovarian cancer. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that store ova (eggs) and make female hormones. Ovarian cancer happens when there is uncontrolled cell growth in a woman's ovary. Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the U.S.
Because high CA-125 levels can be a sign of other conditions besides ovarian cancer, this test is not used to screen women at low risk for the disease. A CA-125 blood test is most often done on women already diagnosed with ovarian cancer. It can help find out if cancer treatment is working, or if your cancer has come back after you have finished treatment.
Other names: cancer antigen 125, glycoprotein antigen, ovarian cancer antigen, CA-125 tumor marker

","What is it used for?
A CA-125 blood test may be used to:

Monitor treatment for ovarian cancer. If CA-125 levels go down, it usually means the treatment is working.
Check to see if cancer has come back after successful treatment. 
Screen women who are at high risk for ovarian cancer.


","Why do I need a CA-125 blood test?
You may need a CA-125 blood test if you are currently being treated for ovarian cancer. Your health care provider may test you at regular intervals to see if your treatment is working, and after your treatment is finished.
You may also need this test if you have certain risk factors for ovarian cancer. You may be at a higher risk if you:

Have inherited a gene that puts you at higher risk of ovarian cancer. These genes are known as BRCA 1 and BRCA 2.
Have a family member with ovarian cancer.
Previously had cancer in the uterus, breast, or colon.


","What happens during a CA-125 blood test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a CA-125 blood test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
If you are being treated for ovarian cancer, you may be tested several times throughout your treatment. If testing shows your CA-125 levels have gone down, it usually means the cancer is responding to treatment. If your levels go up or stay the same, it may mean the cancer is not responding to treatment.
If you have finished your treatment for ovarian cancer, high CA-125 levels may mean your cancer has come back.
If you are not being treated for ovarian cancer and your results show high CA-125 levels, it can be a sign of cancer. But it may also be a sign of a noncancerous condition, such as:

Endometriosis, a condition in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus also grows outside the uterus. It can be very painful. It may also make it harder to get pregnant.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of a woman's reproductive organs. It's usually caused by a sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia.
Uterine fibroids, noncancerous growths in the uterus
Liver disease
Pregnancy
Menstruation, at certain times during your cycle

If you are not being treated for ovarian cancer, and your results show high CA-125 levels, your health care provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your results.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CA-125 blood test?
If your health care provider thinks you may have ovarian cancer, he or she may refer you to a gynecologic oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancers of the female reproductive system.

ca 19-9 blood test (pancreatic cancer),"What is a CA 19-9 blood test?This test measures the amount of a protein called CA 19-9 (cancer antigen 19-9) in the blood. CA 19-9 is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.Healthy people can have small amounts of CA 19-9 in their blood. High levels of CA 19-9 are often a sign of pancreatic cancer. But sometimes, high levels can indicate other types of cancer or certain noncancerous disorders, including cirrhosis and gallstones.Because high levels of CA 19-9 can mean different things, the test is not used by itself to screen for or diagnose cancer. It can help monitor the progress of your cancer and the effectiveness of cancer treatment.Other names: cancer antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 19-9
","What is it used for?A CA 19-9 blood test may be used to:Monitor pancreatic cancer and cancer treatment. CA 19-9 levels often go up as cancer spreads, and go down as tumors shrink.See if cancer has returned after treatment.The test is sometimes used with other tests to help confirm or rule out cancer.
","Why do I need a CA 19-9 test?You may need a CA 19-9 blood test if you've been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or other type of cancer related to high levels of CA 19-9. These cancers include bile duct cancer, colon cancer, and stomach cancer.Your health care provider may test you on a regular basis to see if your cancer treatment is working. You may also be tested after your treatment is complete to see if the cancer has come back.
","What happens during a CA 19-9 blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a CA 19-9 blood test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If you are being treated for pancreatic cancer or other type of cancer, you may be tested several times throughout your treatment. After repeated tests, your results may show:Your levels of CA 19-9 are increasing. This may mean your tumor is growing, and/or your treatment is not working.Your levels of CA 19-9 are decreasing. This may mean your tumor is shrinking and your treatment is working.Your levels of CA 19-9 have not increased or decreased. This may mean your disease is stable.Your CA 19-9 levels decreased, but then later increased. This may mean your cancer has come back after you've been treated.If you do not have cancer and your results show a higher than normal level of CA 19-9, it may be a sign of one of the following noncancerous disorders:Pancreatitis, a noncancerous swelling of the pancreasGallstonesBile duct blockageLiver diseaseCystic fibrosisIf your health care provider suspects you have one of these disorders, he or she will probably order more tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your results.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CA 19-9 test?

"
calcitonin test,"What is a calcitonin test?
This test measures the level of calcitonin in your blood. Calcitonin is a hormone made by your thyroid, a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. Calcitonin helps control how the body uses calcium. Calcitonin is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.
If too much calcitonin is found in the blood, it may be a sign of a type of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). High levels may also be a sign of other thyroid diseases that can put you at a higher risk for getting MTC. These include:

C-cell hyperplasia, a condition that causes abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2), a rare, inherited disease that causes the growth of tumors in the thyroid and other glands in the endocrine system. The endocrine system is a group of glands that control a variety of important functions, including how your body uses and burns energy (metabolism).

Other names: thyrocalcitonin, CT, human calcitonin, hCT
","What is it used for?A calcitonin test is most often used to:Help diagnose C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancerFind out if treatment for medullary thyroid cancer is workingFind out if medullary thyroid cancer has returned after treatmentScreen people with a family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). A family history of this disease can put you at a higher risk for developing medullary thyroid cancer.

You need calcium for healthy bones and teeth. Calcium is also essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart. Almost all of your body's calcium is stored in your bones. A small amount circulates in the blood, and the remainder is filtered by the kidneys and passed into your urine. If urine calcium levels are too high or too low, it may mean you have a medical condition, such as kidney disease or kidney stones. Kidney stones are hard, pebble-like substances that can form in one or both kidneys when calcium or other minerals build up in the urine. Most kidney stones are formed from calcium.Too much or too little calcium in the blood can also indicate a kidney disorder, as well as certain bone diseases, and other medical problems. So if you have symptoms of one of these disorders, your health care provider may order a calcium blood test, along with a calcium in urine test. In addition, a calcium blood test is often included as part of a regular check-up.Other names: urinalysis (calcium)

carbon dioxide (co2) in blood,"What is a carbon dioxide (CO2) blood test?Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an odorless, colorless gas. It is a waste product made by your body. Your blood carries carbon dioxide to your lungs. You breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen all day, every day, without thinking about it. A CO2 blood test measures the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood. Too much or too little carbon dioxide in the blood can indicate a health problem.Other names: carbon dioxide content, CO2 content, carbon dioxide blood test, bicarbonate blood test, bicarbonate test, total CO2; TCO2; carbon dioxide content; CO2 content; bicarb; HCO3
","What is it used for?A CO2 blood test is often part of a series of tests called an electrolyte panel. Electrolytes help balance the levels of acids and bases in your body. Most of the carbon dioxide in your body is in the form of bicarbonate, which is a type of electrolyte. An electrolyte panel may part of a regular exam. The test may also help monitor or diagnose conditions related to an electrolyte imbalance. These include kidney diseases, lung diseases, and high blood pressure.

"
catecholamine tests,"What are catecholamine tests?
Catecholamines are hormones made by your adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. These hormones are released into the body in response to physical or emotional stress. The main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Epinephrine is also known as adrenaline. Catecholamine tests measure the amount of these hormones in your urine or blood. Higher than normal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and/or epinephrine can be a sign of a serious health condition.
Other names: dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine tests, free catecholamines
","What are they used for?
Catecholamine tests are most often used to diagnose or rule out certain types of rare tumors, including:

Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal glands. This type of tumor is usually benign (not cancerous). But it can be fatal if left untreated.
Neuroblastoma, a cancerous tumor that develops from nerve tissue. It mostly affects infants and children.
Paraganglioma, a type of tumor that forms near the adrenal glands. This type of tumor is sometimes cancerous, but usually grows very slowly.

The tests may also be used to see if treatments for these tumors are working.
","Why do I need a catecholamine test?
You or your child may need this test if you have symptoms of a tumor that affect catecholamine levels. Symptoms in adults include:

High blood pressure, especially if it is not responding to treatment
Severe headaches
Sweating
Rapid heartbeat

Symptoms in children include:

Bone pain or tenderness
An abnormal lump in the abdomen
Weight loss
Uncontrolled eye movements

","What happens during a catecholamine test?
A catecholamine test may be done in urine or blood. Urine testing is done more often because catecholamine blood levels can change quickly and may also be affected by the stress of testing.
But blood testing can be useful in helping to diagnose a pheochromocytoma tumor. If you have this tumor, certain substances will be released into the bloodstream.
For a catecholamine urine test, your health care provider will ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For 24-hour urine sample test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. Test instructions usually include the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.
For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.
Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.
Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

"
ccp antibody test,"What is a CCP antibody test?
This test looks for CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide) antibodies in the blood. CCP antibodies, also called anti-CCP antibodies, are a type of antibody called autoantibodies. Antibodies and autoantibodies are proteins made by the immune system. Antibodies protect you from disease by fighting foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. Autoantibodies can cause disease by attacking the body's healthy cells by mistake.
CCP antibodies target healthy tissues in the joints. If CCP antibodies are found in your blood, it can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive, autoimmune disease that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. CCP antibodies are found in more than 75 percent of people who have rheumatoid arthritis. They are almost never found in people who don't have the disease.
Other names:  Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, anticitrullinated peptide antibody, citrulline antibody, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide, anti-CCP antibody, ACPA
","What is it used for?
A CCP antibody test is used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. It's often done along with or after a rheumatoid factor (RF) test. Rheumatoid factors are another type of autoantibody. RF tests used to be the main test to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. But RF factors can be found in people with other autoimmune diseases and even in some healthy people. Many studies have shown that CCP antibodies provide a more accurate diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis compared with RF testing.
","Why do I need a CCP antibody test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include:

Joint pain
Joint stiffness, especially in the morning
Joint swelling
Fatigue
Low-grade fever

You may also need this test if other tests couldn't confirm or rule out a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
","What happens during a CCP antibody test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Be sure to tell your health care provider about all medicines, vitamins, and dietary supplements you are taking. You may need to stop taking certain substances for 8 hours before your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your CCP antibody results were positive, it means these antibodies were found in your blood. A negative result means no CCP antibodies were found. The meaning of these results may depend on the results of a rheumatoid factor (RF) test as well as a physical exam.
If you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and your results show:

Positive CCP antibodies and positive RF, it likely means that you have rheumatoid arthritis.
Positive CCP antibodies and negative RF, it may mean you are in the early stages of rheumatoid arthritis or will develop it in the future.
Negative CCP antibodies and negative RF, it means you are less likely to have rheumatoid arthritis. Your provider may need to do more tests to help find out what is causing your symptoms.

Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CCP antibody test?
Rheumatoid arthritis can be difficult to diagnose, especially in its early stages. Your provider may order one or more tests in addition to CCP antibody and RF tests. These include x-rays of your joints and the following blood tests:

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
Synovial fluid analysis
C-reactive protein
Antinuclear antibody

These blood tests can show signs of inflammation. Inflammation is a type of immune system response. It can be a symptom of rheumatoid arthritis.
"
cd4 lymphocyte count,"What is a CD4 count?
A CD4 count is a test that measures the number of CD4 cells in your blood. CD4 cells, also known as T cells, are white blood cells that fight infection and play an important role in your immune system. A CD4 count is used to check the health of the immune system in people infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus).
HIV attacks and destroys CD4 cells. If too many CD4 cells are lost, your immune system will have trouble fighting off infections. A CD4 count can help your health care provider find out if you are at risk for serious complications from HIV. The test can also check to see how well HIV medicines are working.
Other names: CD4 lymphocyte count, CD4+ count, T4 count, T-helper cell count, CD4 percent

","What is it used for?
A CD4 count may be used to:

See how HIV is affecting your immune system. This can help your health care provider find out if you are at higher risk for complications from the disease.
Decide whether to start or change your HIV medicine
Diagnose AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)
	
The names HIV and AIDS are both used to describe the same disease. But most people with HIV don't have AIDS. AIDS is diagnosed when your CD4 count is extremely low.
AIDS is the most severe form of HIV infection. It badly damages the immune system and can lead to opportunistic infections. These are serious, often life-threatening, conditions that take advantage of very weak immune systems.



You may also need a CD4 count if you've had an organ transplant. Organ transplant patients take special medicines to make sure the immune system won't attack the new organ. For these patients, a low CD4 count is good, and means the medicine is working.

","Why do I need a CD4 count?
Your health care provider may order a CD4 count when you are first diagnosed with HIV. You will probably be tested again every few months to see if your counts have changed since your first test. If you are being treated for HIV, your health care provider may order regular CD4 counts to see how well your medicines are working.
Your provider may include other tests with your CD4 count, including:

A CD4-CD8 ratio. CD8 cells are another type of white blood cell in the immune system. CD8 cells kill cancer cells and other invaders. This test compares the numbers of the two cells to get a better idea of immune system function.
HIV viral load, a test that measures the amount of HIV in your blood.


","What happens during a CD4 count?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a CD4 count.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
CD4 results are given as a number of cells per cubic millimeter of blood. Below is a list of typical results. Your results may vary depending on your health and even the lab used for testing. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

Normal: 500–1,200 cells per cubic millimeter
Abnormal: 250–500 cells per cubic millimeter. It means you have a weakened immune system and may be infected with HIV.
Abnormal: 200 or fewer cells per cubic millimeter. It indicates AIDS and a high risk of life-threatening opportunistic infections.

While there is no cure for HIV, there are different medicines you can take to protect your immune system and can prevent you from getting AIDS. Today, people with HIV are living longer, with a better quality of life than ever before. If you are living with HIV, it's important to see your health care provider regularly.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

c. diff testing,"What is C. diff testing?C. diff testing checks for signs of a C. diff infection, a serious, sometimes life-threatening disease of the digestive tract. C. diff, also known as C. difficile, stands for Clostridium difficile. It is a type of bacteria found in your digestive tract.There are many types of bacteria that live in your digestive system. Most are ""healthy"" or ""good"" bacteria, but some are harmful or ""bad."" The good bacteria help with digestion and control the growth of bad bacteria. Sometimes, the balance of good and bad bacteria gets upset. This is most often caused by some types of antibiotics, which can kill both good and bad bacteria.C. diff is not normally harmful. But when the bacteria in the digestive system get out of balance, C. diff bacteria can grow out of control. When C. diff gets overgrown, it makes toxins that are released into the digestive tract. This condition is known a C. diff infection. A C. diff infection causes symptoms that range from mild diarrhea to life-threatening inflammation of the large intestine. It is especially dangerous to people with weakened immune systems.C. diff infections are most often caused by the use of certain antibiotics. But C. diff can also be contagious. C. diff bacteria are passed into stool. The bacteria can spread from person to person when a someone with an infection doesn't thoroughly wash their hands after a bowel movement. They may then spread the bacteria to food and other surfaces they touch. If you come in contact with a contaminated surface and then touch your mouth, you may get the infection.Other names: C. difficile, Clostridium difficile, Glutamate dehydrogenase test GDH Clostridioides difficile, C. difficile toxin test
","What is it used for?C. diff testing is most often used to find out if diarrhea is being caused by C. diff bacteria.

cea test,"What is a CEA test?CEA stands for carcinoembryonic antigen. It is a protein found in the tissues of a developing baby. CEA levels normally become very low or disappear after birth. Healthy adults should have very little or no CEA in their body.This test measures the amount of CEA in the blood, and sometimes in other body fluids. CEA is a type of tumor marker. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body.A high level of CEA can be a sign of certain types of cancers. These include cancers of the colon and rectum, prostate, ovary, lung, thyroid, or liver. High CEA levels may also be a sign of some noncancerous conditions, such as cirrhosis, noncancerous breast disease, and emphysema.A CEA test can't tell you what kind of cancer you have, or even whether you have cancer. So the test is not used for cancer screening or diagnosis. But if you've already been diagnosed with cancer, a CEA test can help monitor the effectiveness of your treatment and/or help find out if the disease has spread to other parts of your body.Other names: CEA assay, CEA blood test, carcinoembryonic antigen test
","What is it used for?A CEA test may be used to:Monitor treatment of people with certain types of cancers. These include colon cancer and cancers of the rectum, prostate, ovary, lung, thyroid, and liver.Figure out the stage of your cancer. This means checking the size of the tumor and how far the cancer has spread.See if cancer has returned after treatment.
","Why do I need a CEA test?You may need this test if you've been diagnosed with cancer. Your health care provider may test you before you start treatment, and then regularly throughout the course of your therapy. This can help your provider see how well your treatment is working. You may also get a CEA test after you've completed treatment. The test can help show whether the cancer has come back.
","What happens during a CEA test?
CEA is usually measured in the blood. During a CEA blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Sometimes, CEA is tested in the spinal fluid or from fluid in the abdominal wall. For these tests, your provider will remove a small sample of fluid using a thin needle and/or syringe. The following fluids may be tested:

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a clear, colorless liquid found in the spinal cord
Peritoneal fluid, a fluid that lines your abdominal wall
Pleural fluid, a liquid inside your chest cavity that covers the outside of each lung

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a CEA blood test or a pleural fluid test.You may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before a CSF or peritoneal fluid test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a CEA blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.CEA tests of body fluids are usually very safe. Serious problems are rare. But you may experience one or more of the following side effects:If you had a CSF test, you may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted. Some people get a headache after the test. This is called a post-lumbar headache.If you had a peritoneal fluid test, you may feel a little dizzy or lightheaded after the procedure. There is a small risk of damage to the bowel or bladder, which may cause an infection.If you had a pleural fluid test, there is a small risk of lung damage, infection, or blood loss.
","What do the results mean?If you were tested before you started treatment for cancer, your results may show:A low level of CEA. This may mean your tumor is small and the cancer has not spread to other parts of your body.A high level of CEA. This may mean you have a larger tumor and/or your cancer may have spread.If you are being treated for cancer, you may be tested several times throughout treatment. These results may show:Your levels of CEA started high and remained high. This may mean your cancer is not responding to treatment.Your levels of CEA started high but then decreased. This may mean your treatment is working.Your CEA levels decreased, but then later increased. This may mean your cancer has come back after you've been treated.If you had a test on a body fluid (CSF, peritoneal, or pleural), a high level of CEA may mean the cancer has spread to that area.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CEA test?Many cancers don't produce CEA. If your CEA results were normal, you may still have cancer. Also, high levels of CEA can be sign of a noncancerous health condition. In addition, people who smoke cigarettes often have higher than normal CEA levels.
"
celiac disease screening,"What is a celiac disease test?
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes a serious allergic reaction to gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It's also found in certain products, including some toothpastes, lipsticks, and medicines. A celiac disease test looks for antibodies to gluten in the blood. Antibodies are disease-fighting substances made by the immune system.
Normally, your immune system attacks things like viruses and bacteria. If you have celiac disease, eating gluten makes your immune system attack the lining of the small intestine, as if it were a harmful substance. This can damage your digestive system and may prevent you from getting the nutrients you need.
Other names: celiac disease antibody test, anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG), deaminated gliadin peptide antibodies, anti-endomysial antibodies

","What is it used for?
A celiac disease test is used to:

Diagnose celiac disease
Monitor celiac disease
See if a gluten-free diet is relieving symptoms of celiac disease


","Why do I need a celiac disease test?
You may need a celiac disease test if you have symptoms of celiac disease. Symptoms are different for children and adults.
Symptoms of celiac disease in children include:

Nausea and vomiting
Abdominal bloating
Constipation
Chronic diarrhea and foul-smelling stool
Weight loss and/or failure to gain weight
Delayed puberty
Irritable behavior

Symptoms of celiac disease in adults include digestive problems such as:

Nausea and vomiting
Chronic diarrhea
Unexplained weight loss
Decreased appetite
Abdominal pain
Bloating and gas

Many adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to digestion. These include:

Iron-deficient anemia
An itchy rash called dermatitis herpetiformis
Mouth sores
Bone loss
Depression or anxiety
Fatigue
Headaches
Missed menstrual periods
Tingling in the hands and/or feet

If you don't have symptoms, you may need a celiac test if you are at higher risk of having the disease. You are more likely to have celiac disease if a close family member has celiac disease. You may also be at higher risk if you have another autoimmune disorder, such as type 1 diabetes.

","What happens during a celiac disease test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
If the test is being used to diagnose celiac disease, you'll need to continue to eat foods with gluten for a few weeks before testing. Your health care provider will give you specific instructions about how to prepare for the test.
If the test is being used to monitor celiac disease, you don't need any special preparations.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
There are different types of celiac disease antibodies. Your celiac test results may include information on more than one type of antibody. Typical results may show one of the following:

Negative: You probably don't have celiac disease.
Positive: You probably do have celiac disease.
Uncertain or indeterminate: It's unclear whether you have celiac disease.

If your results were positive or uncertain, your provider may order a test called an intestinal biopsy to confirm or rule out celiac disease. During an intestinal biopsy, a health care provider will use a special tool called an endoscope to take a small piece of tissue from your small intestine.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a celiac disease test?
Most people with celiac disease can reduce and often eliminate symptoms if they keep a strict gluten-free diet. Although many gluten-free products are available today, it can still be challenging to completely avoid gluten. Your health care provider may refer you to a dietician who can help you enjoy a healthy diet without gluten.

cerebrospinal fluid (csf) analysis,"What is a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis?Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, colorless liquid found in your brain and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord make up your central nervous system. Your central nervous system controls and coordinates everything you do including, muscle movement, organ function, and even complex thinking and planning. CSF helps protect this system by acting like a cushion against sudden impact or injury to the brain or spinal cord. CSF also removes waste products from the brain and helps your central nervous system work properly.A CSF analysis is a group of tests that look at your cerebrospinal fluid to help diagnose diseases and conditions that affect the brain and spinal cord.Other names: Spinal Fluid Analysis, CSF Analysis
","What is it used for?A CSF analysis may include tests to diagnose:Infectious diseases of the brain and spinal cord, including meningitis and encephalitis. CSF tests for infections look at white blood cells, bacteria, and other substances in the cerebrospinal fluidAutoimmune disorders, such as Guillain-Barré Syndrome and multiple sclerosis (MS). CSF tests for these disorders look for high levels of certain proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid. These tests are called albumin protein and igG/albumin.Bleeding in the brainBrain tumors
","Why do I need a CSF analysis?You may need a CSF analysis if you have symptoms of an infection of the brain or spinal cord, or of an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).Symptoms of a brain or spinal cord infection include:FeverSevere headacheSeizuresStiff neckNausea and vomitingSensitivity to lightDouble visionChanges in behaviorConfusionSymptoms of MS include:Blurred or double visionTingling in the arms, legs, or faceMuscle spasmsWeak musclesDizzinessBladder control problemsSymptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome include weakness and tingling in the legs, arms, and upper body.You may also need a CSF analysis if you've had an injury to your brain or spinal cord, or have been diagnosed with cancer that has spread to the brain or spinal cord.
","What happens during a CSF analysis?Your cerebrospinal fluid will be collected through a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure:You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure.

ceruloplasmin test,"What is a ceruloplasmin test?This test measures the amount of ceruloplasmin in your blood. Ceruloplasmin is a protein that is made in the liver. It stores and carries copper from the liver into the bloodstream and to the parts of your body that need it.Copper is a mineral that is found in several foods, including nuts, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, and liver. It is important to many body functions, including building strong bones, producing energy, and making melanin (the substance that gives skin its color). But if you have too much or too little copper in your blood, it can be a sign of a serious health problem.Other names: CP, ceruloplasmin blood test, ceruloplasmin, serum
","What is it used for?A ceruloplasmin test is most often used, along with copper testing, to help diagnose Wilson disease. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from removing excess copper. It can cause a dangerous buildup of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs.It may also be used to diagnose disorders that cause a copper deficiency (too little copper).

"
chickenpox and shingles tests,"What are chickenpox and shingles tests?
These tests check to see if you are or have ever been infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV). This virus causes chickenpox and shingles. When you are first infected with VZV, you get chickenpox. Once you get chickenpox, you can't get it again. The virus remains in your nervous system but is dormant (inactive). Later in life, VZV can become active and can cause shingles. Unlike chicken pox, you can get shingles more than once, but it is rare.
Both chickenpox and shingles cause blistering skin rashes. Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease that causes red, itchy sores (pox) all over the body. It used to be a very common childhood disease, infecting nearly all children in the United States. But since a chickenpox vaccine was introduced in 1995, there have been far fewer cases. Chickenpox may be uncomfortable, but it's usually a mild illness in healthy children. But it can be serious for adults, pregnant women, newborns, and people with weakened immune systems.
Shingles is a disease that only affects people who once had chickenpox. It causes a painful, burning rash that may stay in one part of the body or spread to many parts of the body. Nearly one-third of people in the United States will get shingles at some point in their lifetime, most often after the age of 50. Most people who develop shingles recover in three to five weeks, but it sometimes causes long-term pain and other health problems.
Other names: varicella zoster virus antibody, serum varicella immunoglobulin G antibody level, VZV antibodies IgG and IgM, herpes zoster
","What are they used for?
Health care providers can usually diagnose chickenpox or shingles with a visual examination. Tests are sometimes ordered to check for immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV). You have immunity if you've had chickenpox before or have had the chickenpox vaccine. If you have immunity it means you can't get chickenpox, but you can still get shingles later in life.
Tests may be done on people who don't have or are unsure about immunity and are at higher risk of complications from VZV. These include:

Pregnant women
Newborns, if the mother is infected
Teen and adults with symptoms of chickenpox
People with HIV/AIDS or another condition that weakens the immune system

","Why do I need a chickenpox or shingles test?
You may need a chickenpox or shingles test if you are at risk for complications, are not immune to VZV, and/or have symptoms of infection. Symptoms of the two diseases are similar and include:

Red, blistering rash. Chickenpox rashes often appear all over the body and are usually very itchy. Shingles sometimes appear in just one area and are often painful.
Fever
Headache
Sore throat

You may also need this test if you are in a high-risk group and were recently exposed to chickenpox or shingles. You can't catch shingles from another person. But the shingles virus (VZV) can be spread and cause chickenpox in someone who doesn't have immunity.
","What happens during chickenpox and shingles testing?
You will need to provide a sample of blood from your vein or from the fluid in one of your blisters. Blood tests check for antibodies to the VZV. Blister tests check for the virus itself.
For a blood test from a vein, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
For a blister test, a health care provider will gently press a cotton swab on a blister to collect a sample of fluid for testing.
Both types of tests are quick, usually taking less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for a blood or blister test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There is no risk to having a blister test.
","What do the results mean?
If you have symptoms and results show VZV antibodies or the virus itself, it's likely you have chickenpox or shingles. Your diagnosis of either chickenpox or shingles will depend on your age and specific symptoms. If your results show antibodies or the virus itself and you don't have symptoms, you either once had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine.
If you are diagnosed with an infection and are in a high-risk group, your health care provider may prescribe antiviral medicines. Early treatment can prevent serious and painful complications.
Most healthy children and adults with chickenpox will recover from chickenpox within a week or two. Home treatment can help relieve symptoms. More serious cases may be treated with antiviral medicines. Shingles may also be treated with antiviral medicines as well as pain relievers.
If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about chickenpox and shingles tests?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the chickenpox vaccine for children, teens, and adults who never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. Some schools require this vaccine for admittance. Check with your child's school and your child's health care provider for more information.
The CDC also recommends that healthy adults age 50 and older get a shingles vaccine even if they've already had shingles. The vaccine can prevent you from having another outbreak. There are currently two types of shingles vaccines available. To learn more about these vaccines, talk to your health care provider.

cholesterol levels,"What is a cholesterol test?Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in your blood and every cell of your body. You need some cholesterol to keep your cells and organs healthy. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs. But you can also get cholesterol from the foods you eat, especially meat, eggs, poultry, and dairy products. Foods that are high in dietary fat can also make your liver produce more cholesterol.There are two main types of cholesterol: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or ""bad"" cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or ""good"" cholesterol. A cholesterol test is a blood test that measures the amount of each type of cholesterol and certain fats in your blood.Too much LDL cholesterol in your blood may put you at risk for heart disease and other serious conditions. High LDL levels can cause the build-up of plaque, a fatty substance that narrows the arteries and blocks blood from flowing normally. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, it can cause a heart attack. When blood flow to the brain is blocked, it can lead to stroke and peripheral artery disease.Other names for a cholesterol test: Lipid profile, Lipid panel
","What is it used for?If you have high cholesterol, you may not experience any symptoms at all, but you could be at significant risk for heart disease. A cholesterol test can give your health care provider important information about the cholesterol levels in your blood. The test measures:LDL levels. Also known as the ""bad"" cholesterol, LDL is the main source of blockages in the arteries.HDL levels. Considered the ""good"" cholesterol, HDL helps get rid of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol.Total cholesterol. The combined amount of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in your blood.Triglycerides A type of fat found in your blood. According to some studies, high levels of triglycerides may increase the risk of heart disease, especially in women.VLDL levels. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) is another type of ""bad"" cholesterol. Development of plaque on the arteries has been linked to high VLDL levels. It's not easy to measure VLDL, so most of the time these levels are estimated based on triglyceride measurements.
","Why do I need a cholesterol test?Your doctor may order a cholesterol test as part of a routine exam, or if you have a family history of heart disease or one or more of the following risk factors:High blood pressureType 2 diabetesSmokingExcess weight or obesityLack of physical activityA diet high in saturated fatYour age may also be a factor, because your risk for heart disease increases as you get older.
","What happens during a cholesterol test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.Cholesterol tests are usually done in the morning, as you may be asked to refrain from eating for several hours prior to the test.You may also be able to use an at-home kit to test for cholesterol. While instructions may vary between brands, your kit will include some kind of device to prick your finger. You’ll use this device to collect a drop of blood for testing. Be sure to follow the kit instructions carefully.Also, be sure to tell your health care provider if your at-home test results shown your cholesterol level is higher than 200 mg/dl.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You may need to fast--no food or drink--for 9 to 12 hours before your blood is drawn. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Cholesterol is usually measured in milligrams (mg) of cholesterol per deciliter (dL) of blood. The information below shows how the different types of cholesterol measurements are categorized.Total Cholesterol LevelCategoryLess than 200mg/dLDesirable200-239 mg/dLBorderline high240mg/dL and aboveHighLDL (Bad) Cholesterol LevelLDL Cholesterol CategoryLess than 100mg/dLOptimal100-129mg/dLNear optimal/above optimal130-159 mg/dLBorderline high160-189 mg/dLHigh190 mg/dL and aboveVery HighHDL (Good) Cholesterol LevelHDL Cholesterol Category60 mg/dL and higherConsidered protective against heart disease40-59 mg/dLThe higher, the betterLess than 40 mg/dLA major risk factor for heart diseaseA healthy cholesterol range for you may depend on your age, family history, lifestyle, and other risk factors. In general, low LDL levels and high HDL cholesterol levels are good for heart health. High levels of triglycerides may also put you at risk for heart disease.The LDL on your results may say ""calculated"" which means it includes a calculation of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Your LDL level may also be measured ""directly,"" without using other measurements. Regardless, you want your LDL number to be low.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about my cholesterol levels?High cholesterol can lead to heart disease, the number one cause of death in the United States. While some risk factors for cholesterol, such as age and heredity, are beyond your control, there are actions you can take to lower your LDL levels and reduce your risk, including:Eating a healthy diet. Reducing or avoiding foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol can help reduce the cholesterol levels in your blood.Losing weight. Being overweight can increase your cholesterol and risk for heart disease.Staying active. Regular exercise may help lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol levels and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It may also help you lose weight.Talk to your health care provider before making any major change in your diet or exercise routine.

coagulation factor tests,"What are coagulation factor tests?Coagulation factors are proteins in the blood that help control bleeding. You have several different coagulation factors in your blood. When you get a cut or other injury that causes bleeding, your coagulation factors work together to form a blood clot. The clot stops you from losing too much blood. This process is called the coagulation cascade.Coagulation factor tests are blood tests that check the function of one or more of your coagulation factors. Coagulation factors are known by Roman numerals (I, II VIII, etc.) or by name (fibrinogen, prothrombin, hemophilia A, etc.). If any of your factors are missing or defective, it can lead to heavy, uncontrolled bleeding after an injury.Other names: blood clotting factors, factor assays, factor assay by number (Factor I, Factor II, Factor VIII, etc.) or by name (fibrinogen, prothrombin, hemophilia A, hemophilia B, etc.)
","What is it used for?A coagulation factor test is used to find out if you have a problem with any of your coagulation factors. If a problem is found, you likely have a condition known as a bleeding disorder. There are different types of bleeding disorders. Bleeding disorders are very rare. The most well-known bleeding disorder is hemophilia. Hemophilia is caused when coagulation factors VIII or IX are missing or defective.You may be tested for one or more factors at a time.
","Why do I need a coagulation factor test?You may need this test if you have a family history of bleeding disorders. Most bleeding disorders are inherited. That means it is passed down from one or both of your parents.You may also need this test if your health care provider thinks you have a bleeding disorder that is not inherited. Although uncommon, other causes of bleeding disorders include:Liver diseaseVitamin K deficiencyBlood-thinning medicinesIn addition, you may need a coagulation factor test if you have symptoms of a bleeding disorder. These include:Heavy bleeding after an injuryEasy bruisingSwellingPain and stiffnessAn unexplained blood clot. In some bleeding disorders, the blood clots too much, rather than too little. This can be dangerous, because when a blood clot travels in your body, it can cause a heart attack, stroke, or other life-threatening conditions.

cognitive testing,"What is cognitive testing?Cognitive testing checks for problems with cognition. Cognition is a combination of processes in your brain that's involved in almost every aspect of your life. It includes thinking, memory, language, judgment, and the ability to learn new things. A problem with cognition is called cognitive impairment. The condition ranges from mild to severe.There are many causes of cognitive impairment. They include side effects of medicines, blood vessel disorders, depression, and dementia. Dementia is a term used for a severe loss of mental functioning. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia.Cognitive testing can't show the specific cause of impairment. But testing can help your provider find out if you need more tests and/or take steps to address the problem.There are different types of cognitive tests. The most common tests are:Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE)Mini-CogAll three tests measure mental functions through a series of questions and/or simple tasks.Other names: cognitive assessment, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA test, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), and Mini-Cog
","What is it used for?Cognitive testing is often used to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI may notice changes in their memory and other mental functions. The changes aren't severe enough to have a major effect on your daily life or usual activities. But MCI can be a risk factor for more serious impairment. If you have MCI, your provider may give you several tests over time to check for a decline in mental function.
","Why do I need cognitive testing?You may need cognitive testing if you show signs of cognitive impairment. These include:Forgetting appointments and important eventsLosing things oftenHaving trouble coming up with words that you usually knowLosing your train of thought in conversations, movies, or booksIncreased irritability and/or anxietyYour family or friends may suggest testing if they notice any of these symptoms.
","What happens during a cognitive test?There are different types of cognitive tests. Each involves answering a series of questions and/or performing simple tasks. They are designed to help measure mental functions, such as memory, language, and the ability to recognize objects. The most common types of tests are:Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. A 10-15 minute test that includes memorizing a short list of words, identifying a picture of an animal, and copying a drawing of a shape or object.Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE). A 7-10 minute test that includes naming the current date, counting backward, and identifying everyday objects like a pencil or watch.Mini-Cog. A 3-5 minute test that includes recalling a three-word list of objects and drawing a clock.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for cognitive testing?You don't need any special preparations for a cognitive test.
","Are there any risks to testing?There is no risk to having cognitive testing.
","What do the results mean?If your test results were not normal, it means you have some problem with memory or other mental function. But it won't diagnose the cause. Your health care provider may need to do more tests to find out the reason. Some types of cognitive impairment are caused by treatable medical conditions. These include:Thyroid diseaseSide effects of medicinesVitamin deficienciesIn these cases, cognition problems may improve or even clear up entirely after treatment.Other types of cognitive impairment are not curable. But medicines and healthy lifestyle changes may help slow mental decline in some cases. A diagnosis of dementia may also help patients and their families prepare for future health needs.If you have questions or are concerned about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about cognitive testing?The MoCA test is usually better at finding mild cognitive impairment. The MMSE is better at finding more serious cognitive problems. The Mini-Cog is often used because it is quick, easy-to-use, and widely available. Your health care provider may do one or more of these tests, depending on your condition.
"
colposcopy,"What is a colposcopy?
A colposcopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to closely examine a woman's cervix, vagina, and vulva. It uses a lighted, magnifying device called a colposcope. The device is placed at the opening of the vagina. It magnifies the normal view, allowing your provider to see problems that can't be seen by the eyes alone.
If your provider sees a problem, he or she may take a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy). The sample is most often taken from the cervix. This procedure is known as a cervical biopsy. Biopsies may also be taken from the vagina or vulva. A cervical, vaginal, or vulvar biopsy can show if you have cells that are at risk for becoming cancer. These are called precancerous cells. Finding and treating precancerous cells may prevent cancer from forming.
Other names: colposcopy with directed biopsy
","What is it used for?
A colposcopy is most often used to find abnormal cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva. It may also be used to:

Check for genital warts, which may be a sign of an HPV (human papillomavirus) infection. Having HPV may put you at higher risk for developing cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer.
Look for noncancerous growths called polyps
Check for irritation or inflammation of the cervix

If you've already been diagnosed and treated for HPV, the test may be used to monitor cell changes in the cervix. Sometimes abnormal cells return after treatment.
","Why do I need a colposcopy?
You may need this test if you had abnormal results on your Pap smear. A Pap smear is a test that involves getting a sample of cells from the cervix. It can show if there are abnormal cells, but it can't provide a diagnosis. A colposcopy provides a more detailed look at the cells, which may help your provider confirm a diagnosis and/or find other potential problems.
You may also need this test if:

You have been diagnosed with HPV
Your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a routine pelvic exam
You have bleeding after sex

","What happens during a colposcopy?
A colposcopy may be done by your primary care provider or by a gynecologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating diseases of the female reproductive system. The test is usually done in the provider's office. If abnormal tissue is found, you may also get a biopsy.
During a colposcopy:

You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.
You will lie on your back on an exam table with your feet in stirrups.
Your provider will insert a tool called a speculum into your vagina. It is used to spread open your vaginal walls.
Your provider will gently swab your cervix and vagina with a vinegar or iodine solution. This makes abnormal tissues easier to see.
Your provider will place the colposcope near your vagina. But the device will not touch your body.
Your provider will look through the colposcope, which provides a magnified view of the cervix, vagina, and vulva. If any areas of tissue look abnormal, your provider may perform a cervical, vaginal, or vulvar biopsy.

During a biopsy:

A vaginal biopsy can be painful, so your provider may first give you a medicine to numb the area.
Once the area is numb, your provider will use a small tool to remove a sample of tissue for testing. Sometimes many samples are taken.
Your provider may also do a procedure called an endocervical curettage (ECC) to take a sample from the inside of the opening of the cervix. This area can't be seen during a colposcopy. An ECC is done with a special tool called a curette. You may feel a slight pinch or cramp as the tissue is removed.
Your provider may apply a topical medicine to the biopsy site to treat any bleeding you may have.

After a biopsy, you should not douche, use tampons, or have sex for a week after your procedure, or for as long as your health care provider advises.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Do not douche, use tampons or vaginal medicines, or have sex for at least 24 hours before the test. Also, it's best to schedule your colposcopy when you are not having your menstrual period. And be sure to tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Colposcopy is generally safe during pregnancy, but if a biopsy is needed, it can cause extra bleeding.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a colposcopy. You may have some discomfort when the speculum is inserted into the vagina, and the vinegar or iodine solution may sting.
A biopsy is also a safe procedure. You may feel a pinch when the tissue sample is taken. After the procedure, your vagina may be sore for a day or two. You may have some cramping and slight bleeding. It's normal to have a little bleeding and discharge for up to a week after the biopsy.
Serious complications from a biopsy are rare, but call your provider if you have any of the following symptoms:

Heavy bleeding
Abdominal pain
Signs of infection, such as fever, chills and/or bad smelling vaginal discharge

","What do the results mean?
During your colposcopy, your provider may find one or more of the following conditions:

Genital warts
Polyps
Swelling or irritation of the cervix
Abnormal tissue

If your provider also performed a biopsy, your results may show you have:

Precancerous cells in the cervix, vagina, or vulva
An HPV infection
Cancer of the cervix, vagina, or vulva

If your biopsy results were normal, it's unlikely that you have cells in your cervix, vagina, or vulva that are at risk for turning into cancer. But that can change. So your provider may want to monitor you for cell changes with more frequent Pap smears and/or additional colposcopies.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a colposcopy?
If your results showed you have precancerous cells, your provider may schedule another procedure to remove them. This may prevent cancer from developing. If cancer was found, you may be referred to a gynecologic oncologist, a provider who specializes in treating cancers of the female reproductive system.
"
complement blood test,"What is a complement blood test?
A complement blood test measures the amount or activity of complement proteins in the blood. Complement proteins are part of the complement system. This system is made up of a group of proteins that work with the immune system to identify and fight disease-causing substances like viruses and bacteria.
There are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. Complement proteins may be measured individually or together. C3 and C4 proteins are the most commonly tested individual complement proteins. A CH50 test (sometimes called CH100) measures the amount and activity of all the major complement proteins.
If the test shows that your complement protein levels are not normal or that the proteins aren't working with the immune system as well as they should, it can be a sign of an autoimmune disease or other serious health problem.
Other names: complement antigen, compliment activity C3, C4, CH50, CH100, C1 C1q, C2
","What is it used for?
A complement blood test is most often used to diagnose or monitor autoimmune disorders such as:

Lupus, a chronic disease affecting multiple parts of the body, including the joints, blood vessels, kidneys, and brain
Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes pain and swelling of the joints, mostly in the hands and feet

It may also be used to help diagnose certain bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.
","Why do I need a complement blood test?
You may need a complement blood test if you have symptoms of an autoimmune disorder, especially lupus. Symptoms of lupus include:

A butterfly-shaped rash across your nose and cheeks
Fatigue
Mouth sores
Hair loss
Sensitivity to sunlight
Swollen lymph nodes
Chest pain when breathing deeply
Joint pain
Fever

You may also need this test if you are being treated for lupus or other autoimmune disorder. The test can show how well the treatment is working.
","What happens during a complement blood test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Are there any risks to a complement blood test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show lower than normal amounts or decreased activity of complement proteins, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Lupus
Rheumatoid arthritis
Cirrhosis
Certain types of kidney disease
Hereditary angioedema, a rare but serious disorder of the immune system. It can cause swelling of the face and airways.
Malnutrition
A recurrent infection (usually bacterial)

If your results show higher than normal amounts or increased activity of complement proteins, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Certain types of cancer, such as leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma
Ulcerative colitis, a condition in which the lining of the large intestine and rectum become inflamed

If you are being treated for lupus or another autoimmune disease, increased amounts or activity of complement proteins may mean your treatment is working.

comprehensive metabolic panel (cmp),"What is a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)?
A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) is a test that measures 14 different substances in your blood. It provides important information about your body's chemical balance and metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how the body uses food and energy. A CMP includes tests for the following:

Glucose, a type of sugar and your body's main source of energy.
Calcium, one of the body's most important minerals. Calcium is essential for proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart.
Sodium, potassium, carbon dioxide, and chloride. These are electrolytes, electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body.
Albumin, a protein made in the liver.
Total protein, which measures the total amount of protein in the blood.
ALP (alkaline phosphatase), ALT (alanine transaminase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase). These are different enzymes made by the liver.
Bilirubin, a waste product made by the liver.
BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine, waste products removed from your blood by your kidneys.

concussion tests,"What are concussion tests?Concussion tests can help find out if you or your child has suffered a concussion. A concussion is a type of brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head. Young children are at a higher risk of concussions because they are more active and because their brains are still developing.Concussions are often described as mild traumatic brain injuries. When you get a concussion, your brain shakes or bounces inside your skull. It causes chemical changes in the brain and affects brain function. After a concussion, you may have headaches, mood changes, and problems with memory and concentration. The effects are usually temporary, and most people make a full recovery after treatment. The main treatment for a concussion is rest, both physical and mental. Left untreated, a concussion can cause long-term brain damage.Other names: concussion assessment
","What are they used for?Concussion tests are used to assess brain function after a head injury. A type of concussion test, called a baseline test, is often used for athletes who play contact sports, a common cause of concussion. A baseline concussion test is used on non-injured athletes before the start of a sports season. It measures normal brain function. If a player gets injured, the baseline results are compared with the concussion tests performed after the injury. This helps the health care provider see if the concussion has caused any problems with brain function.
","Why do I need concussion testing?You or your child may need concussion testing after a head injury, even if you think the injury is not serious. Most people don't lose consciousness from a concussion. Some people get concussions and don't even know it. It's important to watch for concussion symptoms so you or your child can get treated promptly. Early treatment can help you recover faster and prevent further injury.Concussion symptoms include:HeadacheNausea and vomitingFatigueConfusionDizzinessSensitivity to lightChanges in sleep patternsMood changesDifficulty concentratingMemory problemsSome of these concussion symptoms show up right away. Others may not show up for weeks or months after the injury.Certain symptoms may mean a more serious brain injury than a concussion. Call 911 or seek immediate medical attention if you or your child has any of the following symptoms:Inability to be woken up after injurySevere headacheSeizuresSlurred speechExcessive vomiting
","What happens during concussion testing?Testing usually includes questions about concussion symptoms and a physical exam. You or your child may also be checked for changes in:VisionHearingBalanceCoordinationReflexesMemoryConcentrationAthletes may get concussion baseline testing before the start of a season. A baseline concussion test usually involves taking an online questionnaire. The questionnaire measures attention, memory, speed of answers, and other abilities.Testing sometimes includes one of the following types of imaging tests:CT (computerized tomography) scan, a type of x-ray that takes a series of pictures as it rotates around youMRI (magnetic resonance imaging), which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create an image. It does not use radiation.In the near future, a blood test may also be used to help diagnose a concussion. The FDA recently approved a test, called the Brain Trauma Indicator, for adults with concussions. The test measures certain proteins that are released into the bloodstream within 12 hours of a head injury. The test may be able to show how serious the injury is. Your provider may use the test to decide whether or not you need a CT scan.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a concussion test?You don't need any special preparations for concussion testing.
","Are there any risks to the tests?There is little risk to having concussion testing. CT scans and MRIs are painless, but can be a little uncomfortable. Some people feel claustrophobic in an MRI scanning machine.
","What do the results mean?If your results show that you or your child has a concussion, rest will be the first and most important step in your recovery. This includes getting plenty of sleep and not doing any strenuous activities.You'll also need to rest your mind too. This is known as cognitive rest. It means limiting schoolwork or other mentally challenging activities, watching TV, using the computer, and reading. As your symptoms improve, you can gradually increase your level of physical and mental activities. Talk to your health care provider or your child's provider for specific recommendations. Taking enough time to recover can help ensure a full recovery.For athletes, there may be specified steps, called a concussion protocol, that are recommended in addition to the steps listed above. These include:Not returning to the sport for seven or more daysWorking with coaches, trainers, and medical professionals to assess the athlete's conditionComparing baseline and after-injury concussion results
","Is there anything else I need to know about concussion testing?There are steps you can take to prevent concussions. These include:Wearing helmets while biking, skiing, and doing other sportsRegularly checking sports equipment for proper fit and functionWearing seatbeltsKeeping the home safe with well-lit rooms and removing objects from floors that might cause someone to trip. Falls in the home are a leading cause of head injury.Preventing concussions is important for everyone, but it's especially crucial for people who have had a concussion in the past. Having a second concussion close to the time of the first injury can cause additional health problems and lengthen recovery time. Having more than one concussion in your lifetime may also cause some long-term health problems.

cord blood testing and banking,"What are cord blood testing and cord blood banking?Cord blood is the blood left in the umbilical cord after a baby is born. The umbilical cord is the rope-like structure that connects a mother to her unborn baby during pregnancy. It contains blood vessels that bring nourishment to the baby and remove waste products. After a baby is born, the cord is cut with a small piece remaining. This piece will heal and form the baby's belly button.Cord blood testingOnce the umbilical cord has been cut, a health care provider may take a sample of blood from the cord for testing. These tests may measure a variety of substances and check for infections or other disorders.Cord blood bankingSome people want to bank (save and store) blood from their baby's umbilical cord for future use in treating diseases. The umbilical cord is full of special cells called stem cells. Unlike other cells, stem cells have the ability to grow into many different types of cells. These include bone marrow, blood cells, and brain cells. Stem cells in cord blood can be used to treat certain blood disorders, including leukemia, Hodgkin disease, and some types of anemia. Researchers are studying whether stem cells can also treat other types of diseases.
","What is cord blood testing used for?Cord blood testing may be used to:Measure blood gases. This helps to see if a baby's blood has a healthy level of oxygen and other substances.Measure bilirubin levels. Bilirubin is a waste product made by the liver. High bilirubin levels can be a sign of a liver disease.Perform a blood culture. This test may be done if a provider thinks a baby has an infection.Measure different parts of the blood with a complete blood count. This is done more often on premature babies.Check for signs of a baby's exposure to illegal or misused prescription drugs a mother may have taken during pregnancy. Umbilical cord blood can show signs of a variety of drugs, including opiates; such as heroin and fentanyl; cocaine; marijuana; and sedatives. If any of these drugs are found in cord blood, a health care provider can take steps to treat the baby and help avoid complications such as developmental delays.
",,,,"Is there any preparation needed for cord blood testing or banking?There are no special preparations needed for cord blood testing. If you want to bank your baby's cord blood, talk to your health care provider early in your pregnancy. This will give you time to get more information and review your options.
","Are there any risks to cord blood testing or banking?There is no risk to cord blood testing. Cord blood banking at a private facility can be very expensive. The cost is usually not covered by insurance.
","What do cord blood test results mean?Cord blood test results will depend on what substances were measured. If results were not normal, talk to your health care provider to see if your baby needs treatment.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

cortisol test,"What is a cortisol test?Cortisol is a hormone that affects almost every organ and tissue in your body. It plays an important role in helping you to:Respond to stressFight infectionRegulate blood sugarMaintain blood pressureRegulate metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energyCortisol is made by your adrenal glands, two small glands located above the kidneys. A cortisol test measures the level of cortisol in your blood, urine, or saliva. Blood tests are the most common way of measuring cortisol. If your cortisol levels are too high or too low, it may mean you have a disorder of your adrenal glands. These disorders can be serious if not treated.Other names: urinary cortisol, salivary cortisol, free cortisol, dexamethasone suppression test, DST, ACTH stimulation test, blood cortisol, plasma cortisol, plasma
","What is it used for?A cortisol test is used to help diagnose disorders of the adrenal gland. These include Cushing's syndrome, a condition that causes your body to make too much cortisol, and Addison disease, a condition in which your body doesn't make enough cortisol.
","Why do I need a cortisol test?You may need a cortisol test if you have symptoms of Cushing's syndrome or Addison disease.Symptoms of Cushing's syndrome include:Obesity, especially in the torsoHigh blood pressureHigh blood sugarPurple streaks on the stomachSkin that bruises easilyMuscle weaknessWomen may have irregular menstrual periods and excess hair on the faceSymptoms of Addison disease include:Weight lossFatigueMuscle weaknessAbdominal painDark patches of skinLow blood pressureNausea and vomitingDiarrheaDecreased body hairYou may also need a cortisol test if you have symptoms of an adrenal crisis, a life-threatening condition that can happen when your cortisol levels are extremely low. Symptoms of an adrenal crisis include:Very low blood pressureSevere vomitingSevere diarrheaDehydrationSudden and severe pain in the abdomen, lower back, and legsConfusionLoss of consciousness
","What happens during a cortisol test?A cortisol test is usually in the form of a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.Because cortisol levels change throughout the day, the timing of a cortisol test is important. A cortisol blood test is usually done twice a day–once in the morning when cortisol levels are at their highest, and again around 4 p.m., when levels are much lower.Cortisol may also be measured in a urine or saliva test. For a cortisol urine test, your health care provider may ask you to collect all urine during a 24-hour period. This is called a ""24-hour urine sample test."" It is used because cortisol levels vary throughout the day. For this test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test usually includes the following steps:Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.A cortisol saliva test is usually done at home, late at night, when cortisol levels are lower. Your health care provider will recommend or provide you with a kit for this test. The kit will likely include a swab to collect your sample and a container to store it. Steps usually include the following:Do not eat, drink, or brush your teeth for 15-30 minutes before the test.Collect the sample between 11 p.m. and midnight, or as instructed by your provider.Put the swab into your mouth.Roll the swab in your mouth for about 2 minutes so it can get covered in saliva.Don't touch the tip of the swab with your fingers.Put the swab into the container within the kit and return it to your provider as instructed.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?Stress can raise your cortisol levels, so you may need to rest before your test. A blood test will require you to schedule two appointments at different times of the day. Twenty-four hour urine and saliva tests are done at home. Be sure to follow all the instructions given by your provider.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. There are no known risks to a urine or saliva test.
","What do the results mean?High levels of cortisol may mean you have Cushing's syndrome, while low levels may mean you have Addison disease or another type of adrenal disease. If your cortisol results are not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Other factors, including infection, stress, and pregnancy can affect your results. Birth control pills and other medicines can also affect your cortisol levels. To learn what your results mean, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a cortisol test?If your cortisol levels are not normal, your health care provider will likely order more tests before making a diagnosis. These tests may include additional blood and urine tests and imaging tests, such as CT (computerized tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans, which allow your provider to look at your adrenal and pituitary glands.
"
c-peptide test,"What is a C-peptide test?
This test measures the level of C-peptide in your blood or urine. C-peptide is a substance made in the pancreas, along with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the body's glucose (blood sugar) levels. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. If your body doesn't make the right amount of insulin, it may be a sign of diabetes.
C-peptide and insulin are released from the pancreas at the same time and in about equal amounts. So a C-peptide test can show how much insulin your body is making. This test can be a good way to measure insulin levels because C-peptide tends to stay in the body longer than insulin.
Other names: insulin C-peptide, connecting peptide insulin, proinsulin C-peptide

","What is it used for?
A C-peptide test is often used to help tell the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. With type 1 diabetes, your pancreas makes little to no insulin, and little or no C-peptide. With type 2 diabetes, the body makes insulin, but doesn't use it well. This can cause C-peptide levels to be higher than normal.
The test may also be used to:

Find the cause of low blood sugar, also known as hypoglycemia.
Check if diabetes treatments are working.
Check on the status of a pancreatic tumor.


","Why do I need a C-peptide test?
You may need a C-peptide test if your health care provider thinks you have diabetes, but is unsure whether it is type 1 or type 2. You may also need a C-peptide test if you have symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Symptoms include:

Sweating
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Abnormal hunger
Blurred vision
Confusion
Fainting


","What happens during a C-peptide test?
A C-peptide test is usually given as a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
C-peptide can also be measured in urine. Your health care provider may ask you to collect all urine passed in a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For this test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give a container in which to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test generally includes the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.
For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.
Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.
Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before a C-peptide blood test. If your health care provider has ordered a C-peptide urine test, be sure to ask if there are any specific instructions you need to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
There are no known risks to a urine test.

","What do the results mean?
A low level of C-peptide can mean your body isn't making enough insulin. It may be a sign of one of the following conditions:

Type 1 diabetes
Addison disease, a disorder of the adrenal glands
Liver disease

It may also be a sign that your diabetes treatment is not working well.
A high level of C-peptide can mean your body is making too much insulin. It may be a sign of one of the following conditions:

Type 2 diabetes
Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body doesn't respond the right way to insulin. It causes the body to make too much insulin, raising your blood sugar to very high levels.
Cushing's syndrome, a disorder in which your body makes too much of a hormone called cortisol.
A tumor of the pancreas

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a C-peptide test?
A C-peptide test can provide important information about the type of diabetes you have and whether or not your diabetes treatment is working well. But it is not used to diagnose diabetes. Other tests, such as blood glucose and urine glucose, are used to screen and diagnose diabetes.
"
c-reactive protein (crp) test,"What is a c-reactive protein (CRP) test?
A c-reactive protein test measures the level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in your blood. CRP is a protein made by your liver. It's sent into your bloodstream in response to inflammation. Inflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues if you've been injured or have an infection. It can cause pain, redness, and swelling in the injured or affected area. Some autoimmune disorders and chronic diseases can also cause inflammation.
Normally, you have low levels of c-reactive protein in your blood. High levels may be sign of a serious infection or other disorder.
Other names: c-reactive protein, serum

","What is it used for?
A CRP test may be used to find or monitor conditions that cause inflammation. These include:

Bacterial infections, such as sepsis, a severe and sometimes life-threatening condition
A fungal infection
Inflammatory bowel disease, a disorder that causes swelling and bleeding in the intestines
An autoimmune disorder such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
An infection of the bone called osteomyelitis


","Why do I need a CRP test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a serious bacterial infection. Symptoms include:

Fever
Chills
Rapid breathing
Rapid heart rate
Nausea and vomiting

If you've already been diagnosed with an infection or have a chronic disease, this test may be used to monitor your treatment. CRP levels rise and fall depending on how much inflammation you have. If your CRP levels go down, it's a sign that your treatment for inflammation is working.

","What happens during a CRP test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This process usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a CRP test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
If your results show a high level of CRP, it probably means you have some type of inflammation in your body. A CRP test doesn't explain the cause or location of the inflammation. So if your results are not normal, your health care provider may order more tests to figure out why you have inflammation.
A higher than normal CRP level does not necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. There are other factors that can raise your CRP levels. These include cigarette smoking, obesity, and lack of exercise.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CRP test?
A CRP test is sometimes confused with a high-sensitivity-(hs) CRP test. Although they both measure CRP, they are used to diagnose different conditions. An hs-CRP test measures much lower levels of CRP. It is used to check for risk of heart disease.
"
creatine kinase,"What is a creatine kinase (CK) test?This test measures the amount of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood. CK is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. It is mostly found in your skeletal muscles and heart, with lesser amounts in the brain. Skeletal muscles are the muscles attached to your skeleton. They work with your bones to help you move and give your body power and strength. Heart muscles pump blood in and out of the heart.There are three types of CK enzymes:CK-MM, found mostly in skeletal musclesCK-MB, found mostly in the heart muscleCK-BB, found mostly in brain tissueA small amount of CK in the blood is normal. Higher amounts can mean a health problem. Depending on the type and level of CK found, it can mean you have damage or disease of the skeletal muscles, heart, or brain.Other names: CK, total CK, creatine phosphokinase, CPK
","What is it used for?A CK test is most often used to diagnose and monitor muscular injuries and diseases. These diseases include:Muscular dystrophy, a rare inherited disease that causes weakness, breakdown, and loss of function of skeletal muscles. It mostly occurs in males.Rhabdomyolis, a rapid breakdown of muscle tissue. It can be caused by a serious injury, muscle disease, or other disorder.The test can be used to help diagnose a heart attack, though not very often. CK testing used to be a common test for heart attacks. But another test, called troponin, has been found to be better at detecting heart damage.
","Why do I need a CK test?You may need a CK test if you have symptoms of a muscular disorder. These include:Muscle pain and/or crampsMuscle weaknessBalance problemsNumbness or tinglingYou may also need this test if you had a muscle injury or stroke. CK levels may not peak until up to two days after certain injuries, so you may need to be tested a few times. This test can help show if you have damage to your heart or other muscles.
","What happens during a CK test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

"
creatinine test,"What is a creatinine test?This test measures creatinine levels in blood and/or urine. Creatinine is a waste product made by your muscles as part of regular, everyday activity. Normally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and send it out of the body in your urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in the blood and less will be released in urine. If blood and/or urine creatinine levels are not normal, it can be a sign of kidney disease.Other names: blood creatinine, serum creatinine, urine creatinine
","What is it used for?A creatinine test is used to see if your kidneys are working normally. It's often ordered along with another kidney test called blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A CMP is a group of tests that provide information about different organs and systems in the body. A CMP is frequently included in a routine checkup.

"
crystals in urine,"What is a crystals in urine test?Your urine contains many chemicals. Sometimes these chemicals form solids, called crystals. A crystals in urine test looks at the amount, size, and type of crystals in your urine. It's normal to have a few small urine crystals. Larger crystals or specific types of crystals can become kidney stones. Kidney stones are hard, pebble-like substances that can get stuck in the kidneys. A stone can be as small as a grain of sand, as big as a pea, or even larger. While kidney stones rarely cause serious damage, they can be very painful.Other names: urinalysis (crystals) microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine
","What is it used for?A crystals in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different substances in your urine. A urinalysis may include a visual check of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination of urine cells under a microscope. A crystals in urine test is part of a microscopic exam of urine. It may be used to help diagnose kidney stones or a problem with your metabolism, the process of how your body uses food and energy.

csf immunoglobulin g (igg) index,"What is a CSF IgG index?
CSF stands for cerebrospinal fluid. It is a clear, colorless liquid found in your brain and spinal cord. The brain and spinal cord make up your central nervous system. Your central nervous system controls and coordinates everything you do, including muscle movement, organ function, and even complex thinking and planning.
IgG stands for immunoglobulin G, a type of antibody. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight viruses, bacteria, and other foreign substances. A CSF IgG index measures the levels of IgG in your cerebrospinal fluid. High levels of IgG can mean you have an autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder causes your immune system to attack healthy cells, tissues, and/or organs by mistake. These disorders can cause serious health problems.
Other names: cerebrospinal fluid IgG level, cerebrospinal fluid IgG measurement, CSF IgG level, IgG (Immunoglobulin G) spinal fluid, IgG synthesis rate

","What is it used for?
A CSF IgG index is used to check for diseases of the central nervous system. It is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system. Many people with MS have disabling symptoms including severe fatigue, weakness, difficulty walking, and vision problems. About 80 percent of MS patients have higher than normal levels of IgG.

","Why do I need a CSF IgG index?
You may need a CSF IgG index if you have symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS).
Symptoms of MS include:

Blurred or double vision
Tingling in the arms, legs, or face
Muscle spasms
Weak muscles
Dizziness
Bladder control problems
Sensitivity to light
Double vision
Changes in behavior
Confusion


","What happens during a CSF IgG index?
Your cerebrospinal fluid will be collected through a procedure called a spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture. A spinal tap is usually done in a hospital. During the procedure:

You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.
A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.
Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.
Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.
You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.
Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a CSF IgG index, but you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a spinal tap. You may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. After the test, you may get a headache, called a post-lumbar headache. About one in 10 people will get a post-lumbar headache. This can last for several hours or up to a week or more. If you have a headache that lasts longer than several hours, talk to your health care provider. He or she may be able to provide treatment to relieve the pain.
You may feel some pain or tenderness in your back at the site where the needle was inserted. You may also have some bleeding at the site.

","What do the results mean?
If your CSF IgG index shows higher than normal levels, it may indicate:

Multiple sclerosis
Another autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis
Chronic infection such as HIV or hepatitis
Multiple myeloma, a cancer that affects white blood cells

If your IgG index shows lower than normal levels, it may indicate:

A disorder that weakens the immune system. These disorders make it hard to fight infections.

If your IgG index results are not normal, it may not mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Results can vary depending on a variety of factors including your age and overall health, and medicines you are taking. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a CSF IgG index?
The CSF IgG index is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is not specifically an MS test. There is no single test that can tell you whether you have MS. If your health care provider thinks you have MS, you will probably have several other tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
While there is no cure for MS, there are many treatments available that can help relieve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.
"
d-dimer test,"What is a D-dimer test?
A D-dimer test looks for D-dimer in blood. D-dimer is a protein fragment (small piece) that's made when a blood clot dissolves in your body.
Blood clotting is an important process that prevents you from losing too much blood when you are injured. Normally, your body will dissolve the clot once your injury has healed. With a blood clotting disorder, clots can form when you don't have an obvious injury or don't dissolve when they should. These conditions can be very serious and even life-threatening. A D-dimer test can show if you have one of these conditions.
Other names: fragment D-dimer, fibrin degradation fragment
","What is it used for?
A D-dimer test is most often used to find out whether you have a blood clotting disorder. These disorders include:

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot that's deep inside a vein. These clots usually affect the lower legs, but they can also happen in other parts of the body.
Pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage in an artery in the lungs. It usually happens when a blood clot in another part of the body breaks loose and travels to the lungs. DVT clots are a common cause of PE.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition that causes too many blood clots to form. They can form throughout the body, causing organ damage and other serious complications. DIC may be caused by traumatic injuries or certain types of infections or cancer.
Stroke, a blockage in the blood supply to the brain.

","Why do I need a D-dimer test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a blood clotting disorder, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE).
Symptoms of DVT include:

Leg pain or tenderness
Leg swelling
Redness or red streaks on the legs

Symptoms of PE include:

Trouble breathing
Cough
Chest pain
Rapid heartbeat

This test is often done in an emergency room or other health care setting. If you have DVT symptoms and are not in a health care setting, call your health care provider. If you have symptoms of PE, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.
","What happens during a D-dimer test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a D-dimer test.
","Are there any risks to a D-dimer test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show low or normal D-dimer levels in the blood, it means you probably don't have a clotting disorder. 
If your results show higher than normal levels of D-dimer, it may mean you have a clotting disorder. But it cannot show where the clot is located or what type of clotting disorder you have. Also, high D-dimer levels are not always caused by clotting problems. Other conditions that can cause high D-dimer levels include pregnancy, heart disease, and recent surgery. If your D-dimer results were not normal, your provider will probably order more tests to make a diagnosis.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a D-dimer test?
If your D-dimer test results were not normal, your provider may order one or more imaging tests to find out if you have a clotting disorder. These include:

Doppler ultrasound, a test that uses sound waves to create images of your veins.
CT angiography. In this test, you are injected with a special dye that helps your blood vessels show up on a special type of x-ray machine.
Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. These are two tests that may be done separately or together. They both use small amounts of radioactive substances to help a scanning machine see how well air and blood move through your lungs.

dengue fever test,"What is a dengue fever test?Dengue fever is a viral infection spread by mosquitos. The virus can't be spread from person to person. Mosquitos that carry the dengue virus are most common in areas of the world with tropical and subtropical climates. These include parts of:South and Central AmericaSoutheast AsiaThe South PacificAfricaThe Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin IslandsDengue fever is rare in the U.S. mainland, but cases have been reported in Florida and in Texas near the Mexican border.Most people who get dengue fever have no symptoms, or mild, flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, and headache. These symptoms usually last for a week or so. But sometimes dengue fever can develop into a much more serious disease called dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).DHF causes life-threatening symptoms, including blood vessel damage and shock. Shock is a condition that can lead to a severe drop in blood pressure and organ failure.DHF mostly affects children under 10. It can also develop if you have dengue fever and get infected a second time before you have fully recovered from your first infection.A dengue fever test looks for signs of the dengue virus in the blood.While there is no medicine that can cure dengue fever or DHF, other treatments can help relieve symptoms. This can make you more comfortable if you have dengue fever. It can be lifesaving if you have DHF.Other names: dengue virus antibody, dengue virus by PCR
","What is it used for?A dengue fever test is used to find out if you have been infected with the dengue virus. It is mostly used for people who have symptoms of illness and have recently traveled to an area where dengue infections are common.
","Why do I need a dengue fever test?You may need this test if you live or have recently traveled to an area where dengue is common, and you have symptoms of dengue fever. Symptoms usually show up four to seven days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, and may include:Sudden high fever (104°F or higher)Swollen glandsRash on the faceSevere headache and/or pain behind the eyesJoint and muscle painNausea and vomitingFatigueDengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) causes more severe symptoms and can be life-threatening. If you've had symptoms of dengue fever and/or have been in an area that has dengue, you may be at risk for DHF. Seek medical help immediately if you or your child has one or more of the following symptoms:Severe abdominal painVomiting that doesn't go awayBleeding gumsNose bleedsBleeding under the skin, which may look like bruisesBlood in urine and/or stoolsDifficulty breathingCold, clammy skinRestlessness
","What happens during a dengue fever test?Your health care provider will probably ask about your symptoms and for details on your recent travels. If an infection is suspected, you will get a blood test to check for the dengue virus.During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a dengue fever test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?A positive result means you probably have been infected with the dengue virus. A negative result can mean you aren't infected or you were tested too soon for the virus to show up in testing. If you think you were exposed to the dengue virus and/or have symptoms of infection, talk to your health care provider about whether you need to be retested.If your results were positive, talk to your health care provider about how to best treat your dengue fever infection. There are no medicines for dengue fever, but your provider will probably recommend that you get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids to avoid dehydration. You may also be advised to take over-the-counter pain relievers with acetaminophen (Tylenol), to help ease body aches and reduce fever. Aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are not recommended, as they may worsen bleeding.If your results are positive and you have symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever, you may need to go to the hospital for treatment. Treatment may include getting fluids through an intravenous (IV) line, a blood transfusion if you've lost a lot of blood, and careful monitoring of blood pressure.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

dental exam,"What is a dental exam?A dental exam is a checkup of your teeth and gums. Most children and adults should get a dental exam every six months. These exams are important for protecting oral health. Oral health problems can become serious and painful if not treated promptly.Dental exams are usually performed by both a dentist and a dental hygienist. A dentist is a doctor specially trained to care for teeth and gums. A dental hygienist is a health care professional trained to clean teeth and help patients maintain good oral health habits. Although dentists can treat people of all ages, children often go to pediatric dentists. Pediatric dentists are dentists who have received additional training to focus on dental care for children.Other names: dental checkup, oral exam
","What is it used for?Dental exams are used to help find tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health problems early, when they're easier to treat. The exams are also used to help educate people on the best ways to care for their teeth and gums.
","Why do I need a dental exam?Most adults and children should get a dental exam every six months. If you have swollen, bleeding gums (known as gingivitis) or other gum disease, your dentist may want to see you more often. Some adults with gum disease may see a dentist three or four times a year. More frequent exams may help prevent a serious gum disease known as periodontitis. Periodontitis can lead to infection and tooth loss.Babies should have their first dental appointment within six months of getting their first tooth, or by 12 months of age. After that, they should get an exam every six months, or according to the recommendation of your child's dentist. Also, your child may need to have more frequent visits if the dentist finds a problem with tooth development or another oral health issue.
","What happens during a dental exam?A typical dental exam will include a cleaning by a hygienist, x-rays on certain visits, and a checkup of your mouth by the dentist.During a cleaning:You or your child will sit in a large chair. A bright overhead light will shine above you. The hygienist will clean your teeth using small, metal dental tools. He or she will scrape your teeth to remove plaque and tartar. Plaque is a sticky film that contains bacteria and coats teeth. If plaque builds up on teeth, it turns into tartar, a hard mineral deposit that can get trapped at the bottom of teeth.The hygienist will floss your teeth.He or she will brush your teeth, using a special electric toothbrush.He or she may then apply a fluoride gel or foam to your teeth. Fluoride is a mineral that prevents tooth decay. Tooth decay can lead to cavities. Fluoride treatments are given to children more often than to adults.The hygienist or dentist may give you tips on how to care for your teeth, including proper brushing and flossing techniques.Dental x-rays are images that can show cavities, gum disease, bone loss, and other problems that can't be seen by just looking at the mouth.During an x-ray, the dentist or hygienist will:Place a thick covering, called a lead apron, over your chest. You may get an additional covering for your neck to protect your thyroid gland. These coverings protect the rest of your body from radiation.Have you bite down on a small piece of plastic.Place a scanner outside your mouth. He or she will take a picture, while standing behind a protective shield or other area.For certain types of x-rays, you will repeat this process, biting down in different areas of your mouth, as instructed by the dentist or hygienist.There are different types of dental x-rays. A type called a full-mouth series may be taken once every few years to check your overall oral health. Another type, called bitewing x-rays, may be used more often to check for cavities or other tooth problems.During the dentist's checkup, the dentist will:Check your x-rays, if you've had them, for cavities or other problems.Look at your teeth and gums to see if they are healthy.Check the bite (the way the top and bottom teeth fit together). If there is a bite problem, you may be referred to an orthodontist.Check for oral cancer. This includes feeling under your jaw, checking the insides of your lips, the sides of your tongue, and on the roof and floor of your mouth.In addition to the above checks, a pediatric dentist may check to see if your child's teeth are developing normally.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a dental exam?If you have certain health conditions, you may need to take antibiotics before your exam. These conditions include:Heart problemsImmune system disordersRecent surgeryIf you're not sure whether you need to take antibiotics, talk to your dentist and/or other health care provider.Also, some people feel anxious about going to the dentist. If you or your child feels this way, you may want to talk to the dentist beforehand. He or she may be able to help you or your child feel more relaxed and comfortable during the exam.
","Are there any risks to a dental exam?There is very little risk to having a dental exam. The cleaning may be uncomfortable, but it is not usually painful.Dental x-rays are safe for most people. The dose of radiation in an x-ray is very low. But x-rays are not usually recommended for pregnant women, unless it's an emergency. Be sure to tell your dentist if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.
","What do the results mean?Results may include one or more of the following conditions:A cavityGingivitis or other gum problemsBone loss or tooth development problemsIf results show that you or your child has a cavity, you probably will need to make another appointment with the dentist to treat it. If you have questions about how cavities are treated, talk to the dentist.If results show that you have gingivitis or other gum problems, your dentist may recommend:Improving your brushing and flossing habits.More frequent dental cleanings and/or dental exams.Using a medicated mouth rinse.That you see a periodontist, a specialist in diagnosing and treating gum disease.If bone loss or tooth development problems are found, you may need more tests and/or dental treatments.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a dental exam?To keep your mouth healthy, you'll need to take good care of your teeth and gums, both by having regular dental exams and practicing good dental habits at home. Good home oral care includes the following steps:Brush your teeth twice a day using a soft-bristled brush. Brush for about two minutes.Use a toothpaste that has fluoride. Fluoride helps prevent tooth decay and cavities.Floss at least once a day. Flossing removes plaque, which can damage teeth and gums.Replace your toothbrush every three or four months.Eat a healthy diet, avoiding or limiting sweets and sugary drinks. If you do eat or drink sweets, brush your teeth soon after.Don't smoke. Smokers have more oral health problems than nonsmokers.

dhea sulfate test,"What is a DHEA sulfate test?
This test measures the levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) in your blood. DHEAS stands for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate. DHEAS is a male sex hormone that is found in both men and women. DHEAS plays an important role in making the male sex hormone testosterone and the female sex hormone estrogen. It’s also involved in the development of male sexual characteristics at puberty.
DHEAS is mostly made in the adrenal glands, two small glands located above your kidneys. They help control heart rate, blood pressure, and other body functions. Smaller amounts of DHEAS are made in a man’s testicles and in a woman’s ovaries. If your DHEAS levels are not normal, it may mean there is a problem with your adrenal glands or sex organs (testicles or ovaries.)
Other names:  DHEAS, DHEA-S, DHEA, DHEA-SO4, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
","What is it used for?
A DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) test is most often used to:

Find out if your adrenal glands are working right
Diagnose tumors of the adrenal glands
Diagnose disorders of the testicles or ovaries
Find out the cause of early puberty in boys
Find out the cause of excess body hair growth and development of masculine features in women and girls

A DHEAS test is often done along with other sex hormone tests. These include testosterone tests for men and estrogen tests for women.
","Why do I need a DHEA sulfate test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of high levels or low levels of DHEA sulfate (DHEAS). Men may not have any symptoms of high levels of DHEAS. Symptoms of high levels of DHEAS in women and girls may include:

Excess body and facial hair growth
Deepening of voice
Menstrual irregularities
Acne
Increased muscularity
Hair loss at the top of the head

Baby girls may also need testing if they have genitals that are not clearly male or female in appearance (ambiguous genitalia). Boys may need this test if they have signs of early puberty.
Symptoms of low levels of DHEAS may include the following signs of an adrenal gland disorder:

Unexplained weight loss
Nausea and vomiting
Dizziness
Dehydration
Craving for salt

Other symptoms of low DHEAS are related to aging and may include:

Decreased sex drive
Erectile dysfunction in men
Thinning of vaginal tissues in women

doppler ultrasound,"What is a Doppler ultrasound?A Doppler ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to show blood moving through blood vessels. A regular ultrasound also uses sound waves to create images of structures inside the body, but it can't show blood flow.Doppler ultrasound works by measuring sound waves that are reflected from moving objects, such as red blood cells. This is known as the Doppler effect.There are different types of Doppler ultrasound tests. They include:Color Doppler. This type of Doppler uses a computer to change sound waves into different colors. These colors show the speed and direction of blood flow in real time.Power Doppler, a newer type of color Doppler. It can provide more detail of blood flow than standard color Doppler. But it cannot show the direction of blood flow, which can be important in some cases.Spectral Doppler. This test shows blood flow information on a graph, rather than color pictures. It can help show how much of a blood vessel is blocked.Duplex Doppler. This test uses standard ultrasound to take images of blood vessels and organs. Then a computer turns the images into a graph, as in spectral Doppler.Continuous wave Doppler. In this test, sound waves are sent and received continuously. It allows for more accurate measurement of blood that flows at faster speeds.Other names: Doppler ultrasonography
","What is it used for?Doppler ultrasound tests are used to help health care providers find out if you have a condition that is reducing or blocking your blood flow. It may also be used to help diagnose certain heart diseases. The test is most often used to:Check heart function. It is often done along with an electrocardiogram, a test that measures electrical signals in the heart.Look for blockages in blood flow. Blocked blood flow in the legs can cause a condition called deep vein thrombosis (DVT).Check for blood vessel damage and for defects in the structure of the heart.Look for narrowing of blood vessels. Narrowed arteries in arms and legs can mean you have condition called peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Narrowing of arteries in the neck can mean you have a condition called carotid artery stenosis.Monitor blood flow after surgery.Check for normal blood flow in a pregnant woman and her unborn baby.
","Why do I need a Doppler ultrasound?You may need a Doppler ultrasound if you have symptoms of reduced blood flow or a heart disease. Symptoms vary depending on the condition causing the problem. Some common blood flow conditions and symptoms are below.Symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) include:Numbness or weakness in your legsPainful cramping in your hips or leg muscles when walking or climbing stairsCold feeling in your lower leg or footChange in color and/or shiny skin on your legSymptoms of heart problems include:Shortness of breathSwelling in your legs, feet, and/or abdomenFatigueYou may also need a Doppler ultrasound if you:Have had a stroke. After a stroke, your health care provider may order a special kind of Doppler test, called transcranial Doppler, to check blood flow to the brain.Had an injury to your blood vessels.Are being treated for a blood flow disorder.Are pregnant and your provider thinks you or your unborn baby might have a blood flow problem. Your provider may suspect a problem if your unborn baby is smaller than it should be at this stage of pregnancy or if you have certain health problems. These include sickle cell disease or preeclampsia, a type of high blood pressure that affects pregnant women.
","What happens during a Doppler ultrasound?A Doppler ultrasound usually includes the following steps:You will lie a table, exposing the area of your body that's being tested.A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over that area.The provider will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, over the area.The device sends sound waves into your body.The movement of blood cells causes a change in the pitch of the sound waves. You may hear swishing or pulse-like sounds during the procedure.The waves are recorded and turned into images or graphs on a monitor.After the test is over, the provider will wipe the gel off your body.The test takes about 30-60 minutes to complete.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?To prepare for a Doppler ultrasound, you may need to:Remove clothing and jewelry from the area of the body that is getting tested.Avoid cigarettes and other products that have nicotine for up to two hours before your test. Nicotine causes blood vessels to narrow, which can affect your results.For certain types of Doppler tests, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.Your health care provider will let you know if you need to do anything to prepare for your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having a Doppler ultrasound. It is also considered safe during pregnancy.
","What do the results mean?If your results were not normal, it may mean you have:A blockage or clot in an arteryNarrowed blood vesselsAbnormal blood flowAn aneurysm, a balloon-like bulge in the arteries. It causes the arteries to become stretched and thin. If the wall becomes too thin, the artery can rupture, causing life-threatening bleeding.Results may also show if there is abnormal blood flow in an unborn baby.The meaning of your results will depend what area of the body was being tested.

These may include heart defects, hearing loss, and thyroid disease. Down syndrome is a type of chromosome disorder.Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color.People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell.One of each pair of chromosomes comes from your mother, and the other pair comes from your father.In Down syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21.The extra chromosome changes the way the body and brain develop.Down syndrome, also called trisomy 21, is the most common chromosome disorder in the United States.In two rare forms of Down syndrome, called mosaic trisomy 21 and translocation trisomy 21, the extra chromosome doesn't show up in every cell. People with these disorders usually have fewer of the characteristics and health problems associated with the common form of Down syndrome.Down syndrome screening tests show whether your unborn baby is more likely to have Down syndrome. Other types of tests confirm or rule out the diagnosis.
","What are the tests used for?Down syndrome tests are used to screen for or diagnose Down syndrome. Down syndrome screening tests have little or no risk to you or your baby, but they can't tell you for sure whether your baby has Down syndrome.Diagnostic tests during pregnancy can confirm or rule out a diagnosis, but the tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage.
","Why do I need a Down syndrome test?Many health care providers recommend Down syndrome screening and/or diagnostic tests for pregnant women who are 35 years of age or older. A mother's age is the primary risk factor for having a baby with Down syndrome. The risk increases as a woman gets older. But you may also be at higher risk if you've already had a baby with Down syndrome and/or have a family history of the disorder.In addition, you may want to get tested to help you prepare if the results show your baby may have Down syndrome. Knowing in advance can give you time to plan for health care and support services for your child and family.But testing isn't for everyone. Before you decide to get tested, think about how you'd feel and what you might do after learning the results. You should discuss your questions and concerns with your partner and your health care provider.If you didn't get tested during pregnancy or want to confirm the results of other tests, you may want to have your baby tested if he or she has symptoms of Down syndrome. These include:Flattened face and noseAlmond-shaped eyes that slant upwardSmall ears and mouthTiny white spots on the eyePoor muscle toneDevelopmental delays
","What are the different types of Down syndrome tests?
There are two basic types of Down syndrome tests: screening and diagnostic tests.
Down syndrome screening includes the following tests done during pregnancy:

First trimester screening includes a blood test that checks the levels of certain proteins in the mother's blood. If levels are not normal, it means there is a higher chance of the baby having Down syndrome. The screening also includes an ultrasound, an imaging test that looks at the unborn baby for signs of Down syndrome. The test is done between the 10th and 14th week of pregnancy.
Second trimester screening. These are blood tests that also look for certain substances in the mother's blood that may be a sign of Down syndrome. A triple screen test looks for three different substances. It is done between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy. A quadruple screen test looks for four different substances and is done between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy. Your provider may order one or both of these tests.

If your Down syndrome screening shows a higher chance of Down syndrome, you may want to take a diagnostic test to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
Down syndrome diagnostic tests done during pregnancy include:

Amniocentesis, which takes a sample of amniotic fluid, the fluid that surrounds your unborn baby. It is usually done between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which takes a sample from the placenta, the organ that nourishes your unborn baby in your uterus. It's usually done between the 10th and 13th week of pregnancy.
Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), which takes a blood sample from the umbilical cord. PUBS gives the most accurate diagnosis of Down syndrome during pregnancy, but it can't be done until late in pregnancy, between the 18th and 22nd week.

Down syndrome diagnosis after birth:
Your baby may get a blood test that looks at his or her chromosomes. This test will tell you for sure whether your baby has Down syndrome.
","What happens during Down syndrome testing?During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For the first trimester ultrasound, a health care provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen. The device uses sound waves to look at your unborn baby. Your provider will check for thickness at the back of your baby's neck, which is a sign of Down syndrome.For amniocentesis:You'll lie on your back on an exam table.Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby.Your provider will insert a thin needle into your abdomen and withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid.For chorionic villus sampling (CVS):You'll lie on your back on an exam table.Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby.Your provider will collect cells from the placenta in one of two ways: either through your cervix with a thin tube called a catheter, or with a thin needle through your abdomen.For percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS):You'll lie on your back on an exam table.Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen to check the position of your uterus, placenta, baby, and umbilical cord.Your provider will insert a thin needle into the umbilical cord and withdraw a small blood sample.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests?There are no special preparations needed for Down syndrome testing. But you should talk to your health care provider about the risks and benefits of testing.
","Are there any risks to the tests?There is very little risk to having a blood test or ultrasound. After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.Amniocentesis, CVS, and PUBS tests are usually very safe procedures, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage.
","What do the results mean?Down syndrome screening results can only show if you have a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome, but they can't tell you for sure if your baby has Down syndrome You may have results that are not normal, but still deliver a healthy baby with no chromosomal defects or disorders.If your Down syndrome screening results were not normal, you may choose to have one or more diagnostic tests.It can help to speak to a genetic counselor before testing and/or after you get your results. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. He or she can help you understand what your results mean.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
"
drug testing,"What is a drug test?A drug test looks for the presence of one or more illegal or prescription drugs in your urine, blood, saliva, hair, or sweat. Urine testing is the most common type of drug screening. The drugs most often tested for include:MarijuanaOpioids, such as heroin, codeine, oxycodone, morphine, hydrocodone, and fentanylAmphetamines, including methamphetamineCocaineSteroidsBarbiturates, such as phenobarbital and secobarbitalPhencyclidine (PCP)Other names: drug screen, drug test, drugs of abuse testing, substance abuse testing, toxicology screen, tox screen, sports doping tests
","What is it used for?Drug screening is used to find out whether or not a person has taken a certain drug or drugs. It may be used for:Employment. Employers may test you before hiring and/or after hiring to check for on-the-job drug use.Sports organizations. Professional and collegiate athletes usually need to take a test for performance-enhancing drugs or other substances.Legal or forensic purposes. Testing may be part of a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation. Drug screening may also be ordered as part of a court case.Monitoring opioid use. If you've been prescribed an opioid for chronic pain, your health care provider may order a drug test to make sure you are taking the right amount of your medicine.
","Why do I need a drug test?You may have to take a drug test as a condition of your employment, in order to participate in organized sports, or as part of a police investigation or court case. Your health care provider may order drug screening if you have symptoms of drug abuse. These symptoms include:Slowed or slurred speechDilated or small pupilsAgitationPanicParanoiaDeliriumDifficulty breathingNauseaChanges in blood pressure or heart rhythm
","What happens during a drug test?A drug test generally requires that you give a urine sample in a lab. You will be given instructions to provide a ""clean catch"" sample. The clean catch method includes the following steps:Wash your handsClean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.Start to urinate into the toilet.Move the collection container under your urine stream.Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.Finish urinating into the toilet.Return the sample container to the lab technician or health care provider.In certain instances, a medical technician or other staff member may need to be present while you provide your sample.For a blood test for drugs, you will go to a lab to provide your sample. During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?Be sure to tell the testing provider or your health care provider if you are taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, or supplements because they may give you a positive result for certain illegal drugs. Also, you should avoid foods with poppy seeds, which can cause a positive result for opioids.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known physical risks to having a drug test, but a positive result may affect other aspects of your life, including your job, your eligibility to play sports, and the outcome of a court case.Before you take a drug test, you should be told what you are being tested for, why you are being tested, and how the results will be used. If you have questions or concerns about your test, talk to your health care provider or contact the individual or organization that ordered the test.
","What do the results mean?If your results are negative, it means no drugs were found in your body, or the level of drugs was below an established level, which differs depending on the drug. If your results are positive, it means one or more drugs were found in your body above an established level. However, false positives can happen. So if your first test shows that you have drugs in your system, you will have further testing to figure out whether or not you are actually taking a certain drug or drugs.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a drug test?
If you test positive for a legal drug prescribed by your doctor, your employer can’t penalize you for a positive result, unless the drug is affecting your ability to perform your job.
If you test positive for marijuana and live in state where it has been legalized, employers may be able penalize you. Many employers want to maintain a drug-free workplace. Also, marijuana is still illegal under federal law.
"
elastography,"What is an elastography?An elastography, also known as liver elastography, is a type of imaging test that checks the liver for fibrosis. Fibrosis is a condition that reduces blood flow to and inside the liver. This causes the buildup of scar tissue. Left untreated, fibrosis can lead to serious problems in the liver. These include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure. But early diagnosis and treatment can reduce or even reverse the effects of fibrosis.There are two types of liver elastography tests:Ultrasound elastography, also known as Fibroscan, the brand name of the ultrasound device. The test uses sound waves to measure the stiffness of liver tissue. Stiffness is a sign of fibrosis.MRE (magnetic resonance elastography), a test that combines ultrasound technology with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is a procedure that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create images of organs and structures inside the body. In an MRE test, a computer program creates a visual map that shows liver stiffness.Elastography testing may be used in place of a liver biopsy, a more invasive test that involves removing a piece of liver tissue for testing.Other names: liver elastography, transient elastography, Fibroscan, MR elastography
","What is it used for?An elastography is used to diagnose fatty liver disease (FLD) and fibrosis. FLD is a condition in which normal liver tissue is replaced by fat. This fat can lead to cell death and fibrosis.
","Why do I need an elastography?Many people with fibrosis don't have symptoms. But left untreated, fibrosis will continue to scar the liver and eventually turn into cirrhosis.Cirrhosis is a term used to describe excessive scarring of the liver. Cirrhosis is most often caused by alcohol abuse or hepatitis. In severe cases, cirrhosis can be life threatening. Cirrhosis does cause symptoms. So you may need this test if you have symptoms of cirrhosis or another liver disease.Symptoms of cirrhosis and other liver diseases are similar and may include:Yellowing of the skin. This is known as jaundice.FatigueItchingBruising easilyHeavy nosebleedsSwelling in the legsWeight lossConfusion
","What happens during an elastography?During an ultrasound (Fibroscan) elastography:You will lie on an examination table on your back, with your right abdominal area exposed.A radiology technician will spread gel on your skin over the area.He or she will place a wand-like device, called a transducer, on the area of skin that covers your liver.The probe will deliver a series of sound waves. The waves will travel to your liver and bounce back. The waves are so high pitched you can't hear them.You may feel a gentle flick as this is done, but it should not hurt.The sound waves are recorded, measured, and displayed on a monitor.The measurement shows the level of stiffness in the liver.The procedure only takes about five minutes, but your entire appointment may take a half hour or so.MRE (magnetic resonance elastography) is done with the same type of machine and many of the same steps as a traditional MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) test. During an MRE procedure:You will lie on a narrow examination table.A radiology technician will place a small pad on your abdomen. The pad will emit vibrations that pass through your liver.The table will slide into an MRI scanner, which is a tunnel-shaped machine that contains the magnet. You may be given earplugs or headphones before the test to help block the noise of the scanner, which is very loud.Once inside the scanner, the pad will activate and send measurements of vibrations from your liver. The measurements will be recorded onto a computer and turned into a visual map that shows the stiffness of your liver.The test takes about 30 to 60 minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an ultrasound elastography. If you are having an MRE, be sure to remove all metal jewelry and accessories before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having an ultrasound elastography. There is little risk to having an MRE for most people. Some people feel nervous or claustrophobic inside the scanner. If you feel this way, you may be given medicine before the test to help you relax.
","What do the results mean?Both types of elastography measure the stiffness of the liver. The stiffer the liver, the more fibrosis you have. Your results may range from no scarring to mild, moderate, or advanced liver scarring. Advanced scarring is known as cirrhosis. Your health care provider may order additional testing, including liver function blood tests or a liver biopsy, to confirm a diagnosis.If you are diagnosed with mild to moderate fibrosis, you may be able to take steps to stop further scarring and sometimes even improve your condition. These steps include:Not drinking alcoholNot taking illegal drugsEating a healthy dietIncreasing exerciseTaking medicine. There are medicines that are effective in treating some types of hepatitis.If you wait too long for treatment, more and more scar tissue will build up in your liver. This can lead to cirrhosis. Sometimes, the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis is a liver transplant.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an elastography?MRE testing may not be a good choice for people who have metal devices implanted in their bodies. These include pacemakers, artificial heart valves, and infusion pumps. The magnet in the MRI can affect the operation of these devices, and in some cases, it could be dangerous. Dental braces and certain types of tattoos that contain metal may also cause problems during the procedure.The test is also not recommended for women who are pregnant or think they might be pregnant. It is not known whether magnetic fields are harmful to unborn babies.
"
electrocardiogram,"What is an electrocardiogram (EKG) test?An electrocardiogram (EKG) test is a simple, painless procedure that measures electrical signals in your heart. Each time your heart beats, an electrical signal travels through the heart. An EKG can show if your heart is beating at a normal rate and strength. It also helps show the size and position of your heart's chambers. An abnormal EKG can be a sign of heart disease or damage.Other names: ECG test
","What is it used for?An EKG test is used to find and/or monitor various heart disorders. These include:Irregular heartbeat (known as arrhythmia)Blocked arteriesHeart damageHeart failureHeart attack. EKGs are often used in the ambulance, emergency room, or other hospital room to diagnose a suspected heart attack.An EKG test is sometimes included in a routine exam for middle-aged and older adults, as they have a higher risk of heart disease than younger people.
","Why do I need an EKG test?You may need an EKG test if you have symptoms of a heart disorder. These include:Chest painRapid heartbeatArrhythmia (it may feel like your heart has skipped a beat or is fluttering)Shortness of breathDizzinessFatigueYou may also need this test if you:Have had a heart attack or other heart problems in the pastHave a family history of heart diseaseAre scheduled for surgery. Your health care provider may want to check your heart health before the procedure.Have a pacemaker. The EKG can show how well the device is working.Are taking medicine for heart disease. The EKG can show if your medicine is effective, or if you need to make changes in your treatment.
","What happens during an EKG test?An EKG test may be done in a provider's office, outpatient clinic, or a hospital. During the procedure:You will lie on an exam table.A health care provider will place several electrodes (small sensors that stick to the skin) on your arms, legs, and chest. The provider may need to shave or trim excess hair before placing the electrodes.The electrodes are attached by wires to a computer that records your heart's electrical activity.The activity will be displayed on the computer's monitor and/or printed out on paper.The procedure only takes about three minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an EKG test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having an EKG. You may feel a little discomfort or skin irritation after the electrodes are removed. There is no risk of electric shock. The EKG doesn't send any electricity to your body. It only records electricity.
","What do the results mean?Your health care provider will check your EKG results for a consistent heartbeat and rhythm. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following disorders:ArrhythmiaA heartbeat that is too fast or too slowInadequate blood supply to the heartA bulge in the heart's walls. This bulge is known as an aneurysm.Thickening of the heart's wallsA heart attack (Results can show if you've had a heart attack in the past or if you are having an attack during the EKG.)If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

electrolyte panel,"What is an electrolyte panel?
Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help control the amount of fluids and the balance of acids and bases in your body. They also help control muscle and nerve activity, heart rhythm, and other important functions. An electrolyte panel, also known as a serum electrolyte test, is a blood test that measures levels of the body's main electrolytes:

Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly.
Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure.
Potassium, which helps your heart and muscles work properly.
Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance. It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream.

Abnormal levels of any of these electrolytes can be a sign of a serious health problem, including kidney disease, high blood pressure, and a life-threatening irregularity in heart rhythm.
Other names: serum electrolyte test, lytes, sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), carbon dioxide (CO2)
","What is it used for?
An electrolyte panel is often part of a routine blood screening or a comprehensive metabolic panel. The test may also be used to find out if your body has a fluid imbalance or an imbalance in acid and base levels.
Electrolytes are usually measured together. But sometimes they are tested individually. Separate testing may be done if a provider suspects a problem with a specific electrolyte.
","Why do I need an electrolyte panel?
You may need this test if you have symptoms indicating that your body's electrolytes may be out of balance. These include:

Nausea and/or vomiting
Confusion
Weakness
Irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia)

","What happens during an electrolyte panel?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for an electrolyte panel.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
Your results will include measurements for each electrolyte. Abnormal electrolyte levels can be caused by several different conditions, including:

Dehydration
Kidney disease
Heart disease
Diabetes
Acidosis, a condition in which you have too much acid in your blood. It can cause nausea, vomiting, and fatigue.
Alkalosis, a condition in which you have too much base in your blood. It can cause irritability, muscle twitching, and tingling in the fingers and toes.

Your specific results will depend on which electrolyte is affected and whether levels are too low or too high. If your electrolyte levels were not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical problem needing treatment. Many factors can affect electrolyte levels. These include taking in too much fluid or losing fluid because of vomiting or diarrhea. Also, certain medicines such as antacids and blood pressure medicines may cause abnormal results.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an electrolyte panel?
Your health care provider may order another test, called an anion gap, along with your electrolyte panel. Some electrolytes have a positive electric charge. Others have a negative electric charge. The anion gap is a measurement of the difference between the negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes. If the anion gap is either too high or too low, it may be a sign of a serious health problem.
"
electromyography (emg) and nerve conduction studies,"What are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies?
Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are tests that measure the electrical activity of muscles and nerves. Nerves send out electrical signals to make your muscles react in certain ways. As your muscles react, they give off these signals, which can then be measured.

An EMG test looks at the electrical signals your muscles make when they are at rest and when they are being used.
A nerve conduction study measures how fast and how well the body's electrical signals travel down your nerves.

EMG tests and nerve conduction studies can both help find out if you have a disorder of your muscles, nerves, or both. These tests can be done separately, but they are usually done at the same time.
Other names: electrodiagnostic study, EMG test, electromyogram, NCS, nerve conduction velocity, NCV
","What are they used for?
EMG and nerve conduction studies are used to help diagnose a variety of muscle and nerve disorders. An EMG test helps find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals. Nerve conduction studies help diagnose nerve damage or disease. When EMG tests and nerve conduction studies are done together, it helps providers tell if your symptoms are caused by a muscle disorder or a nerve problem.
","Why do I need an EMG test and a nerve conduction study?
You may need these tests if you have symptoms of a muscle or nerve disorder. These symptoms include:

Muscle weakness
Tingling or numbness in arms, legs, hands, feet, and/or face
Muscle cramps, spasms, and/or twitching
Paralysis of any muscles

","What happens during an EMG test and nerve conduction study?
For an EMG test:

You will sit or lie down on a table or bed.
Your provider will clean the skin over the muscle being tested.
Your provider will place a needle electrode into the muscle. You may have slight pain or discomfort when the electrode is inserted.
The machine will record the muscle activity while your muscle is at rest.
Then you will be asked to tighten (contract) the muscle slowly and steadily.
The electrode may be moved to record activity in different muscles.
The electrical activity is recorded and shown on a video screen. The activity is displayed as wavy and spiky lines. The activity may also be recorded and sent to an audio speaker. You may hear popping sounds when you contract your muscle.

For a nerve conduction study:

You will sit or lie down on a table or bed.
Your provider will attach one or more electrodes to a certain nerve or nerves using tape or a paste. The electrodes, called stimulating electrodes, deliver a mild electrical pulse.
Your provider will attach different types of electrodes to the muscle or muscles controlled by those nerves. These electrodes will record the responses to the electrical stimulation from the nerve.
Your provider will send a small pulse of electricity through the stimulating electrodes to stimulate the nerve to send a signal to the muscle.
This may cause a mild tingling feeling.
Your provider will record the time it takes for your muscle to respond to the nerve signal.
The speed of the response is called the conduction velocity.

If you are having both tests, the nerve conduction study will be done first.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests?
Tell your health care provider if you have a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator. Special steps will need to be taken before the test if you have one of these devices.
Wear loose, comfortable clothing that allows easy access to the test area or can be easily removed if you need to change into a hospital gown.
Make sure your skin is clean. Don't use lotions, creams, or perfumes for a day or two before the test.
","Are there any risks to the tests?
You may feel a little pain or cramping during an EMG test. You may have a tingly feeling, like a mild electric shock, during a nerve conduction study.
","What do the results mean?
If your results were not normal, it can indicate a variety of different conditions. Depending on which muscles or nerves are affected, it may mean one of the following:

Carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition that affects nerves in the hand and arm. It's usually not serious, but can be painful.
Herniated disc, a condition that happens when a part of your spine, called a disc, is damaged. This puts pressure on the spine, causing pain and numbness
Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerves. It can lead to numbness, tingling, and paralysis. Most people recover from the disorder after treatment
Myasthenia gravis, a rare disorder that causes muscle fatigue and weakness.
Muscular dystrophy, an inherited disease that seriously affects muscle structure and function.
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, an inherited disorder that causes nerve damage, mostly in the arms and legs.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. This is a progressive, ultimately fatal, disorder that attacks nerve cells in your brain and spinal cord. It affects all the muscles you use to move, speak, eat, and breathe.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

epithelial cells in urine,"What is an epithelial cells in urine test?Epithelial cells are a type of cell that lines the surfaces of your body. They are found on your skin, blood vessels, urinary tract, and organs. An epithelial cells in urine test looks at urine under a microscope to see if the number of your epithelial cells is in the normal range. It's normal to have a small amount of epithelial cells in your urine. A large amount may indicate an infection, kidney disease, or other serious medical condition.Other names: microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, urine test, urine analysis, UA
","What is it used for?An epithelial cells in urine test is a part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different substances in your urine. A urinalysis may include a visual examination of your urine sample, tests for certain chemicals, and an examination of urine cells under a microscope.

","What do the results mean?Results are often reported as an approximate amount, such as ""few,"" moderate,"" or ""many"" cells. ""Few"" cells are generally considered in the normal range. ""Moderate"" or ""many"" cells may indicate a medical condition such as:Urinary tract infectionYeast infectionKidney diseaseLiver diseaseCertain types of cancerIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have a medical condition that requires treatment. You may need more tests before you can get a diagnosis. To learn what your results mean, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an epithelial cells in urine test?There are three types of epithelial cells that line the urinary tract. They are called transitional cells, renal tubular cells, and squamous cells. If there are squamous epithelial cells in your urine, it may mean your sample was contaminated. This means that the sample contains cells from the urethra (in men) or the vaginal opening (in women). It can happen if you do not clean well enough when using the clean catch method.
"
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (esr),"What is an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)?An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a type of blood test that measures how quickly erythrocytes (red blood cells) settle at the bottom of a test tube that contains a blood sample. Normally, red blood cells settle relatively slowly. A faster-than-normal rate may indicate inflammation in the body. Inflammation is part of your immune response system. It can be a reaction to an infection or injury. Inflammation may also be a sign of a chronic disease, an immune disorder, or other medical condition.Other names: ESR, SED rate sedimentation rate; Westergren sedimentation rate
","What is it used for?An ESR test can help determine if you have a condition that causes inflammation. These include arthritis, vasculitis, or inflammatory bowel disease. An ESR may also be used to monitor an existing condition.
","Why do I need an ESR?Your health care provider may order an ESR if you have symptoms of an inflammatory disorder. These include:HeadachesFeverWeight lossJoint stiffnessNeck or shoulder painLoss of appetiteAnemia
","What happens during an ESR?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

","What do the results mean?If your ESR is high, it may be related to an inflammatory condition, such as:InfectionRheumatoid arthritisRheumatic feverVascular diseaseInflammatory bowel diseaseHeart diseaseKidney diseaseCertain cancersSometimes the ESR can be slower than normal. A slow ESR may indicate a blood disorder, such as:PolycythemiaSickle cell anemiaLeukocytosis, an abnormal increase in white blood cellsIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition that requires treatment. A moderate ESR may indicate pregnancy, menstruation, or anemia, rather than an inflammatory disease. Certain medicines and supplements can also affect your results. These include oral contraceptives, aspirin, cortisone, and vitamin A. Be sure to tell your health care provider about any drugs or supplements you are taking.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an ESR?An ESR does not specifically diagnose any diseases, but it can provide information about whether or not there is inflammation in your body. If your ESR results are abnormal, your health care provider will need more information and will likely order more lab tests before making a diagnosis.

estrogen levels test,"What is an estrogen test?An estrogen test measures the level of estrogens in the blood or urine. Estrogen can also be measured in saliva using at-home test kit. Estrogens are a group of hormones that play a key role in the development of female physical features and reproductive functions, including the growth of breasts and the uterus, and regulation of the menstrual cycle. Men also make estrogen but in much smaller amounts.There are many types of estrogens, but only three types are commonly tested:Estrone, also called E1, is the main female hormone made by women after menopause. Menopause is a time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old.Estradiol, also called E2, is the main female hormone made by nonpregnant women.Estriol, also called E3 is a hormone that increases during pregnancy.Measuring estrogen levels can provide important information about your fertility (the ability to get pregnant), the health of your pregnancy, your menstrual cycle, and other health conditions.Other names: estradiol test, estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), estrogenic hormone test
","What is it used for?Estradiol tests or estrone tests are used to help:Find out the reason for early or late puberty in girlsFind out the reason for late puberty in boysDiagnose menstrual problemsFind out the cause of infertility (the inability to get pregnant)Monitor infertility treatmentsMonitor treatments for menopauseFind tumors that make estrogenAn estriol hormone test is used to:Help diagnose certain birth defects during pregnancy.Monitor a high-risk pregnancy
","Why do I need an estrogen test?You may need an estradiol test or an estrone test if you:Are having trouble getting pregnantAre a woman of childbearing age who is not having periods or having abnormal periodsAre a girl with early or delayed pubertyHave symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and/or night sweatsHave vaginal bleeding after menopauseAre a boy with delayed pubertyAre a man showing female characteristics, such as the growth of breastsIf you are pregnant, your health care provider may order an estriol test between the 15th and 20th week of pregnancy as part of a prenatal test called a triple screen test. It can find out if your baby is at risk for a genetic birth defect such as Down syndrome. Not all pregnant women need to get an estriol test, but it is recommended for women who have a higher risk of having a baby with a birth defect. You may be at a higher risk if you:Have a family history of birth defectsAre age 35 or olderHave diabetesHave a viral infection during pregnancy
","What happens during an estrogen test?Estrogens can be tested in blood, urine, or saliva. Blood or urine is usually tested in doctor's office or lab. Saliva tests can be done at home.For a blood test:A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For a urine test:Your health care provider may ask you to collect all urine passed in a 24-hour period. This is called a 24-hour urine sample test. For this test, your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test generally includes the following steps:Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine down. Do not collect this urine. Record the time.For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.For an at-home saliva test, talk your health care provider.

","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.There is no known risk to a urine or saliva test.
","What do the results mean?If your estradiol or estrone levels are higher than normal, it may be due to:A tumor of the ovaries, adrenal glands, or testiclesCirrhosisEarly puberty in girls; delayed puberty in boysIf your estradiol or estrone levels are lower than normal, it may be due to:Primary ovarian insufficiency, a condition that causes a woman's ovaries to stop working before she is 40 years oldTurner syndrome, a condition in which a woman's sexual characteristics don't develop properlyAn eating disorder, such as anorexia nervosaPolycystic ovary syndrome, a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.If you are pregnant and your estriol levels are lower than normal, it may mean your pregnancy is failing or that there is a chance your baby might have a birth defect. If the test shows a possible birth defect, you will need more testing before a diagnosis can be made.Higher levels of estriol may mean you will be going into labor soon. Normally, estriol levels go up about four weeks before you start labor.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

fall risk assessment,"What is a fall risk assessment?
Falls are common in adults 65 years of age and older. In the United States, about a third of older adults who live at home and about half of people living in nursing homes fall at least once a year. There are many factors that increase the risk of falling in older adults. These include mobility problems, balance disorders, chronic illnesses, and impaired vision. Many falls cause at least some injury. These range from mild bruising to broken bones, head injuries, and even death. In fact, falls are a leading cause of death in older adults.
A fall risk assessment checks to see how likely it is that you will fall. It is mostly done for older adults. The assessment usually includes:

An initial screening. This includes a series of questions about your overall health and if you've had previous falls or problems with balance, standing, and/or walking.
A set of tasks, known as fall assessment tools. These tools test your strength, balance, and gait (the way you walk).

Other names: fall risk evaluation, fall risk screening, assessment, and intervention
","What is it used for?
A fall risk assessment is used to find out if you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. If the assessment shows you are at an increased risk, your health care provider and/or caregiver may recommend strategies to prevent falls and reduce the chance of injury.
","Why do I need a fall risk assessment?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Geriatric Society recommend yearly fall assessment screening for all adults 65 years of age and older. If the screening shows you are at risk, you may need an assessment. The assessment includes performing a series of tasks called fall assessment tools.
You also may need an assessment if you have certain symptoms. Falls often come without warning, but if you have any of the following symptoms, you may be at higher risk:

Dizziness
Light-headedness
Irregular or rapid heartbeats

","What happens during a fall risk assessment?
Many providers use an approach developed by the CDC called STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries). STEADI includes screening, assessing, and intervention. Interventions are recommendations that may reduce your risk of falling.
During the screening, you may be asked several questions including:

Have you fallen in the past year?
Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking?
Are you worried about falling?

During an assessment, your provider will test your strength, balance, and gait, using the following fall assessment tools:

Timed Up-and-Go (Tug). This test checks your gait. You'll start in a chair, stand up, and then walk for about 10 feet at your regular pace. Then you'll sit down again. Your health care provider will check how long it takes you to do this. If it takes you 12 seconds or more, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall.
30-Second Chair Stand Test. This test checks strength and balance. You'll sit in a chair with your arms crossed over your chest. When your provider says ""go,"" you'll stand up and sit down again. You'll repeat this for 30 seconds. Your provider will count how many times you can do this. A lower number may mean you are at higher risk for a fall. The specific number that indicates a risk depends on your age.
4-Stage Balance Test. This test checks how well you can keep your balance. You'll stand in four different positions, holding each one for 10 seconds. The positions will get harder as you go.

Position 1: Stand with your feet side-by-side.
Position 2: Move one foot halfway forward, so the instep is touching the big toe of your other foot.
Position 3 Move one foot fully in front of the other, so the toes are touching the heel of your other foot.
Position 4: Stand on one foot.



If you can't hold position 2 or position 3 for 10 seconds or you can't stand on one leg for 5 seconds, it may mean you are at higher risk for a fall.
There are many other fall assessment tools. If your provider recommends other assessments, he or she will let you know what to expect.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a fall risk assessment?
You don't need any special preparations for a fall risk assessment.
","Are there any risks to a fall risk assessment?
There is a small risk that you may fall as you do the assessment.
","What do the results mean?
The results may show you have a low, moderate, or high risk of falling. They also may show which areas need addressing (gait, strength, and/or balance). Based on your results, your health care provider may make recommendations to reduce your risk of falling. These may include:

Exercising to improve your strength and balance. You may be given instructions on specific exercises or be referred to a physical therapist.
Changing or reducing the dose of medicines that may be affecting your gait or balance. Some medicines have side effects that cause dizziness, drowsiness, or confusion.
Taking vitamin D to strengthen your bones.
Getting your vision checked by an eye doctor.
Looking at your footwear to see if any of your shoes might increase your risk of falling. You may be referred to a podiatrist (foot doctor).
Reviewing your home for potential hazards. These may include poor lighting, loose rugs, and/or cords on the floor. This review may be done by yourself, a partner, an occupational therapist, or other health care provider.

If you have questions about your results and/or recommendations, talk to your health care provider.

fecal occult blood test (fobt),"What is a fecal occult blood test?A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) looks at a sample of your stool (feces) to check for blood. Occult blood means that you can't see it with the naked eye. Blood in the stool means there is likely some kind of bleeding in the digestive tract. It may be caused by a variety of conditions, including:PolypsHemorrhoidsDiverticulosisUlcersColitis, a type of inflammatory bowel diseaseBlood in the stool may also be a sign of colorectal cancer, a type of cancer that starts in the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and the third most common cancer in men and in women. A fecal occult blood test is a screening test that may help find colorectal cancer early, when treatment is most effective.Other names: FOBT, stool occult blood, occult blood test, Hemoccult test, guaiac smear test, gFOBT, immunochemical FOBT, iFOBT; FIT
","What is it used for?A fecal occult blood test is used as an early screening test for colorectal cancer. It may also be used to diagnose other conditions that cause bleeding in the digestive tract.
","Why do I need a fecal occult blood test?The National Cancer Institute recommends that people get regular screenings for colorectal cancer starting at age 50. The screening may be a fecal occult test or another type of screening test. These tests may include:A stool DNA test. For this test, you can use an at-home test kit to take a sample of your stool and return it to a lab. It will be checked for blood and genetic changes that may be signs of cancer. If the test is positive, you will need a colonoscopy.A colonoscopy. This is a minor surgical procedure. You will first be given a mild sedative to help you relax. Then a health care provider will use a thin tube to look inside your colonThere are advantages and disadvantages to each type of test. Talk to your health care provider about which test is right for you.If your provider recommends a fecal occult blood test, you need to get it every year. A stool DNA test should be taken every 3 years, and a colonoscopy should be done every ten years.You may need screening more often if you have certain risk factors. These include:A family history of colorectal cancerCigarette smokingObesityExcessive alcohol use
","What happens during a fecal occult blood test?A fecal occult blood test is a noninvasive test that you can perform at home at your convenience. Your health care provider will give you a kit that includes instructions on how to do the test. There are two main types of fecal occult blood tests: the guaiac smear method (gFOBT) and the immunochemical method (iFOBT or FIT). Below are typical instructions for each test. Your instructions may vary slightly depending on the manufacturer of the test kit.For a guaiac smear test (gFOBT), you will most likely need to:Collect samples from three separate bowel movements.For each sample, collect the stool and store in a clean container. Make sure the sample does not mix in with urine or water from the toilet.Use the applicator from your test kit to smear some of the stool on the test card or slide, also included in your kit.Label and seal all your samples as directed.Mail the samples to your health care provider or lab.For a fecal immunochemical test (FIT), you will most likely need to:Collect samples from two or three bowel movements.Collect the sample from the toilet using the special brush or other device that was included in your kit.For each sample, use the brush or device to take the sample from the surface of the stool.Brush the sample onto a test card.Label and seal all your samples as directed.Mail the samples to your health care provider or lab.Be sure to follow all the instructions provided in your kit, and talk to your health care provider if you have any questions.

Your health care provider may ask you to avoid the following:Nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin for seven days prior to your test. If you take aspirin for heart problems, talk to your health care provider before stopping your medicine. Acetaminophen may be safe to use during this time, but check with your health care provider before taking it.More than 250 mg of vitamin C daily from supplements, fruit juices, or fruit for seven days prior to your test. Vitamin C can affect the chemicals in the test and cause a negative result even if there is blood present.Red meat, such as beef, lamb, and pork, for three days prior to the test. Traces of blood in these meats may cause a false-positive result.There are no special preparations or dietary restrictions for a fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
","Are there any risks to the test?There is no known risk to having a fecal occult blood test.
","What do the results mean?If your results are positive for either type of fecal occult blood test, it means you likely have bleeding somewhere in your digestive tract. But it does not necessarily mean you have cancer. Other conditions that may produce a positive result on a fecal occult blood test include ulcers, hemorrhoids, polyps, and benign tumors. If your test results are positive for blood, your health care provider will likely recommend additional testing, such as a colonoscopy, to figure out the exact location and cause of your bleeding. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

flu (influenza) test,"What is a flu (influenza) test?Influenza, known as the flu, is a respiratory infection caused by a virus. The flu virus usually spreads from person to person through coughing or sneezing. You can also get the flu by touching a surface that has the flu virus on it, and then touching your own nose or eyes.The flu is most common during certain times of the year, known as flu season. In the United States, flu season can begin as early as October and end as late as May. During each flu season, millions of Americans get the flu. Most people who get the flu will feel sick with muscle aches, fever, and other uncomfortable symptoms, but will recover within a week or so. For others, the flu can cause very serious illness, and even death.A flu test can help your health care provider figure out if you have the flu, so you can get treated earlier. Early treatment may help lessen the symptoms of the flu. There are a few different types of flu tests. The most common is called the rapid influenza antigen test, or rapid influenza diagnostic test. This type of test can provide results in less than half an hour, but is not as accurate as some other types of flu tests. More sensitive tests may require your health care provider to send samples to a specialized lab.Other names: rapid flu test, influenza antigen test, rapid influenza diagnostic test, RIDT, Flu PCR

fluoroscopy,"What is fluoroscopy?
Fluoroscopy is a type of x-ray that shows organs, tissues, or other internal structures moving in real time. Standard x-rays are like still photographs. Fluoroscopy is like a movie. It shows body systems in action. These include the cardiovascular (heart and blood vessels), digestive, and reproductive systems. The procedure can help your health care provider evaluate and diagnose a variety of conditions.
","What is it used for?
Fluoroscopy is used in many types of imaging procedures. The most common uses of fluoroscopy include:

Barium swallow or barium enema. In these procedures, fluoroscopy is used to show the movement of the gastrointestinal (digestive) tract.
Cardiac catheterization. In this procedure, fluoroscopy shows blood flowing through the arteries. It is used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions.
Placement of catheter or stent inside the body. Catheters are thin, hollow tubes. They are used to get fluids into the body or to drain excess fluids from the body. Stents are devices that help open narrow or blocked blood vessels. Fluoroscopy helps ensure proper placement of these devices.
Guidance in orthopedic surgery. Fluoroscopy may be used by a surgeon to help guide procedures such as joint replacement and fracture (broken bone) repair.
Hysterosalpingogram. In this procedure, fluoroscopy is used to provide images of a woman's reproductive organs.

","Why do I need fluoroscopy?
You may need a fluoroscopy if your provider wants to check the function of a particular organ, system, or other internal part of your body. You may also need fluoroscopy for certain medical procedures that require imaging.
","What happens during fluoroscopy?
Depending on the type of procedure, a fluoroscopy may be done at an outpatient radiology center or as part of your stay in a hospital. The procedure may include some or most of the following steps:

You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.
You will be given a lead shield or apron to wear over your pelvic area or another part of your body, depending on the type of fluoroscopy. The shield or apron provides protection from unnecessary radiation.
For certain procedures, you may be asked to drink a liquid containing contrast dye. Contrast dye is a substance that makes parts of your body show up more clearly on an x-ray.
If you are not asked to drink a liquid with the dye, you may be given the dye through an intravenous (IV) line or enema. An IV line will send the dye directly to your vein. An enema is procedure that flushes the dye into the rectum.
You will be positioned on an x-ray table. Depending on the type of procedure, you may be asked move your body in different positions or move a certain body part. You may also be asked to hold your breath for a brief period of time.
If your procedure involves getting a catheter, your provider will insert a needle in the appropriate body part. This may be your groin, elbow, or other site.
Your provider will use a special x-ray scanner to make the fluoroscopic images.
If a catheter was placed, your provider will remove it.

For certain procedures, such as those that involve injections into a joint or artery, you may first be given pain medicine and/or medicine to relax you.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Your preparation will depend on the type of fluoroscopy procedure. For some procedures, you don't need any special preparations. For others, you may be asked to avoid certain medicines and/or to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your provider will let you know if you need to do any special preparations.
","Are there any risks to the test?
You should not have a fluoroscopy procedure if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby.
For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation depends on the procedure, but fluoroscopy is not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.
If you will be having contrast dye, there is a small risk of an allergic reaction. Tell your provider if you have any allergies, especially to shellfish or iodine, or if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material.
","What do the results mean?
Your results will depend on what type of procedure you had. Several conditions and disorders can be diagnosed by fluoroscopy. Your provider may need to send your results to a specialist or do more tests to help make a diagnosis.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

follicle-stimulating hormone (fsh) levels test,"What is a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels test?This test measures the level of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in your blood. FSH is made by your pituitary gland, a small gland located underneath the brain. FSH plays an important role in sexual development and functioning.In women, FSH helps control the menstrual cycle and stimulates the growth of eggs in the ovaries. FSH levels in women change throughout the menstrual cycle, with the highest levels happening just before an egg is released by the ovary. This is known as ovulation.In men, FSH helps control the production of sperm. Normally, FSH levels in men do not change very much.In children, FSH levels are usually low until puberty, when levels begin to rise. In girls, it helps signal the ovaries to make estrogen. In boys, it helps signal the testes to make testosterone.Too much or too little FSH can cause a variety of problems, including infertility (the inability to get pregnant), menstrual difficulties in women, low sex drive in men, and early or delayed puberty in children.Other names: follitropin, FSH, follicle-stimulating hormone: serum
","What is it used for?FSH works closely with another hormone called luteinizing hormone to control sexual functions. So a luteinizing hormone test is often done along with an FSH test. These tests are used in different ways, depending on whether you are a woman, man, or child.In women, these tests are most often used to:Help find the cause of infertilityFind out if there is a problem with ovarian functionFind the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periodsConfirm the start of menopause, or perimenopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old. Perimenopause is the transition period before menopause. It can last for several years. FSH testing may be done towards the end of this transition.In men, these tests are most often used to:Help find the cause of infertilityFind the reason for a low sperm countFind out if there is a problem with the testiclesIn children, these tests are most often used to help diagnose early or delayed puberty.Puberty is considered early if it starts before age 9 in girls and before age 10 in boys.Puberty is considered delayed if it hasn't started by age 13 in girls and by age 14 in boys.
","Why do I need an FSH levels test?If you are a woman, you may need this test if:You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying.Your menstrual cycle is irregular.Your periods have stopped.

It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.Started menopause or are in perimenopauseAn ovarian tumorTurner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects sexual development in females. It often causes infertility.If you are a woman, low FSH levels may mean:Your ovaries are not making enough eggs.Your pituitary gland is not working correctly.You have a problem with your hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other important body functions.You are very underweight.If you are a man, high FSH levels may mean:Your testicles have been damaged due to chemotherapy, radiation, infection, or alcohol abuse.You have Klinefelter syndrome, a genetic disorder affects sexual development in males. It often causes infertility.If you are a man, low FSH levels may mean you have a disorder of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus.In children, high FSH levels, along with high levels of luteinizing hormone, may mean puberty is about to start or has already started. If this is happening before age 9 in a girl or before age 10 in a boy (precocious puberty), it may be a sign of:A disorder of the central nervous systemA brain injuryLow FSH and luteinizing hormone levels in children may be a sign of delayed puberty.

food allergy testing,"What is food allergy testing?A food allergy is a condition that causes your immune system to treat a normally harmless type of food as if was a dangerous virus, bacteria, or other infectious agent. The immune system response to a food allergy ranges from mild rashes to abdominal pain to a life-threatening complication called anaphylactic shock.Food allergies are more common in children than adults, affecting about 5 percent of children in the United States. Many children outgrow their allergies as they get older. Almost 90 percent of all food allergies are caused by the following foods:MilkSoyWheatEggsTree nuts (including almonds, walnuts, pecans, and cashews)FishShellfishPeanutsFor some people, even the tiniest amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger life-threatening symptoms. Of the foods listed above, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, and fish usually cause the most serious allergic reactions.Food allergy testing can find out whether you or your child has a food allergy. If a food allergy is suspected, your primary care provider or your child's provider will probably refer you to an allergist. An allergist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating allergies and asthma.Other names: IgE test, oral challenge test
","What is it used for?Food allergy testing is used to find out if you or your child has an allergy to a specific food. It may also be used to find out whether you have a true allergy or, instead, a sensitivity to a food.Food sensitivity, also called food intolerance, is often confused with a food allergy. The two conditions can have similar symptoms, but complications can be very different.A food allergy is an immune system reaction that can affect organs throughout the body. It can cause dangerous health conditions. Food sensitivity is usually much less serious. If you have a food sensitivity, your body can't properly digest a certain food, or a food bothers your digestive system. Symptoms of food sensitivity are mostly limited to digestive problems such as abdominal pain, nausea, gas, and diarrhea.Common food sensitivities include:Lactose, a type of sugar found in dairy products. It may be confused with a milk allergy.MSG, an additive found in many foodsGluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and other grains. It is sometimes confused with a wheat allergy. Gluten sensitivity and wheat allergies are also different from celiac disease. In celiac disease, your immune system damages your small intestine when you eat gluten. Some of the digestive symptoms can be similar, but celiac disease is not a food sensitivity or a food allergy.
","Why do I need food allergy testing?You or your child may need food allergy testing if you have certain risk factors and/or symptoms.Risk factors for food allergies include having:A family history of food allergiesOther food allergiesOther types of allergies, such as hay fever or eczemaAsthmaSymptoms of food allergies usually affect one or more of the following parts of the body:Skin. Skin symptoms include hives, tingling, itching, and redness. In babies with food allergies, the first symptom is often a rash.Digestive system. Symptoms include abdominal pain, metallic taste in the mouth, and swelling and/or itching of the tongue.Respiratory system (includes your lungs, nose, and throat). Symptoms include coughing, wheezing, nasal congestion, trouble breathing, and tightness in the chest.Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction that affects the entire body. Symptoms may include those listed above, as well as:Rapid swelling of the tongue, lips, and/or throatTightening of the airways and trouble breathingFast pulseDizzinessPale skinFeeling faintSymptoms can happen just seconds after someone is exposed to the allergic substance. Without quick medical treatment, anaphylactic shock can be fatal. If anaphylactic shock is suspected, you should call 911 immediately.If you or your child is at risk for anaphylactic shock, your allergist may prescribe a small device you can use in an emergency. The device, which is called an auto-injector, delivers a dose of epinephrine, a medicine that slows down the allergic reaction. You will still need to get medical help after using the device.
","What happens during food allergy testing?The testing may begin with your allergist performing a physical exam and asking about your symptoms. After that, he or she will perform one or more of the following tests:Oral challenge test. During this test, your allergist will give you or your child small amounts of the food suspected of causing the allergy. The food may be given in a capsule or with an injection. You'll be closely watched to see if there is an allergic reaction. Your allergist will provide immediate treatment if there is a reaction.Elimination diet. This is used to find which specific food or foods is causing the allergy. You'll start by eliminating all suspected foods from your child's or your diet. You will then add the foods back to the diet one at a time, looking for an allergic reaction. An elimination diet can't show whether your reaction is due to a food allergy or a food sensitivity. An elimination diet is not recommended for anyone at risk for a severe allergic reaction.Skin prick test. During this test, your allergist or other provider will place a small amount of the suspected food on the skin of your forearm or back. He or she will then prick the skin with a needle to allow a tiny amount of the food to get beneath the skin. If you get a red, itchy bump at the injection site, it usually means you are allergic to the food.Blood test. This test checks for substances called IgE antibodies in the blood. IgE antibodies are made in the immune system when you are exposed to an allergy-causing substance. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a food allergy test.
","Are there any risks to the test?An oral challenge test can cause a severe allergic reaction. That's why this test is only given under close supervision by an allergist.You may get an allergic reaction during an elimination diet. You should talk to your allergist about how to manage potential reactions.A skin prick test can bother the skin. If your skin is itchy or irritated after the test, your allergist may prescribe medicine to relieve the symptoms. In rare cases, a skin test can cause a severe reaction. So this test must also be done under close supervision by an allergist.There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If the results show that you or your child has a food allergy, the treatment is to avoid the food.There is no cure for food allergies, but eliminating the food from your diet should prevent allergic reactions.Avoiding allergy-causing foods can involve carefully reading labels on packaged goods. It also means you need to explain the allergy to anyone who prepares or serves food for you or your child. This includes people like waiters, babysitters, teachers, and cafeteria workers. But even if you are careful, you or your child may be exposed to the food by accident.If you or your child is at risk for a severe allergic reaction, your allergist will prescribe an epinephrine device you can use if accidentally exposed to the food. You'll be taught how to inject the device in your or your child's thigh.If you have questions about your results and/or how to manage allergic complications, talk to your allergist.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

free light chains,"What is a free light chains test?
Light chains are proteins made by plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. Plasma cells also make immunoglobulins (antibodies). Immunoglobulins help protect the body against illness and infections. Immunoglobulins are formed when light chains link up with heavy chains, another type of protein. When light chains link up with heavy chains, they are known as bound light chains.
Normally, plasma cells make a small amount of extra light chains that don't bind with heavy chains. They are instead released into the bloodstream. These unlinked chains are known as free light chains.
There are two types of light chains: lambda and kappa light chains. A free light chains test measures the amount of lambda and kappa free light chains in the blood. If the amount of free light chains is higher or lower than normal, it can mean you have a disorder of the plasma cells. These include multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells, and amyloidosis, a condition that causes a dangerous buildup of proteins in different organs and tissues.
Other names: free kappa/lambda ratio, kappa/lambda quantitative free light, freelite, kappa and lambda free light chains, immunoglobulin free light chains
","What is it used for?
A free light chains test is used to help diagnose or monitor plasma cell disorders.
","Why do I need a free light chains test?
You may need this test  if you have symptoms of a plasma cell disorder. Depending on which plasma disorder you may have and which organs are affected, your symptoms may include:

Bone pain
Fatigue
Numbness or tingling in arms and legs
Tongue swelling
Purple spots on the skin

","What happens during a free light chains test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a free light chains test.
","Are there any risks to a free light chains test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
Your results will show amounts for lambda and kappa free light chains. It will also provide a comparison between the two. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have a plasma cell disorder, such as:

Multiple myeloma
Amyloidosis
MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance). This is a condition in which you have abnormal protein levels. It often causes no problems or symptoms, but sometimes it develops into multiple myeloma.
Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), a cancer of the white blood cells. It's a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

fungal culture test,"What is a fungal culture test?A fungal culture test helps diagnose fungal infections, a health problem caused by exposure to fungi (more than one fungus). A fungus is a type of germ that lives in air, soil and plants, and even on our own bodies. There are more than a million different kinds of fungi. Most are harmless, but a few types of fungi can cause infections. There are two main types of fungal infections: superficial (affecting parts of the outer body) and systemic (affecting systems inside the body).Superficial fungal infections are very common. They can affect the skin, genital area, and nails. Superficial infections include athlete's foot, vaginal yeast infections, and ringworm, which is not a worm but a fungus that can cause a circular rash on the skin. While not serious, superficial fungal infections can cause itchy, scaly rashes and other uncomfortable conditions.Systemic fungal infections can affect your lungs, blood, and other systems in your body. These infections can be quite serious. Many of the more harmful fungi affect people with weakened immune systems. Others, such as one called sporothrix schenckii, usually affect people who work with soil and plants, though the fungi can infect people through an animal bite or scratch, often from a cat. A sporothrix infection may cause skin ulcers, lung disease, or joint problems.Both superficial and systemic fungal infections can be diagnosed with a fungal culture test.
","What is it used for?A fungal culture test is used to find out whether you have a fungal infection. The test may help identify specific fungi, guide treatment, or determine if a fungal infection treatment is working.
","Why do I need a fungal culture test?Your health care provider may order a fungal culture test if you have symptoms of a fungal infection. The symptoms vary depending on the type of infection. Symptoms of a superficial fungal infection include:Red rashItchy skinItching or discharge in the vagina (symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection)White patches inside the mouth (symptoms of a mouth yeast infection, called thrush)Hard or brittle nailsSymptoms of a more serious, systemic fungal infection include:FeverMuscle achesHeadachesChillsNauseaFast heartbeat
","What happens during a fungal culture test?Fungi can occur in different places in the body. Fungal culture tests are performed where fungi is likely to be present. The most common types of fungal tests and their uses are listed below.Skin or nail scrapingUsed to diagnose superficial skin or nail infectionsTest procedure:Your health care provider will use a special tool to take a small sample of your skin or nailsSwab testUsed to diagnose yeast infections in your mouth or vagina. It may also be used to diagnose certain skin infections.Test procedure:Your health care provider will use a special swab to gather tissue or fluid from mouth, vagina, or from an open woundBlood TestUsed to detect the presence of fungi in the blood. Blood tests are often used to diagnose more serious fungal infections.Test procedure:A health care professional will need a blood sample. The sample is most often taken from a vein in your arm.Urine TestUsed to diagnose more serious infections and sometimes to help diagnose a vaginal yeast infectionTest procedure:You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a container, as instructed by your health care provider.Sputum CultureSputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva.Used to help diagnose fungal infections in the lungsTest procedure:You may be asked to cough up sputum into a special container as instructed by your providerAfter your sample is collected, it will be sent to a lab for analysis. You may not get your results right away. Your fungal culture needs to have enough fungi for your health care provider to make a diagnosis. While many types of fungi grow within a day or two, others can take a few weeks. The amount of time depends on the type of infection you have.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations to test for a fungal infection.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having any of the different types of fungal culture tests.

gamma-glutamyl transferase (ggt) test,"What is a gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test?
A gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test measures the amount of GGT in the blood. GGT is an enzyme found throughout the body, but it is mostly found in the liver. When the liver is damaged, GGT may leak into the bloodstream. High levels of GGT in the blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes that carry bile in and out of the liver. Bile is a fluid made by the liver. It is important for digestion.
A GGT test can't diagnose the specific cause of liver disease. So it is usually done along with or after other liver function tests, most often an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test. ALP is another type of liver enzyme. It's often used to help diagnose bone disorders as well as liver disease.
Other names: gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, GGTP, Gamma-GT, GTP
","What is it used for?
A GGT test is most often used to:

Help diagnose liver disease
Figure out if liver damage is due to liver disease or a bone disorder
Check for blockages in the bile ducts
Screen for or monitor alcohol use disorder

","Why do I need a GGT test?
You may need a GGT test if you have symptoms of liver disease. Symptoms include:

Fatigue
Weakness
Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow
Loss of appetite
Abdominal pain or swelling
Nausea and vomiting

You may also need this test if you had abnormal results on an ALP test and/or other liver function tests.
","What happens during a GGT test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a GGT test.
","Are there any risks to a GGT test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show higher than normal levels of GGT, it may be a sign of liver damage. The damage may be due to one of the following conditions:

Hepatitis
Cirrhosis
Alcohol use disorder
Pancreatitis
Diabetes
Congestive heart failure
Side effect of a drug. Certain medicines can cause liver damage in some people.

The results can't show which condition you have, but it can help show how much liver damage you have. Usually, the higher the level of GGT, the greater the level of damage to the liver.
If your results show you have low or normal levels of GGT, it means you probably don't have liver disease.
Your results may also be compared with the results of an ALP test. ALP tests help diagnose bone disorders. Together your results may show one of the following:

High levels of ALP and high levels of GGT means your symptoms are likely due to liver disorder and not a bone disorder.
High levels of ALP and low or normal GGT means it's more likely you have a bone disorder.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

glaucoma tests,"What are glaucoma tests?Glaucoma tests are a group of tests that help diagnose glaucoma, a disease of the eye that can cause vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma happens when fluid builds up in the front part of the eye. The extra fluid causes an increase in eye pressure. Increased eye pressure can damage the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries information from the eye to the brain. When the optic nerve is damaged, it can lead to serious vision problems.There are several types of glaucoma. The main types are:Open-angle glaucoma, also called primary open-angle glaucoma. This is the most common type of glaucoma. It happens when the fluid in the eye doesn't drain properly from the eye's drainage canals. The fluid gets backed up in the canals like a clogged sink drain that gets backed up with water. This causes an increase in eye pressure. Open-angle glaucoma develops slowly, over a period of months or years. Most people don't have any symptoms or vision changes at first. Open-angle glaucoma usually affects both eyes at the same time.Closed-angle glaucoma, also called angle-closure or narrow-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma isn't common in the United States. It usually affects one eye at a time. In this type of glaucoma, drainage canals in the eyes get covered up, as if a stopper was put over a drain. Closed-angle glaucoma can be either acute or chronic.Acute closed-angle glaucoma causes a rapid increase in eye pressure. It is a medical emergency. People with acute closed-angle glaucoma can lose vision in a matter of hours if the condition is not treated promptly.Chronic closed-angle glaucoma develops slowly. In many cases, there are no symptoms until damage is severe.
","What are they used for?Glaucoma tests are used to diagnose glaucoma. If glaucoma is diagnosed early, you may be able to take steps to prevent vision loss.
","Why do I need glaucoma testing?If you have open-angle glaucoma, you may not have any symptoms until the disease becomes severe. So it's important to be tested if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk for glaucoma if you have a family history of glaucoma or if you are:Aged 60 or older. Glaucoma is much more common in older people.Hispanic and aged 60 or older. Hispanics in this age group have a higher risk of glaucoma compared with older adults with European ancestry.African American. Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in African Americans.Asian. People of Asian descent are at higher risk for getting closed-angle glaucoma.Closed-angle glaucoma can cause sudden and severe symptoms. If not treated promptly, it can cause blindness. Symptoms include:Sudden blurring of visionSevere eye painRed eyesColored halos around lightsNausea and vomitingIf you have any of these symptoms, seek medical help right away.
","What happens during a glaucoma test?Glaucoma is usually diagnosed with a group of tests, commonly known as a comprehensive eye exam. These exams are most often done by an ophthalmologist. An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in eye health and in treating and preventing eye disease.A comprehensive eye exam includes:Tonometry. In a tonometry test, you will sit in an exam chair next to a special microscope called a slit lamp. Your ophthalmologist or other health care provider will put drops in your eyes to numb them. Then you'll rest your chin and forehead onto the slit lamp. While you are leaning into the slit lamp, your provider will use a device on your eye called a tonometer. The device measures eye pressure. You will feel a small puff of air, but it won't hurt.Pachymetry. As in a tonometry test, you'll first get drops to numb your eye. Your provider will then use a small device on your eye called a pachymeter. This device measures the thickness of your cornea. The cornea is the eye's outer layer that covers the iris (colored part of the eye) and the pupil. A thin cornea may put you at higher risk for getting glaucoma.Perimetry, also known as a visual field test, measures your peripheral (side) vision. During perimetry, you'll be asked to look straight ahead at a screen. A light or image will move in from one side of the screen. You'll let the provider know when you see this light or image while still looking straight ahead.Dilated eye test. In this test, your provider will put drops in your eyes that widen (dilate) your pupils. Your provider will use a device with a light and magnifying lens to look at your optic nerve and check for damage.Gonioscopy. In this test, your provider will put drops in your eyes to both numb and dilate them. Then your provider will put a special hand-held contact lens on the eye. The lens has a mirror on it to let the doctor view the inside of the eye from different directions. It can show if the angle between the iris and cornea is too wide (a possible sign of open-angle glaucoma) or too narrow (a possible sign of closed-angle glaucoma).
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a glaucoma test?While your eyes are dilated, your vision may be blurred and you'll be extra sensitive to light. These effects can last for several hours and vary in severity. To protect your eyes from bright light, you should bring sunglasses to wear after the appointment. You should also make arrangements for someone to drive you home, as your vision may be too impaired for safe driving.
","Are there any risks to the tests?There is no risk to having glaucoma testing. Some of the tests may feel a bit uncomfortable. Also, dilation can temporarily blur your vision.
","What do the results mean?Your ophthalmologist will look at the results of all your glaucoma tests to figure out whether you have glaucoma. If the doctor determines you have glaucoma, he or she may recommend one or more of the following treatments:Medicine to lower eye pressure or cause the eye to make less fluid. Some medicines are taken as eye drops; others are in pill form.Surgery to create a new opening for fluid to leave the eye.Drainage tube implant, another type of surgery. In this procedure, a flexible plastic tube is placed in the eye to help drain excess fluid.Laser surgery to remove excess fluid from the eye. Laser surgery is usually done in an ophthalmologist's office or outpatient surgery center. You may need to continue taking glaucoma medicines after laser surgery.If you've been diagnosed with glaucoma, your ophthalmologist will probably monitor your vision on a regular basis.
","Is there anything else I need to know about glaucoma tests?While glaucoma treatments won't cure the disease or restore vision you have already lost, treatment can prevent additional vision loss. If diagnosed and treated early, most people with glaucoma will not have significant vision loss.

globulin test,"What is a globulin test?Globulins are a group of proteins in your blood. They are made in your liver by your immune system. Globulins play an important role in liver function, blood clotting, and fighting infection. There are four main types of globulins. They are called alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma. Just as there are different types of globulins, there are different types of globulin tests. These include:Total protein test. This blood test measures two types of proteins: globulin and albumin. If protein levels are low, it can mean that you have liver or kidney disease.Serum protein electrophoresis. This blood test measures gamma globulins and other proteins in your blood. It can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including disorders of the immune system and a type of cancer called multiple myeloma.Other names for globulin tests: Serum globulin electrophoresis, total protein

glomerular filtration rate (gfr) test,"What is a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) test?A glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a blood test that checks how well your kidneys are working. Your kidneys have tiny filters called glomeruli. These filters help remove waste and excess fluid from the blood. A GFR test estimates how much blood passes through these filters each minute.A GFR can be measured directly, but it is a complicated test, requiring specialized providers. So GFR is most often estimated using a test called an estimated GFR or eGFR. To get an estimate, your provider will use a method known as a GFR calculator. A GFR calculator is a type of mathematical formula that estimates the rate of filtration using some or all of the following information about you:The results of a blood test that measures creatinine, a waste product filtered by the kidneysAgeWeightHeightGenderRaceThe eGFR is a simple test that can provide very accurate results.Other names: estimated GFR, eGFR, calculated glomerular filtration rate, cGFR
","What is it used for?A GFR test is used to help diagnose kidney disease at an early stage, when it is most treatable. GFR may also be used to monitor people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other conditions that cause kidney damage. These include diabetes and high blood pressure.

glucose in urine test,"What is a glucose in urine test?A glucose in urine test measures the amount of glucose in your urine. Glucose is a type of sugar. It is your body's main source of energy. A hormone called insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells. If too much glucose gets into the blood, the extra glucose will be eliminated through your urine. A urine glucose test can be used to help determine if blood glucose levels are too high, which may be a sign of diabetes.Other names: urine sugar test; urine glucose test; glucosuria test
","What is it used for?A glucose in urine test may be part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. Urinalysis is often included as part of a routine exam. A glucose in urine test may also be used to screen for diabetes. However, a urine glucose test is not as accurate as a blood glucose test. It may be ordered if blood glucose testing is difficult or not possible. Some people can't get blood drawn because their veins are too small or too scarred from repeated punctures. Other people avoid blood tests due to extreme anxiety or fear of needles.
","Why do I need a glucose in urine test?You may get a glucose in urine test as part of your regular checkup or if you have symptoms of diabetes and cannot take a blood glucose test. Symptoms of diabetes include:Increased thirstMore frequent urinationBlurred visionFatigueYou may also need a urinalysis, which includes a glucose in urine test, if you are pregnant. If high levels of glucose in urine are found, it may indicate gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is form of diabetes that happens only during pregnancy. Blood glucose testing can be used to confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Most pregnant women are tested for gestational diabetes with a blood glucose test, between their 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy.
","What happens during a glucose in urine test?Your health care provider will need to collect a sample of your urine. During your office visit, you will receive a container in which to collect the urine and special instructions to ensure the sample is sterile.

gonorrhea test,"What is a gonorrhea test?Gonorrhea is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected person. It can also be spread from a pregnant woman to her baby during childbirth. Gonorrhea can infect both men and women. It is most common in young people, aged 15–24.Many people with gonorrhea don't know they have it. So they may spread it to others without knowing it. Men with gonorrhea may have some symptoms. But women often have no symptoms or mistake gonorrhea symptoms for a bladder or vaginal infection.A gonorrhea test looks for the presence of gonorrhea bacteria in your body. The disease can be cured with antibiotics. But if it's not treated, gonorrhea can lead to infertility and other serious health problems. In women, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is a pregnancy that develops outside the uterus, where a baby can't survive. If not treated promptly, ectopic pregnancy can be fatal to the mother.In men, gonorrhea can cause painful urination and scarring of the urethra. The urethra is a tube that allows urine to flow from the bladder to the outside of the body and also carries semen. In men, this tube runs through the penis.Other names: GC test, gonorrhea DNA probe test, gonorrhea nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT)
","What is it used for?A gonorrhea test is used to find out whether you have a gonorrhea infection. It's sometimes done along with a test for chlamydia, another type of sexually transmitted disease (STD). Gonorrhea and chlamydia have similar symptoms, and the two STDs often occur together.
","Why do I need a gonorrhea test?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends yearly gonorrhea tests for all sexually active women under the age of 25. It is also recommended for sexually active older women with certain risk factors. Risk factors include:Having multiple sex partnersPrevious gonorrhea infectionHaving other STDsHaving a sex partner with an STDNot using condoms consistently or correctlyThe CDC recommends yearly testing for men who have sex with men. Testing is not recommended for heterosexual men with no symptoms.Both men and women should be tested if they have symptoms of gonorrhea.Symptoms for women include:Vaginal dischargePain during sexBleeding between periodsPain when urinatingAbdominal painSymptoms for men include:Pain or tenderness in the testiclesSwollen scrotumPain when urinatingWhite, yellow, or greenish discharge from the penisIf you are pregnant, you may get a gonorrhea test early in your pregnancy. A pregnant woman with gonorrhea can pass the infection to her baby during delivery. Gonorrhea can cause blindness and other serious, sometimes life-threatening, complications in infants. If you are pregnant and have gonorrhea, you can be treated with an antibiotic that is safe for you and your child.
","What happens during a gonorrhea test?If you are a woman, a sample may be taken from your cervix. For this procedure, you will lie on your back on an exam table, with your knees bent. You will rest your feet in supports called stirrups. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or plastic spatula to collect the sample.If you are a man, your provider may take a swab from the opening of your urethra.For both men and women, a sample may be taken from a suspected area of infection, such as the mouth or rectum. Urine tests are also used for both men and women.Some gonorrhea tests can be done with an at-home STD test kit. If your health care provider recommends at-home testing, be sure to follow all directions carefully.Your health care provider may order tests for other STDs when you get a gonorrhea test. These may include tests for chlamydia, syphilis, and/or HIV.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?If you are a woman, you may be asked to avoid using douches or vaginal creams for 24 hours before your test. For a urine test, both men and women should not urinate 1–2 hours before the sample is collected.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having a gonorrhea test. Women may feel some mild discomfort during a swab test of the cervix. Afterward, you may have a little bleeding or other vaginal discharge.
","What do the results mean?Your results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal.Negative/Normal: No gonorrhea bacteria were found. If you have certain symptoms, you may get additional STD tests to find out the cause.Positive/Abnormal: You are infected with the gonorrhea bacteria. You will be treated with antibiotics to cure the infection. Be sure to take all the required doses. Antibiotic treatment should stop the infection, but some types of gonorrhea bacteria are becoming resistant (less effective or ineffective) to certain antibiotics. If your symptoms don't improve after treatment, your health care provider may order a ""susceptibility test."" A susceptibility test is used to help determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating your infection.Regardless of your treatment, be sure to let your sex partner know if you have tested positive for gonorrhea. That way, he or she can be tested and treated promptly.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a gonorrhea test?The best way to prevent infection with gonorrhea or other STD is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection by:Being in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDsUsing condoms correctly every time you have sex
"
gram stain,"What is a Gram stain?
A Gram stain is a test that checks for bacteria at the site of a suspected infection or in certain body fluids, such as blood or urine. These sites include the throat, lungs, and genitals, and in skin wounds.
There are two main categories of bacterial infections: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The categories are diagnosed based on the how the bacteria reacts to the Gram stain. A Gram stain is colored purple. When the stain combines with bacteria in a sample, the bacteria will either stay purple or turn pink or red. If the bacteria stays purple, they are Gram-positive. If the bacteria turns pink or red, they are Gram-negative. The two categories cause different types of infections:

Gram-positive infections include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), strep infections, and toxic shock.
Gram-negative infections include salmonella, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and gonorrhea.

A Gram stain may also be used to diagnose fungal infections.
Other names: Gram's stain
","What is it used for?
A Gram stain is most often used to find out if you have a bacterial infection. If you do, the test will show if your infection is Gram-positive or Gram-negative.
","Why do I need a Gram stain?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a bacterial infection. Pain, fever, and fatigue are common symptoms of many bacterial infections. Other symptoms will depend on the type of infection you have and where in the body it is located.
","What happens during a Gram stain?
Your health care provider will need to take a sample from the site of a suspected infection or from certain body fluids, depending on what type of infection you may have. The most common types of Gram stain tests are listed below.
Wound sample:

A provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.

Blood test:

A provider will take a sample of blood from a vein in your arm.

Urine test:

You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.

Throat culture:

Your health care provider will insert a special swab into your mouth to take a sample from the back of the throat and tonsils.

Sputum culture. Sputum is a thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. It is different from spit or saliva.

Your health care provider will ask you to cough up sputum into a special cup, or a special swab may be used to take a sample from your nose.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a Gram stain.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no risk to having a swab, sputum, or urine test.  
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
Your sample will be placed on a slide and treated with the Gram stain. A laboratory professional will examine the slide under a microscope. If no bacteria were found, it means you probably don't have a bacterial infection or there weren't enough bacteria in the sample.
If bacteria were found, it will have certain qualities may provide important information about your infection:

If the bacteria was colored purple, it means you likely have a Gram-positive infection.
If the bacteria was colored pink or red, it means you likely have a Gram-negative infection.

Your results will also include information about the shape of the bacteria in your sample. Most bacteria are either round (known as cocci) or rod-shaped (known as bacilli). The shape can provide more information about the type of infection you have.
Although your results may not identify the exact type of bacteria in your sample, they can help your provider get closer to finding out what's causing your illness and how best to treat it. You may need more tests, such as a bacteria culture, to confirm what type of bacteria it is.
Gram stain results may also show whether you have a fungal infection. The results may show what category of fungal infection you have: yeast or mold. But you may need more tests to find out which specific fungal infection you have.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a Gram stain?
If you are diagnosed with a bacterial infection, you will probably be prescribed antibiotics. It's important to take your medicine as prescribed, even if your symptoms are mild. This can prevent your infection from getting worse and causing serious complications.
"
haptoglobin (hp) test,"What is a haptoglobin (HP) test?
This test measures the amount of haptoglobin in the blood. Haptoglobin is a protein made by your liver. It attaches to a certain type of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Most hemoglobin is located inside red blood cells, but small amounts circulate in the bloodstream. Haptoglobin binds to hemoglobin in the bloodstream. Together, the two proteins are known as the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex. This complex is quickly cleared from the bloodstream and removed from the body by your liver.
When red blood cells are damaged, they release more hemoglobin into the bloodstream. That means more of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex will be cleared from the body. The haptoglobin may leave the body faster than the liver can make it. This causes your haptoglobin blood levels to drop. If your haptoglobin levels are too low, it may be a sign of a disorder of the red blood cells, such as anemia.
Other names: hemoglobin-binding protein, HPT, Hp
","What is it used for?
A haptoglobin test is most often used to diagnose hemolytic anemia. Hemolytic anemia is a disorder that happens when your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be replaced. This test may also be used to see if another type of anemia or another blood disorder is causing your symptoms.
","Why do I need a haptoglobin test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of anemia. These include:

Fatigue
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
Rapid heart rate
Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow
Dark colored urine

You may also need this test if you've had a blood transfusion. The test may be done with another test called direct anti-globulin. The results of these tests can show if you've had a bad reaction to the transfusion.
","What happens during a haptoglobin test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a haptoglobin test.
","Are there any risks to a haptoglobin test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show that your haptoglobin levels are lower than normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Hemolytic anemia
Liver disease
Reaction to a transfusion

Your health care provider may order other blood tests to help make a diagnosis. These include:

Reticulocyte Count
Hemoglobin Test
Hematocrit Test
Lactate Dehydrogenase Test
Blood Smear
Complete Blood Count

These tests may be done at the same time or after your haptoglobin test.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a haptoglobin test?
High haptoglobin levels may be a sign of an inflammatory disease. Inflammatory diseases are disorders of the immune system that can cause serious health problems. But haptoglobin testing is not usually used to diagnose or monitor conditions related to high haptoglobin levels.

hearing tests for adults,"What are hearing tests?Hearing tests measure how well you are able to hear. Normal hearing happens when sound waves travel into your ear, causing your eardrum to vibrate. The vibration moves the waves farther into the ear, where it triggers nerve cells to send sound information to your brain. This information is translated into the sounds you hear.Hearing loss happens when there is a problem with one or more parts of the ear, the nerves inside the ear, or the part of the brain that controls hearing. There are three main types of hearing loss:Sensorineurual (also called nerve deafness). This type of hearing loss is caused by a problem with the structure of the ear and/or with the nerves that control hearing. It may be present at birth or show up late in life. Sensorineural hearing loss is usually permanent. This type of hearing loss ranges from mild (the inability to hear certain sounds) to profound (the inability to hear any sounds).Conductive. This type of hearing loss is caused by a blockage of sound transmission into the ear. It can occur at any age, but it's most common in infants and young children and is often caused by ear infections or fluid in the ears. Conductive hearing loss is usually mild, temporary, and treatable.Mixed, a combination of both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss.Hearing loss is common in older adults. About one-third of adults over the age of 65 have some hearing loss, most often the sensorineural type. If you are diagnosed with hearing loss, there are steps you can take that may help treat or manage the condition.Other names: audiometry, audiography, audiogram, sound test
","What are they used for?Hearing tests are used to find out whether or not you have a hearing problem and, if so, how serious it is.
","Why do I need a hearing test?You may need a hearing test if you have symptoms of hearing loss. These include:Trouble understanding what other people are saying, especially in a noisy environmentNeeding to ask people to repeat themselvesTrouble hearing high-pitched soundsNeeding to turn up the volume on the TV or music playerA ringing sound in your ears
","What happens during a hearing test?Your hearing test may be done by a primary health care provider or one of the following types of providers:An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing lossAn otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throat.There are several types of hearing tests. Most tests check for your response to tones or words delivered at different pitches, volumes, and/or noise environments. These are called sound tests. Common sound tests include:Acoustic Reflex Measures, also called middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR), test how well the ear responds to loud sounds. In normal hearing, a tiny muscle inside the ear tightens when you hear loud noises. This is called the acoustic reflex. It happens without you knowing it. During the test:The audiologist or other provider will place a soft rubber tip inside the ear.A series of loud sounds will be sent through the tips and recorded onto a machine.The machine will show when or if the sound has triggered a reflex.If hearing loss is bad, the sound may have to be very loud to trigger a reflex, or it may not trigger the reflex at all.Pure-tone test, also known as audiometry. During this test:You will put on headphones.A series of tones will be sent to your headphones.The audiologist or other provider will change the pitch and loudness of the tones at different points during the test. At some points, the tones may be barely audible.The provider will ask you to respond whenever you hear the tones. Your response may be to raise your hand or press a button.The test helps find the quietest sounds you can hear at different pitches.Tuning fork tests. A tuning fork is a two-pronged metal device that makes a tone when it vibrates. During the test:The audiologist or other provider will place the tuning fork behind your ear or on top of your head.The provider will hit the fork so that it makes a tone.You'll be asked to tell the provider whenever you hear the tone at different volumes, or if you heard the sound in your left ear, right ear, or both equally.Depending on where the fork is placed and how you respond, the test can show if there is hearing loss in one or both ears. It can also show which type of hearing loss you have (conductive or sensorineural).Speech and word recognition tests can show how well you can hear spoken language. During the test:You will put on headphones.The audiologist will talk to you through your headphones, and ask you to repeat a series of simple words, spoken at different volumes.The provider will record the softest speech you are able to hear.Some of the testing may be done in a noisy environment, because many people with hearing loss have trouble understanding speech in loud places.Another type test, called tympanometry, checks for how well your eardrum moves.During a tympanometry test:The audiologist or other provider will place a small device inside the ear canal.The device will push air into the ear, making the eardrum move back and forth.A machine records the movement on graphs called tympanograms.The test helps find out if there is an ear infection or other problems such as fluid or wax buildup, or a hole or tear in the eardrum.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a hearing test?You don't need any special preparations for a hearing test.
","Are there any risks to hearing tests?There is no risk to having a hearing test.
","What do the results mean?Your results may show if you have a hearing loss, and whether the hearing loss is sensorineural or conductive.If you are diagnosed with sensorineural hearing loss, your results may show that the hearing loss is:Mild: you can't hear certain sounds, such as tones that are too high or too low.Moderate: you can't hear many sounds, such as speech in a noisy environment.Severe: you can't hear most sounds.Profound: you can't hear any sounds.Treatment and management of sensorineural hearing loss will depend on serious it is.If you are diagnosed with conductive hearing loss, your provider may recommend medicine or surgery, depending on the cause of the loss.If you have questions about the results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about hearing tests?
Even mild hearing loss can make it difficult to understand normal speech. Because of this, many older adults will avoid social situations, leading to isolation and depression. Treating hearing loss can help prevent these problems. While hearing loss in older adults is usually permanent, there are ways to manage the condition. Treatment options include:

Hearing aids. A hearing aid is a device that's worn either behind or inside the ear. A hearing aid amplifies (makes louder) sound. Some hearing aids have more advanced functions. Your audiologist can recommend the best option for you.
Cochlear implants. This is a device that's implanted surgically in the ear. It's usually used in people with more severe hearing loss and who don't get much benefit from using a hearing aid. Cochlear implants send sound directly to the hearing nerve.
Surgery. Some types of hearing loss can be treated with surgery. These include problems with the eardrum or in the tiny bones inside the ear.

hearing tests for children,"What are hearing tests for children?These tests measure how well your child is able to hear. Although hearing loss can occur at any age, hearing problems in infancy and early childhood can have serious consequences. That's because normal hearing is essential for language development in babies and toddlers. Even a temporary hearing loss can make it harder for a child to understand spoken language and learn to speak.Normal hearing happens when sound waves travel into your ear, causing your eardrum to vibrate.

Sound tests check for response to tones or words delivered at different pitches, volumes, and/or noise environments.Auditory brainstorm (ABR) test. This checks for sensorineural hearing loss. It measures how the brain responds to sound. It is most often used to test infants, including newborns. During this test:The audiologist or other provider will place electrodes on the scalp and behind each ear. The electrodes are connected to a computer.Tiny earphones will be placed inside the ears.Clicks and tones will be sent to the earphones.The electrodes measure the brain's response to the sounds and will display the results on the computer.Otoacoustic emissions (OAE) test.

heavy metal blood test,"What is a heavy metal blood test?A heavy metal blood test is a group of tests that measure the levels of potentially harmful metals in the blood. The most common metals tested for are lead, mercury, arsenic, and cadmium. Metals that are less commonly tested for include copper, zinc, aluminum, and thallium. Heavy metals are found naturally in the environment, certain foods, medicines, and even in water.Heavy metals can get in your system in different ways. You might breathe them in, eat them, or absorb them through your skin. If too much metal gets into your body, it can cause heavy metal poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning can lead to serious health problems. These include organ damage, behavioral changes, and difficulties with thinking and memory. The specific symptoms and how it will affect you, depend on the type of metal and how much of it is in your system.Other names: heavy metals panel, toxic metals, heavy metal toxicity test
","What is it used for?Heavy metal testing is used to find out if you have been exposed to certain metals, and how much of the metal is in your system.
","Why do I need a heavy metal blood test?Your health care provider may order a heavy metal blood test if you have symptoms of heavy metal poisoning. The symptoms depend on the type of metal and how much exposure there was.Your symptoms may include:Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal painDiarrheaTingling in the hands and feetShortness of breathChillsWeaknessSome children under the age of 6 may need to be tested for lead because they have a higher risk for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is a very serious type of heavy metal poisoning. It is especially dangerous for children because their brains are still developing, so they are more vulnerable to brain damage from lead poisoning. In the past, lead was frequently used in paint and other household products. It is still used in some products today.Young children get exposed to lead by touching surfaces with lead, then putting their hands in their mouths. Children living in older houses and/or living in poorer conditions may be at an even higher risk because their environments often contain more lead. Even low levels of lead can cause permanent brain damage and behavioral disorders. Your child's pediatrician may recommend lead testing for your child, based on your living environment and your child's symptoms.
","What happens during a heavy metal blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?Some fish and shellfish contain high levels of mercury, so you should avoid eating seafood for 48 hours before being tested.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your heavy metal blood test shows a high level of metal, you will need to completely avoid exposure to that metal. If that doesn't reduce enough metal in your blood, your health care provider may recommend chelation therapy. Chelation therapy is a treatment where you take a pill or get an injection that works to remove excess metals from your body.If your levels of heavy metal are low, but you still have symptoms of exposure, your health care provider will likely order more tests. Some heavy metals don't stay in the bloodstream very long. These metals may stay longer in urine, hair, or other body tissues. So you may need to take a urine test or provide a sample of your hair, fingernail, or other tissue for analysis.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

Many people with H. pylori will never have symptoms of infection. But for others, the bacteria can cause a variety of digestive disorders. These include gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), peptic ulcers (sores in the stomach, small intestine, or esophagus), and certain types of stomach cancer.There are different ways to test for an H. pylori infection. They include blood, stool, and breath tests. If you are having digestive symptoms, testing and treatment may help prevent serious complications.Other names: H. pylori stool antigen, H. pylori breath tests, urea breath test, rapid urease test (RUT) for H. pylori, H. pylori culture
","What are they used for?H. pylori tests are most often used to:Look for H. pylori bacteria in the digestive tractFind out if your digestive symptoms are caused by an H. pylori infectionFind out if treatment for an H. pylori infection has worked
","Why do I need an H. pylori test?You may need testing if you have symptoms of a digestive disorder. Since gastritis and ulcers both inflame the lining of the stomach, they share many of the same symptoms. They include:Abdominal painBloatingNausea and vomitingDiarrheaLoss of appetiteWeight lossAn ulcer is a more serious condition than gastritis, and symptoms are often more severe. Treating gastritis in early stages may help prevent the development of an ulcer or other complications.
","What happens during H. pylori testing?
There are different ways to test for H. pylori. Your health care provider may order one or more of the following types of tests.
Blood test

Checks for antibodies (infection-fighting cells) to H. pylori
Test procedure:


A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.
After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.



Breath test, also known as a urea breath test

Checks for infection by measuring certain substances in your breath
Test procedure:


You will provide a sample of your breath by breathing into a collection bag.
After that, you will swallow a pill or liquid containing a harmless radioactive material.
You will provide another sample of your breath.
Your provider will compare the two samples. If the second sample has higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, it is a sign of an H. pylori infection.



Stool tests.Your provider may order a stool antigen or a stool culture test.

A stool antigen test looks for antigens to H. pylori in your stool. Antigens are substances that trigger an immune response.
A stool culture test looks for H. pylori bacteria in the stool.
Samples for both types of stool tests are collected in the same way. Sample collection usually includes the following steps:


Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves.
Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab.
If collecting a sample from a baby, line the baby's diaper with plastic wrap.
Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample.
Seal and label the container.
Remove the gloves, and wash your hands.
Return the container to your health care provider.



Endoscopy. If other tests did not provide enough information for a diagnosis, your provider may order a procedure called an endoscopy. An endoscopy allows your provider to look at your esophagus (the tube that links your mouth and stomach), the lining of your stomach, and part of your small intestine. During the procedure:

You will lie down on an operating table on your back or side.
You will be given medicine to help you relax and prevent you from feeling pain during the procedure.
Your provider will insert a thin tube, called an endoscope, into your mouth and throat. The endoscope has a light and camera on it. This allows the provider to get a good view of your internal organs.
Your provider may take a biopsy (removal of a small sample of tissue) to examine after the procedure.
After the procedure, you will be observed for an hour or two while the medicine wears off.
You may be drowsy for a while, so plan to have someone drive you home.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for testing?You don't need any special preparation for an H. pylori blood test.For breath, stool, and endoscopy tests, you may need to stop taking certain medicines for as long as two weeks to a month before testing. Be sure to talk with your health care provider about all medicines you are currently taking.For an endoscopy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for about 12 hours before the procedure.
","Are there any risks to testing?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.There is no known risk to having breath or stool tests.During an endoscopy, you may feel some discomfort when the endoscope is inserted, but serious complications are rare. There is a very small risk of getting a tear in your intestine. If you had a biopsy, there is a small risk of bleeding at the site. Bleeding usually stops without treatment.
","What do the results mean?If your results were negative, it means you probably don't have an H. pylori infection. Your provider may order more tests to find out the cause of your symptoms.If your results were positive, it means you have an H. pylori infection. H. pylori infections are treatable. Your health care provider will probably prescribe a combination of antibiotics and other medicines to treat the infection and relieve pain. The medicine plan can be complicated, but it's important to take all the medicines as prescribed, even if your symptoms go away. If any H. pylori bacteria remain in your system, your condition can worsen. Gastritis caused by H. pylori can lead to a peptic ulcer and sometimes stomach cancer.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about H. pylori testing?After you've been treated with antibiotics, your health care provider may order repeat tests to make sure all the H. pylori bacteria is gone.
"
hematocrit test,"What is a hematocrit test?A hematocrit test is a type of blood test. Your blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These cells and platelets are suspended in a liquid called plasma. A hematocrit test measures how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. Red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Hematocrit levels that are too high or too low can indicate a blood disorder, dehydration, or other medical conditions.Other names: HCT, packed cell volume, PCV, Crit; Packed Cell Volume, PCV; H and H (Hemoglobin and Hematocrit)
","What is it used for?A hematocrit test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC), a routine test that measures different components of your blood. The test is also used to help diagnose blood disorders such as anemia, a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough red cells, or polycythemia vera, a rare disorder in which your blood has too many red cells.
","Why do I need a hematocrit test?Your health care provider may have ordered a hematocrit test as part of your regular checkup or if you have symptoms of a red blood cell disorder, such as anemia or polycythemia vera. These include:Symptoms of anemia:Shortness of breathWeakness or fatigueHeadacheDizzinessCold hands and feetPale skinChest painSymptoms of polycythemia vera:Blurred or double visionShortness of breathHeadacheItchingFlushed skinTirednessExcessive sweating
","What happens during a hematocrit test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a hematocrit test. If your health care provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.

"
hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) test,"What is a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test?
A hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test measures the amount of blood sugar (glucose) attached to hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. An HbA1c test shows what the average amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin has been over the past three months. It's a three-month average because that's typically how long a red blood cell lives.
If your HbA1c levels are high, it may be a sign of diabetes, a chronic condition that can cause serious health problems, including heart disease, kidney disease, and nerve damage.
Other names: HbA1c, A1c, glycohemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin

","What is it used for?
An HbA1c test may be used to check for diabetes or prediabetes in adults. Prediabetes means your blood sugar levels show you are at risk for getting diabetes.
If you already have diabetes, an HbA1c test can help monitor your condition and glucose levels.

","Why do I need an HbA1c test?
You may need an HbA1c test if you have symptoms of diabetes. These include:

Increased thirst
Increased urination
Blurred vision
Fatigue

Your health care provider may also order an HbA1c test if you are at higher risk for getting diabetes. Risk factors include:

Being overweight or obese
High blood pressure
History of heart disease
Physical inactivity


","What happens during an HbA1c test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for an HbA1c test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
HbA1c results are given in percentages. Typical results are below.

Normal: HbA1c below 5.7%
Prediabetes: HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%
Diabetes: HbA1c of 6.5% or higher

Your results may mean something different. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
If you have diabetes, the American Diabetes Association recommends keeping your HbA1c levels below 7%. Your health care provider may have other recommendations for you, depending on your overall health, age, weight, and other factors.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an HbA1c test?
The HbA1c test is not used for gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that only affects pregnant women, or for diagnosing diabetes in children.
Also, if you have anemia or another type of blood disorder, an HbA1c test may be less accurate for diagnosing diabetes. If you have one of these disorders and are at risk for diabetes, your health care provider may recommend different tests.
"
hemoglobin electrophoresis,"What is hemoglobin electrophoresis?
Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. There are several different types of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that measures the different types of hemoglobin in the blood. It also looks for abnormal types of hemoglobin.
Normal types of hemoglobin include:

Hemoglobin (Hgb) A, the most common type of hemoglobin in healthy adults
Hemoglobin (Hgb) F, fetal hemoglobin. This type of hemoglobin is found in unborn babies and newborns. HgbF is replaced by HgbA shortly after birth.

If levels of HgbA or HgbF are too high or too low, it can indicate certain types of anemia.
Abnormal types of hemoglobin include:

Hemoglobin (Hgb) S. This type of hemoglobin is found in sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder that causes the body to make stiff, sickle-shaped red blood cells. Healthy red blood cells are flexible so they can move easily through blood vessels. Sickle cells can get stuck in the blood vessels, causing severe and chronic pain, infections, and other complications.
Hemoglobin (Hgb) C. This type of hemoglobin does not carry oxygen well. It can cause a mild form of anemia.
Hemoglobin (Hgb) E. This type of hemoglobin is mostly found in people of Southeast Asian descent. People with HgbE usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms of anemia.

A hemoglobin electrophoresis test applies an electric current to a blood sample. This separates normal and abnormal types of hemoglobin. Each type of hemoglobin can then be measured individually.
Other names: Hb electrophoresis, hemoglobin evaluation, hemoglobinopathy evaluation, hemoglobin fractionation, Hb ELP, sickle cell screen
","What is it used for?
Hemoglobin electrophoresis measures hemoglobin levels and looks for abnormal types of hemoglobin. It's most often used to help diagnose anemia, sickle cell disease, and other hemoglobin disorders.
","Why do I need hemoglobin electrophoresis?
You may need testing if you have symptoms of a hemoglobin disorder. These include:

Fatigue
Pale skin
Jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow
Severe pain (sickle cell disease)
Growth problems (in children)

If you've just had a baby, your newborn will be tested as part of a newborn screening. Newborn screening is a group of tests given to most American babies shortly after birth. The screening checks for a variety of conditions. Many of these conditions can be treated if found early.
You may also want testing if you are at risk for having a child with sickle cell disease or another inherited hemoglobin disorder. Risk factors include:

Family history
Ethnic background

In the United States, most people with sickle cell disease are of African ancestry.
Thalassemia, another inherited hemoglobin disorder, is most common among people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African descent.



","What happens during hemoglobin electrophoresis?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
To test a newborn, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a hemoglobin electrophoresis test.
","Are there any risks to hemoglobin electrophoresis?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
Your results will show the types of hemoglobin found and the levels of each.
Hemoglobin levels that are too high or too low may mean:

Thalassemia, a condition that affects the production of hemoglobin. Symptoms range from mild to severe.
Sickle cell trait. In this condition, you have one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. Most people with sickle cell trait do not have health problems.
Sickle cell disease
Hemoglobin C disease, a condition that causes a mild form of anemia and sometimes an enlarged spleen and joint pain
Hemoglobin S-C disease, a condition that causes a mild or moderate form of sickle cell disease

Your results may also show whether a specific disorder is mild, moderate, or severe.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis test results are often compared with other tests, including a complete blood count and a blood smear. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about hemoglobin electrophoresis?
If you are at risk of having a child with an inherited hemoglobin disorder, you may want to speak to a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. He or she can help you understand the disorder and your risk of passing it along to your child.

hepatitis panel,"What is a hepatitis panel?Hepatitis is a type of liver disease. Viruses called hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are the most common causes of hepatitis. A hepatitis panel is a blood test that checks to see if you have a hepatitis infection caused by one of these viruses.The viruses are spread in different ways and cause different symptoms:Hepatitis A is most often spread by contact with contaminated feces (stool) or by eating tainted food. Though uncommon, it can also be spread through sexual contact with an infected person. Most people recover from hepatitis A without any lasting liver damage.Hepatitis B is spread through contact with infected blood, semen, or other bodily fluids. Some people recover quickly from a hepatitis B infection. For others, the virus can cause long-term, chronic liver disease.Hepatitis C is most often spread by contact with infected blood, usually through sharing of hypodermic needles. Though uncommon, it can also be spread through sexual contact with an infected person. Many people with hepatitis C develop chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.A hepatitis panel includes tests for hepatitis antibodies and antigens. Antibodies are proteins that the immune system produces to help fight infections. Antigens are substances that cause an immune response. Antibodies and antigens can be detected before symptoms appear.Other names: acute hepatitis panel, viral hepatitis panel, hepatitis screening panel
","What is it used for?A hepatitis panel is used to find out if you have a hepatitis virus infection.

her2 (breast cancer) testing,"What is HER2 breast cancer testing?HER2 stands for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. It is a gene that makes a protein found on the surface of all breast cells. It is involved in normal cell growth.Genes are the basic units of heredity, passed down from your mother and father. In certain cancers, especially breast cancer, the HER2 gene mutates (changes) and makes extra copies of the gene. When this happens, the HER2 gene makes too much HER2 protein, causing cells to divide and grow too fast.Cancers with high levels of the HER2 protein are known as HER2-positive. Cancers with low levels of the protein are known as HER2-negative. About 20 percent of breast cancers are HER2-positive.HER2 testing looks at a sample of tumor tissue. The most common ways to test tumor tissue are:Immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing measures the HER2 protein on the surface of the cellsFluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing looks for extra copies of the HER2 geneBoth types of tests can tell whether you have HER2-positive cancer. Treatments that specifically target HER2-positive breast cancer can be very effective.Other names: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, ERBB2 amplification, HER2 overexpression, HER2/neu tests
","What is it used for?HER2 testing is mostly used to find out whether cancer is HER2-positive. It is also sometimes used to see if cancer is responding to treatment or if cancer has returned after treatment.
","Why do I need HER2 breast cancer testing?If you've been diagnosed with breast cancer, you may need this test to find out if your cancer is HER2-positive or HER2-negative. If you are already being treated for HER2-positive breast cancer, you may need this test to:Find out if your treatment is working. Normal levels of HER2 may mean you are responding to treatment. High levels may mean the treatment is not working.Find out if cancer has come back after treatment.
","What happens during a HER2 breast cancer test?Most HER2 testing involves taking a sample of tumor tissue in a procedure called a biopsy. There are three main types of biopsy procedures:Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of breast cells or fluidCore needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sampleSurgical biopsy, which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedureFine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps:You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table.A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid.You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn.Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops.Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps.You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand.You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax.You will be given local or general anesthesia so you won't feel pain during the procedure.For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure.Once the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed.The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips.The type of biopsy you have will depend on different factors, including the size and location of the tumor. HER2 can also be measured in a blood test, but blood testing for HER2 has not been proven to be useful for most patients. So it is not usually recommended.After your tissue sample has been taken, it will be tested in one of two ways:HER2 protein levels will be measured.The sample will be looked at for extra copies of the HER2 gene.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site). If you are getting general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. Your surgeon will give you more specific instructions. Also, if you are getting a sedative or general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. Sometimes the site gets infected. If that happens, you will be treated with antibiotics. A surgical biopsy may cause some additional pain and discomfort. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe medicine to help you feel better.There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If HER2 protein levels are higher than normal or extra copies of the HER2 gene are found, it probably means you have HER2-positive cancer. If your results show normal amounts of HER2 protein or the normal number HER2 genes, you probably have HER2-negative cancer.If your results were not clearly positive or negative, you will probably get retested, either using a different tumor sample or using a different testing method. Most often, IHC (testing for the HER2 protein) is done first, followed by FISH (testing for extra copies of the gene). IHC testing is less expensive and provides faster results than FISH. But most breast specialists think FISH testing is more accurate.Treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer can substantially shrink cancerous tumors, with very few side effects. These treatments are not effective in HER2-negative cancers.If you are being treated for HER2-positive cancer, normal results may mean you are responding to treatment. Results that show higher than normal amounts may mean your treatment is not working, or that cancer has come back after treatment.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about HER2 breast cancer testing?While it's much more common in women, breast cancer, including HER2-positive breast cancer, can also affect men. If a man has been diagnosed with breast cancer, HER2 testing may be recommended.In addition, both men and women may need HER2 testing if they have been diagnosed with certain cancers of the stomach and esophagus. These cancers sometimes have high levels of the HER2 protein and may respond well to HER2-positive cancer treatments.

herpes (hsv) test,"What is a herpes (HSV) test?Herpes is a skin infection caused by the herpes simplex virus, known as HSV. HSV causes painful blisters or sores in different parts of the body. There are two main types of HSV:HSV-1, which usually causes blisters or cold sores around the mouth (oral herpes)HSV-2, which usually causes blisters or sores in the genital area (genital herpes)Herpes is spread through direct contact with sores. HSV-2 is usually spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Sometimes herpes can be spread even if there are no visible sores.Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are recurring infections. That means after your first outbreak of sores clears up, you may get another outbreak in the future. But the severity and number of outbreaks tend to lessen over time. Although oral and genital herpes can be uncomfortable, the viruses usually don't cause any major health problems.In rare cases, HSV can infect other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord. These infections can be very serious. Herpes can also be dangerous to a newborn baby. A mother with herpes can pass the infection to her baby during delivery. A herpes infection can be life threatening to a baby.An HSV test looks for the presence of the virus in your body. While there is no cure for herpes, there are medicines that can help manage the condition.Other names: herpes culture, herpes simplex viral culture, HSV-1 antibodies, HSV-2 antibodies, HSV DNA
","What is it used for?An HSV test may be used to:Find out whether sores on the mouth or genitals are caused by HSVDiagnose an HSV infection in a pregnant womanFind out if a newborn is infected with HSV
","Why do I need an HSV test?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend HSV testing for people without symptoms of HSV. But you may need an HSV test if:You have symptoms of herpes, such as blisters or sores on the genitals or other part of the bodyYour sex partner has herpesYou are pregnant and you or your partner has had a previous herpes infection or symptoms of genital herpes. If you test positive for HSV, your baby may need testing as well.HSV-2 may increase your risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). You may need a test if you have certain risk factors for STDs. You may be at higher risk if you:Have multiple sex partnersAre a man who has sex with menHave a partner with HIV and/or another STDIn rare cases, HSV can cause encephalitis or meningitis, life-threatening infections of the brain and spinal cord. You may need an HSV test if you have symptoms of a brain or spinal cord disorder. These include:FeverStiff neckConfusionSevere headacheSensitivity to light
","What happens during an HSV test?HSV testing is usually done as a swab test, blood test, or lumbar puncture. The type of test you get will depend on your symptoms and health history.For a swab test, a health care provider will use a swab to collect fluid and cells from a herpes sore.For a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.A lumbar puncture, also called a spinal tap, is only done if your provider thinks you may have an infection of the brain or spinal cord. During a spinal tap:You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a swab test or a blood test. For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is no known risk to having a swab test.There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure.
","What do the results mean?Your HSV test results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal.Negative/Normal. The herpes virus was not found. You may still have an HSV infection if your results were normal. It may mean the sample didn't have enough of the virus to be detected. If you still have symptoms of herpes, you may need to get tested again.Positive/Abnormal. HSV was found in your sample. It may mean you have an active infection (you currently have sores), or were infected in the past (you have no sores).If you tested positive for HSV, talk to your health care provider. While there is no cure for herpes, it hardly ever causes serious health problems. Some people may only have one outbreak of sores their whole lives, while others break out more often. If you want to reduce the severity and number of your outbreaks, your provider may prescribe a medicine that can help.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an HSV test?The best way to prevent genital herpes or another STD is to not have sex. If you are sexually active, you can reduce your risk of infection byBeing in a long-term relationship with one partner who has tested negative for STDsUsing condoms correctly every time you have sexIf you've been diagnosed with genital herpes, condom use can reduce your risk of spreading the infection to others.

hiv screening test,"What is an HIV test?
An HIV test shows whether you are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). HIV is a virus that attacks and destroys cells in the immune system. These cells protect your body against disease-causing germs, such as bacteria and viruses. If you lose too many immune cells, your body will have trouble fighting off infections and other diseases.
There are three main types of HIV tests:

Antibody Test. This test looks for HIV antibodies in your blood or saliva. Your immune system makes antibodies when you are exposed to bacteria or viruses, like HIV. An HIV antibody test can determine if you have HIV from 3–12 weeks after infection. That's because it can take a few weeks or longer for your immune system to make antibodies to HIV. You may be able to do an HIV antibody test in the privacy of your home. Ask your health care provider about at-home HIV test kits.
HIV Antibody/Antigen Test. This test looks for HIV antibodies and antigens in the blood. An antigen is a part of a virus that triggers an immune response. If you've been exposed to HIV, antigens will show up in your blood before HIV antibodies are made. This test can usually find HIV within 2–6 weeks of infection. The HIV antibody/antigen test is one of the most common types of HIV tests.
HIV Viral Load. This test measures the amount of the HIV virus in the blood. It can find HIV faster than antibody and antibody/antigen tests, but it is very expensive. It is mostly used for monitoring HIV infections.

Other names: HIV antibody/antigen tests, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody and antigen evaluation, HIV test, human immunodeficiency virus antibody test, type 1, HIV p24 antigen test
","What is it used for?An HIV test is used to find out if you have been infected with HIV. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most people with HIV don't have AIDS. People with AIDS have an extremely low number of immune cells and are at risk for life-threatening illnesses, including dangerous infections, a severe type of pneumonia, and certain cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma.If HIV is found early, you can get medicines to protect your immune system. HIV medicines may prevent you from getting AIDS.
","Why do I need an HIV test?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. You may also need an HIV test if you are at higher risk for infection. HIV is mainly spread through sexual contact and blood, so you may be at a higher risk for HIV if you:Are a man that has had sex with another manHave had sex with an HIV-infected partnerHave had multiple sex partnersHave injected drugs, such as heroin, or shared drug needles with someone elseHIV can spread from mother to child during birth and through breast milk, so if you are pregnant your doctor may order an HIV test. There are medicines you can take during pregnancy and delivery to greatly reduce your risk of spreading the disease to your baby.
","What happens during an HIV test?You will either get a blood test in a lab, or do your own test at home.For a blood test in a lab:A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For at home test, you will need to get a sample of saliva from your mouth or a drop of blood from your fingertip.The test kit will provide instructions on how to get your sample, package it, and send it to a lab.For a saliva test, you will use special spatula-like tool to take a swab from your mouth.For a fingertip antibody blood test, you will use a special tool to prick your finger and collect a sample of blood.For more information on at-home testing, talk to your health care provider.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an HIV test. But you should talk with a counselor before and/or after your test so you can better understand what the results mean and your treatment options if you are diagnosed with HIV.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having any HIV screening test. If you get a blood test from a lab, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your result is negative, it can mean you don't have HIV. A negative result may also mean you have HIV but it's too soon to tell. It can take a few weeks for HIV antibodies and antigens to show up in your body. If your result is negative, your health care provider may order additional HIV tests at a later date.If your result is positive, you will get a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis. If both tests are positive, it means you have HIV. It does not mean you have AIDS. While there is no cure for HIV, there are better treatments available now than in the past. Today, people with HIV are living longer, with a better quality of life than ever before. If you are living with HIV, it's important to see your health care provider regularly.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

","What is it used for?An HIV viral load test may be used to:Check how well your HIV medicines are workingMonitor any changes in your HIV infectionDiagnose HIV if you think you've been recently infectedAn HIV viral load is an expensive test and is mostly used when a quick result is needed. Other less expensive types of tests are used more often for diagnosing HIV.
","Why do I need an HIV viral load?Your health care provider may order an HIV viral load when you are first diagnosed with HIV. This initial measurement helps your provider measure how your condition changes over time. You will probably be tested again every three to four months to see if your viral levels have changed since your first test. If you are being treated for HIV, your health care provider may order regular viral load tests to see how well your medicines are working.You may also need an HIV viral load if you think you may have been recently infected. HIV is mainly spread through sexual contact and blood. (It can also be transmitted from mother to child during birth and through breast milk.) You may be at higher risk of infection if you:Are a man that has had sex with another manHave had sex with an HIV-infected partnerHave had multiple sex partnersHave injected drugs, such as heroin, or shared drug needles with someone elseAn HIV viral load can find HIV in your blood within days after you've been infected. Other tests can take several weeks or months to show an infection. During that time, you could infect someone else without knowing it. An HIV viral load gives you results sooner, so you can avoid spreading the disease.
","What happens during an HIV viral load?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle.

","What do the results mean?Below is a list of typical results. Your results may vary depending on your health and even the lab used for testing.A normal result means no HIV was found in your blood, and you are not infected.A low viral load means the virus is not very active and probably means your HIV treatment is working.A high viral load means the virus is more active and your treatment is not working well. The higher the viral load, the more risk you have for problems and diseases related to a weak immune system. It may also mean you are at higher risk for developing AIDS. If your results show a high viral load, your health care provider will probably make changes in your treatment plan.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

homocysteine test,"What is a homocysteine test?
A homocysteine test measures the amount of homocysteine in your blood. Homocysteine is a type of amino acid, a chemical your body uses to make proteins. Normally, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid break down homocysteine and change it into other substances your body needs. There should be very little homocysteine left in the bloodstream. If you have high levels of homocysteine in your blood, it may be a sign of a vitamin deficiency, heart disease, or a rare inherited disorder.
Other names: total homocysteine, plasma total homocysteine

","What is it used for?
A homocysteine test may be used to:

Find out if you have deficiency in vitamin B12, B6, or folic acid.
Help diagnose homocystinuria, a rare, inherited disorder that prevents the body from breaking down certain proteins. It can cause serious health problems and usually starts in early childhood. Most U.S. states require all infants to get a homocysteine blood test as part of routine newborn screening.
Screen for heart disease in people at high risk for heart attack or stroke
Monitor people who have heart disease.


","Why do I need a homocysteine test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a vitamin B or folic acid deficiency. These include:  

Dizziness
Weakness
Fatigue
Pale skin
Sore tongue and mouth
Tingling in the hands, feet, arms, and/or legs (in vitamin B12 deficiency)

You may also need this test if you are at high risk for heart disease because of prior heart problems or a family history of heart disease. Excess levels of homocysteine can build up in the arteries, which may increase your risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke.

","What happens during a homocysteine test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 8–12 hours before a homocysteine test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
If your results show high homocysteine levels, it may mean:

You are not getting enough vitamin B12, B6, or folic acid in your diet.
You are at a higher risk of heart disease.
Homocystinuria. If high levels of homocysteine are found, more testing will be needed to rule out or confirm a diagnosis.

If your homocysteine levels were not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Other factors can affect your results, including:

Your age. Homocysteine levels can get higher as you get older.
Your gender. Men usually have higher homocysteine levels than women.
Alcohol use
Smoking
Use of vitamin B supplements

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider. 
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

how to understand your lab results,,"Why do I need a lab test?Lab tests are used in many different ways. Your health care provider may order one or more lab tests to:Diagnose or rule out a specific disease or conditionAn HPV test is an example of this type of test. It can show you whether or not you have an HPV infectionScreen for a disease. A screening test can show if you are at a higher risk for getting a specific disease. It can also find out if you have a disease, even if you have no symptoms.A Pap test is a type of screening test for cervical cancerMonitor a disease and/or treatment. If you've already been diagnosed with a disease, lab tests can show if your condition is getting better or worse. It can also show if your treatment is working.A blood glucose test is a type of test that is used to monitor diabetes and diabetes treatment. It is also sometimes used to diagnose the disease.Check your overall health. Lab tests are often included in a routine checkup. Your provider may order tests of various organs and systems to see if there have been changes in your health over time. Testing can help find health problems before symptoms appear.A complete blood count is a type of routine test that measures different substances in your blood. It can give your health care provider important information about your overall health and risk for certain diseases.
","What do my results mean?Lab results are often shown as a set of numbers known as a reference range. A reference range may also be called ""normal values."" You may see something like this on your results: ""normal: 77-99mg/dL"" (milligrams per deciliter). Reference ranges are based on the normal test results of a large group of healthy people. The range helps show what a typical normal result looks like.But not everyone is typical. Sometimes, healthy people get results outside the reference range, while people with health problems can have results in the normal range. If your results fall outside the reference range, or if you have symptoms despite a normal result, you will likely need more testing.Your lab results may also include one of these terms:Negative or normal, which means the disease or substance being tested was not foundPositive or abnormal, which means the disease or substance was foundInconclusive or uncertain, which means there wasn't enough information in the results to diagnose or rule out a disease. If you get an inconclusive result, you will probably get more tests.Tests that measure various organs and systems often give results as reference ranges, while tests that diagnose or rule out diseases often use the terms listed above.

human papillomavirus (hpv) test,"What is an HPV test?
HPV stands for human papillomavirus. It is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD), with millions of Americans currently infected. HPV can infect both men and women. Most people with HPV don't know they have it and never get any symptoms or health problems.
There are many different types of HPV. Some types do cause health problems. HPV infections are usually grouped as low-risk or high-risk HPV.

Low-Risk HPV can cause warts on the anus and genital area, and sometimes the mouth. Other low-risk HPV infections can cause warts on arms, hands, feet, or chest. HPV warts do not cause serious health problems. They may go away on their own, or a health care provider may remove them in a minor in-office procedure.
High-Risk HPV. Most high-risk HPV infections do not cause any symptoms and will go away within a year or two. But some high-risk HPV infections can last for years. These long-lasting infections can lead to cancer. HPV is the cause of most cervical cancers. Long-lasting HPV may also cause other cancers, including those of the anus, vagina, penis, mouth, and throat.

An HPV test looks for high-risk HPV in women. Health care providers can usually diagnose low-risk HPV by visually examining the warts. So no testing is needed. While men can be infected with HPV, there is no test available for men. Most men with HPV recover from the infection without any symptoms.
Other names: genital human papillomavirus, high risk HPV, HPV DNA, HPV RNA

","What is it used for?
The test is used to check for the type of HPV that can lead to cervical cancer. It is often done at the same time as a pap smear, a procedure that checks for abnormal cells that can also lead to cervical cancer. When an HPV test and a pap smear are done at the same time, it's called co-testing.

","Why do I need an HPV test?
You may need an HPV test if you:

Are a woman aged 30-65. The American Cancer Society recommends women in this age group have an HPV test with a pap smear (co-testing) every five years.
If you are a woman of any age that gets an abnormal result on a pap smear

HPV testing in not recommended for women younger than 30 who have had normal pap smear results. Cervical cancer is rare in this age group, but HPV infections are common. Most HPV infections in young women clear up without treatment.

","What happens during an HPV test?
For an HPV test, you will lie on your back on an exam table, with your knees bent. You will rest your feet in supports called stirrups. Your health care provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or plastic spatula to collect cells from the cervix. If you are also getting a pap smear, your provider may use the same sample for both tests, or collect a second sample of cells.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You should not have the test while you are having your period. You should also avoid certain activities before testing. Starting two days before your test, you should not:

Use tampons
Use vaginal medicines or birth control foams
Douche
Have sex


","Are there any risks to the test?
There are no known risks to an HPV test. You may feel some mild discomfort during the procedure. Afterward, you may have a little bleeding or other vaginal discharge.

","What do the results mean?
Your results will be given as negative, also called normal, or positive, also called abnormal.
Negative/Normal. No high-risk HPV was found. Your health care provider may recommend you come back for another screening in five years, or sooner depending on your age and medical history.
Positive/Abnormal. High-risk HPV was found. It does not mean you have cancer. It means you may be at higher risk for getting cervical cancer in the future. Your health care provider may order more tests to monitor and/or diagnose your condition. These tests may include:

Colposcopy, a procedure in which your provider uses a special magnifying tool (colposcope) to look at the vagina and cervix
Cervical Biopsy, a procedure in which your provider takes a sample of tissue from the cervix to look at under a microscope
More frequent co-testing (HPV and pap smear)

If your results were positive, it's important to get regular or more frequent tests. It can take decades for abnormal cervical cells to turn into cancer. If found early, abnormal cells can be treated before they become cancerous. It's much easier to prevent cervical cancer than to treat it once it develops.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an HPV test?
There is no treatment for HPV, but most infections clear up on their own. You can take steps to reduce your risk of getting HPV. Having sex with only one partner and having safe sex (using a condom) can lower your risk. Vaccination is even more effective.
The HPV vaccine is a safe, effective way to protect yourself from the HPV infections that commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine works best when it's given to someone who has never been exposed to the virus. So it's recommended to give it to people before they start sexual activity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend girls and boys get vaccinated starting at age 11 or 12. Usually, a total of two or three HPV shots (vaccinations) are given, spaced a few months apart. The difference in  the number of doses depends on the age of your child or young adult and the recommendations of the health care provider.
If you have questions about the HPV vaccine, talk to your child's health care provider and/or your own provider.

hysteroscopy,"What is a hysteroscopy?
A hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows a health care provider to look at the inside of a woman's cervix and uterus. It uses a thin tube called a hysteroscope, which is inserted through the vagina. The tube has a camera on it. The camera sends images of the uterus onto a video screen. The procedure can help diagnose and treat causes of abnormal bleeding, uterine diseases, and other conditions.
Other names: hysteroscopic surgery, diagnostic hysteroscopy, operative hysteroscopy
","What is it used for?
A hysteroscopy is most often used to:

Diagnose the cause of abnormal bleeding
Help find the cause of infertility, the inability to get pregnant after at least a year of trying
Find the cause of repeated miscarriages (more than two miscarriages in a row)
Find and remove fibroids and polyps. These are types of abnormal growths in the uterus. They are usually not cancerous.
Remove scar tissue from the uterus
Remove an intrauterine device (IUD), a small, plastic device placed inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy
Perform a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing.
Implant a permanent birth control device into the fallopian tubes. Fallopian tubes carry eggs from the ovaries into the uterus during ovulation (the release of an egg during the menstrual cycle).

","Why do I need a hysteroscopy?
You may need this test if:

You are having heavier than normal menstrual periods and/or bleeding between periods.
You are bleeding after menopause.
You are having trouble getting or staying pregnant.
You want a permanent form of birth control.
You want to remove an IUD.

","What happens during a hysteroscopy?
A hysteroscopy is often done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center. The procedure usually includes the following steps:

You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.
You will lie on your back on an exam table with your feet in stirrups.
An intravenous (IV) line may be put in your arm or hand.
You may be given a sedative, a type of medicine to help you relax and block the pain. Some women may be given general anesthesia. General anesthesia is a medicine that will make you unconscious during the procedure. A specially trained doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you this medicine.
Your vaginal area will be cleaned with a special soap.
Your provider will insert a tool called a speculum into your vagina. It is used to spread open your vaginal walls.
Your provider will then insert the hysteroscope into the vagina and move it through your cervix and into your uterus.
Your provider will inject a liquid or gas through the hysteroscope and into your uterus. This helps expand the uterus so your provider can get a better view.
Your provider will be able to see images of the uterus on a video screen.
Your provider may take a sample of tissue for testing (biopsy).
If you are having a uterine growth removed or another uterine treatment, your provider will insert tools through the hysteroscope to perform the treatment.

A hysteroscopy may take 15 minutes to an hour, depending on what was done during the procedure. The medicines you were given may make you drowsy for a while. You should arrange for someone to drive you home after the procedure.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
If you will be getting general anesthesia, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for 6–12 hours before the procedure. Do not use a douche, tampons, or vaginal medicines for 24 hours before the test.
It's best to schedule your hysteroscopy when you are not having your menstrual period. If you get your period unexpectedly, tell your health care provider. You may need to reschedule.
Also, tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you might be. A hysteroscopy should not be done on pregnant women. The procedure may be harmful to an unborn baby.
","Are there any risks to the test?
A hysteroscopy is a very safe procedure. You may have mild cramping and a little bloody discharge for a few days after the procedure. Serious complications are rare, but they may include heavy bleeding, infection, and tears in the uterus.
","What do the results mean?
If your results were not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions:

Fibroids, polyps, or other abnormal growths were found. Your provider may be able to remove these growths during the procedure. He or she may also take a sample of the growths for further testing.
Scar tissue was found in the uterus. This tissue may be removed during the procedure.
The size or shape of the uterus did not look normal.
Openings on one or both fallopian tubes are closed.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a hysteroscopy?
A hysteroscopy is not recommended for women with cervical cancer or pelvic inflammatory disease.

immunofixation (ife) blood test,"What is an immunofixation (IFE) blood test?
An immunofixation blood test, also known as protein electrophoresis, measures certain proteins in the blood. Proteins play many important roles, including providing energy for the body, rebuilding muscles, and supporting the immune system.
There are two main types of proteins in the blood: albumin and globulin. The test separates these proteins into subgroups based on their size and electrical charge. The subgroups are:

Albumin
Alpha-1 globulin
Alpha-2 globulin
Beta globulin
Gamma globulin

Measuring the proteins in each subgroup can help diagnose a variety of diseases.
Other names: serum protein electrophoresis, (SPEP), protein electrophoresis, SPE,  immunofixation electrophoresis, IFE, serum immunofixation

insulin in blood,"What is an insulin in blood test?
This test measures the amount of insulin in your blood. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar, known as glucose, from your bloodstream into your cells. Glucose comes from the foods you eat and drink. It is your body's main source of energy.
Insulin plays a key role in keeping glucose at the right levels. If glucose levels are too high or too low, it can cause serious health problems. Glucose levels that are not normal are known as:

Hyperglycemia, blood glucose levels that are too high. It happens when your body doesn't make enough insulin. If there's not enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells. It stays in the bloodstream instead.
Hypoglycemia, blood glucose levels that are too low. If your body sends too much insulin into the blood, too much glucose will go into your cells. This leaves less in the bloodstream.

Diabetes is the most common cause of abnormal glucose levels. There are two types of diabetes.

Type 1 Diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin at all. This can cause hyperglycemia.
Type 2 Diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but the cells in your body don't respond well to insulin and can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. This is called insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance often develops before type 2 diabetes. At first, insulin resistance causes the body to make extra insulin, to make up for ineffective insulin. Extra insulin in the bloodstream can cause hypoglycemia. But insulin resistance tends to get worse over time. Eventually, it decreases your body's ability to make insulin. As insulin levels drop, blood sugar levels rise. If levels don't return to normal, you may get type 2 diabetes.
Other names: fasting insulin, insulin serum, total and free insulin
","What is it used for?An insulin in blood test is most often used to:Find out the cause of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)Diagnose or monitor insulin resistanceMonitor the condition of people with type 2 diabetesFind out if there is a type of tumor on the pancreas, known as an insulinoma. If the tumor has been removed, the test may be used to see if it has been done successfully.An insulin in blood test is sometimes used along with other tests to help diagnose and monitor type 1 diabetes. These other tests may include glucose and hemoglobin AIC testing.
","Why do I need an insulin in blood test?You may need an insulin in blood test if you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). These include:SweatingTremblingIrregular heartbeatConfusionDizzinessBlurred visionExtreme hungerYou may also need this test if other tests, such as a blood glucose test, show you have low blood sugar.
","What happens during an insulin in blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for eight hours before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

"
intravenous pyelogram (ivp),"What is an intravenous pyelogram (IVP)?An intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a type of x-ray that provides images of the urinary tract. The urinary tract is made up of:Kidneys, two organs located below the rib cage. They filter the blood, remove wastes, and make urine.Bladder, a hollow organ in the pelvis area that stores your urine.Ureters, thin tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder.In men, an IVP will also take images of the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. The prostate lies below a man's bladder.During an IVP, a health care provider will inject one of your veins with a substance called contrast dye. The dye travels through your bloodstream and into your urinary tract. Contrast dye makes your kidneys, bladder, and ureters look bright white on the x-rays. This allows your provider to get clear, detailed images of these organs. It can help show whether there are any disorders or problems with the structure or function of the urinary tract.Other names: excretory urography
","What is it used for?An IVP is used to help diagnose disorders of the urinary tract. These include:Kidney stonesKidney cystsEnlarged prostateTumors in the kidneys, bladder, or uretersBirth defects that affect the structure of the urinary tractScarring from a urinary tract infection
","Why do I need an IVP?You may need an IVP if you have symptoms of a urinary tract disorder. These include:Pain in your side or backAbdominal painBlood in your urineCloudy urinePain when urinatingNausea and vomitingSwelling in your feet or legsFever
","What happens during an IVP?An IVP may be done in a hospital or a health care provider's office. The procedure usually includes the following steps:You will lie face up on an x-ray table.A health care provider called a radiology technician will inject contrast dye into your arm.You may have a special belt tightly wrapped around your abdomen. This can help the contrast dye stay in the urinary tract.The technician will walk behind a wall or into another room to turn on the x-ray machine.Several x-rays will be taken. You will need to stay very still while the images are being taken.You will be asked to urinate. You will be given a bedpan or urinal, or you may be able to get up and use the bathroom.After you've urinated, a final image will be taken to see how much contrast dye is left in the bladder.When the test is over, you should drink plenty of fluids to help flush the contrast dye out of your body.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) after midnight on the night before your test. You may also be asked to take a mild laxative on the evening before the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?Some people may have an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Reactions are usually mild and may include itching and/or a rash. Serious complications are rare. Be sure to tell your health care provider if you have other allergies. This may put you at higher risk for an allergic reaction to the dye.Some people may feel a mild itching sensation and a metallic taste in the mouth as the contrast dye travels through the body. These feelings are harmless and usually go away within a minute or two.You should tell your health care provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. An IVP delivers a low dose of radiation. The dose is safe for most people, but it can be harmful to an unborn baby.
","What do the results mean?Your results will be looked at by a radiologist, a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating medical conditions using imaging technologies. He or she will share the results with your health care provider.If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following disorders:Kidney stoneKidneys, bladder, or ureters that have an abnormal shape, size, or position in the bodyDamage or scarring of the urinary tractTumor or cyst in the urinary tractEnlarged prostate (in men)If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an IVP?IVP tests aren't used as often as CT (computerized tomography) scans for viewing the urinary tract. A CT scan is a type of x-ray that takes a series of pictures as it rotates around you. CT scans can provide more detailed information than an IVP. But IVP tests can be very helpful in finding kidney stones and certain urinary tract disorders. Also, an IVP test exposes you to less radiation than a CT scan.

iron tests,"What are iron tests?
Iron tests measure different substances in the blood to check iron levels in your body. Iron is a mineral that's essential for making red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Iron levels that are too low or too high can cause serious health problems.
Different types of iron tests include:

Serum iron test, which measures the amount of iron in the blood
Transferrin test, which measures transferrin, a protein that moves iron throughout the body
Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), which measures how well iron attaches to transferrin and other proteins in the blood
Ferritin blood test, which measures how much iron is stored in the body

Some or all of these tests are often ordered at the same time.
Other names: Fe tests, iron indices
","What are they used for?
Iron tests are most often used to:

Check if your iron levels are too low, a sign of anemia
Diagnose different types of anemia
Check if your iron levels are too high, which could be a sign of hemochromatosis. This is a rare genetic disorder that causes too much iron to build up in the body.
See if treatments for iron deficiency (low iron levels) or excess iron (high iron levels) are working

","Why do I need an iron test?
You may need testing if you have symptoms of iron levels that are too low or too high.
Symptoms of iron levels that are too low include:

karyotype genetic test,"What is a karyotype test?A karyotype test looks at the size, shape, and number of your chromosomes. Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color.People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell. One of each pair of chromosomes comes from your mother, and the other pair comes from your father.If you have more or fewer chromosomes than 46, or if there is anything unusual about the size or shape of your chromosomes, it can mean you have a genetic disease. A karyotype test is often used to help find genetic defects in a developing baby.Other names: genetic testing, chromosome testing, chromosome studies, cytogenetic analysis
","What is it used for?A karyotype test may be used to:Check an unborn baby for genetic disordersDiagnose a genetic disease in a baby or young childFind out if a chromosomal defect is preventing a woman from getting pregnant or is causing miscarriagesCheck a stillborn baby (a baby that died late in pregnancy or during birth) to see if a chromosomal defect was the cause of deathSee if you have a genetic disorder that could be passed along to your childrenDiagnose or make a treatment plan for certain types of cancer and blood disorders
","Why do I need a karyotype test?If you are pregnant, you may want to get a karyotype test for your unborn baby if you have certain risk factors. These include:Your age. The overall risk of genetic birth defects is small, but the risk is higher for women who have babies at age 35 or older.Family history. Your risk is increased if you, your partner, and/or another one of your children has a genetic disorder.Your baby or young child may need a test if he or she has signs of a genetic disorder. There are many types of genetic disorders, each with different symptoms. You and your health care provider can talk about whether testing is recommended.If you are a woman, you may need a karyotype test if you've had trouble getting pregnant or have had several miscarriages. While one miscarriage is not uncommon, if you have had several, it may be due to a chromosomal problem.You may also need a karyotype test if you have symptoms of or have been diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma, or a certain type of anemia. These disorders can cause chromosomal changes. Finding these changes can help your provider diagnose, monitor, and/or treat the disease.

For this test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.Prenatal testing with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are tiny growths found in the placenta.For amniocentesis:You'll lie on your back on an exam table.Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen. Ultrasound uses sound waves to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby.Your provider will insert a thin needle into your abdomen and withdraw a small amount of amniotic fluid.Amniocentesis is usually done between week 15 and 20 of pregnancy.For CVS:You'll lie on your back on an exam table.Your provider will move an ultrasound device over your abdomen to check the position of your uterus, placenta, and baby.Your provider will collect cells from the placenta in one of two ways: either through your cervix with a thin tube called a catheter, or with a thin needle through your abdomen.CVS is usually done between week 10 and 13 of pregnancy.Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy. If you are being tested for or treated for a certain type of cancer or blood disorder, your provider may need to take a sample of your bone marrow. For this test:You'll lie on your side or your stomach, depending on which bone will be used for testing. Most bone marrow tests are taken from the hip bone.The site will be cleaned with an antiseptic.You will get an injection of a numbing solution.Once the area is numb, the health care provider will take the sample.For a bone marrow aspiration, which is usually performed first, the health care provider will insert a needle through the bone and pull out bone marrow fluid and cells. You may feel a sharp but brief pain when the needle is inserted.For a bone marrow biopsy, the health care provider will use a special tool that twists into the bone to take out a sample of bone marrow tissue. You may feel some pressure on the site while the sample is being taken.

kidney stone analysis,"What is a kidney stone analysis?
Kidney stones are small, pebble-like substances made from chemicals in your urine. They are formed in the kidneys when high levels of certain substances, such as minerals or salts, get into the urine. A kidney stone analysis is a test that figures out what a kidney stone is made of. There are four main types of kidney stones:

Calcium, the most common type of kidney stone
Uric acid, another common type of kidney stone
Struvite, a less common stone that is caused by urinary tract infections
Cystine, a rare type of stone that tends to run in families

Kidney stones can be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball. Many stones pass through your body when you urinate. Larger or odd-shaped stones can get stuck inside the urinary tract and may need treatment. While kidney stones rarely cause serious damage, they can be very painful.
If you've had a kidney stone in the past, you are likely to get another one. A kidney stone analysis provides information on what a stone is made of. This can help your health care provider develop a treatment plan to reduce your risk of forming more stones.

lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) test,"What is a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) test?This test measures the level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), also known as lactic acid dehydrogenase, in your blood or sometimes in other body fluids. LDH is a type of protein, known as an enzyme. LDH plays an important role in making your body's energy. It is found in almost all the body's tissues, including those in the blood, heart, kidneys, brain, and lungs.When these tissues are damaged, they release LDH into the bloodstream or other body fluids. If your LDH blood or fluid levels are high, it may mean certain tissues in your body have been damaged by disease or injury.Other names: LD test, lactic dehydrogenase, lactic acid dehydrogenase
","What is it used for?An LDH test is most often used to:Find out if you have tissue damageMonitor disorders that cause tissue damage. These include anemia, liver disease, lung disease, and some types of infections.Monitor chemotherapy for certain types cancer. The test may show if treatment is working.
","Why do I need an LDH test?You may need this test if other tests and/or your symptoms indicate you have tissue damage or disease. Symptoms will vary depending on the type of tissue damage you have.You may also need an LDH test if you are currently being treated for cancer.
","What happens during an LDH test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.LDH is sometimes measured in other body fluids, including fluids in the spinal cord, lungs, or abdomen. If you are having one of these tests, your health care provider will give more information about the procedure.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an LDH blood test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Higher than normal LDH levels usually means you have some type of tissue damage or disease. Disorders that cause high LDH levels include:AnemiaKidney diseaseLiver diseaseMuscle injuryHeart attackPancreatitisInfections, including meningitis, encephalitis, and infectious mononucleosis (mono)Certain types of cancer, including lymphoma and leukemia. A higher than normal LDH level may also mean treatment for cancer is not working.Although the test can show if you have tissue damage or disease, it does not show where the damage is located. If your results showed higher than normal LDH levels, your provider may need to order more tests to make a diagnosis. One of these tests may be an LDH isoenzyme test. An LDH isoenzyme test measures different forms of LDH.

lactic acid test,"What is a lactic acid test?This test measures the level of lactic acid, also known as lactate, in your blood. Lactic acid is a substance made by muscle tissue and by red blood cells, which carry oxygen from your lungs to other parts of your body. Normally, the level of lactic acid in the blood is low. Lactic acid levels rise when oxygen levels decrease. Low oxygen levels may be caused by:Strenuous exerciseHeart failureSevere infectionShock, a dangerous condition that limits blood flow to your organs and tissuesIf lactic acid levels get too high, it can lead to a life-threatening condition known as lactic acidosis. A lactic acid test can help diagnose lactic acidosis before it causes serious complications.Other names: lactate test, lactic acid: plasma
","What is it used for?A lactic acid test is most often used to diagnose lactic acidosis. The test may also be used to:Help find out if enough oxygen is reaching the body's tissuesHelp diagnose sepsis, a life-threatening reaction to a bacterial infectionIf meningitis is suspected, the test may also be used to help find out if it is caused by bacteria or a virus. Meningitis is a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord. A test for lactate in cerebrospinal fluid is used with a lactic acid blood test to figure out the type of infection.
","Why do I need a lactic acid test?You may need a lactic acid test if you have symptoms of lactic acidosis. These include:Nausea and vomitingMuscle weaknessSweatingShortness of breathAbdominal painYou may also need this test if you have symptoms of sepsis or meningitis. Symptoms of sepsis include:FeverChillsRapid heart rateRapid breathingConfusionSymptoms of meningitis include:Severe headacheFeverStiff neckSensitivity to light
","What happens during a lactic acid test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein or an artery. To take a sample from a vein, the health care professional will insert a small needle into your arm. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Make sure you don't clench your fist during the test, as this can temporarily raise lactic acid levels.Blood from an artery has more oxygen than blood from a vein, so your health care provider may recommend this type of blood test. The sample is usually taken from an artery inside the wrist. During the procedure, your provider will insert a needle with a syringe into the artery. You may feel a sharp pain as the needle goes into the artery. Once the syringe is filled with blood, your provider will put a bandage over the puncture site. After the procedure, you or a provider will need to apply firm pressure to the site for 5–10 minutes, or even longer if you are taking a blood-thinning medicine.If meningitis is suspected, your provider may order a test called a spinal tap or lumbar puncture to get a sample of your cerebrospinal fluid.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?Your health care provider may tell you to not exercise for several hours before the test. Exercise can cause a temporary increase in lactic acid levels.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.A blood test from an artery is more painful than a blood test from a vein, but this pain usually goes away quickly. You may have some bleeding, bruising, or soreness at the spot where the needle was put in. Though problems are rare, you should avoid lifting heavy objects for 24 hours after the test.
","What do the results mean?A high lactic acid level means you likely have lactic acidosis. There are two types of lactic acidosis: type A and type B. The cause of your lactic acidosis depends on which type you have.Type A is the most common form of the disorder. Conditions that cause type A lactic acidosis include:SepsisShockHeart failureLung diseaseAnemiaType B lactic acidosis may be caused by one of the following conditions:Liver diseaseLeukemiaKidney diseaseStrenuous exerciseIf you had a spinal tap to check for a meningitis infection, your results may show:High levels of lactic acid. This probably means you have bacterial meningitis.Normal or slightly high levels of lactic acid. This probably means you have a viral form of the infection.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a lactic test?Certain medicines cause the body to make too much lactic acid. These include some treatments for HIV and a medicine for type 2 diabetes called metformin. If you are taking any of these medicines, you may be at a higher risk for lactic acidosis. Talk to your health care provider if you are concerned about any medicines you are taking.
"
laparoscopy,"What is a laparoscopy?A laparoscopy is a type of surgery that checks for problems in the abdomen or a woman's reproductive system. Laparoscopic surgery uses a thin tube called a laparoscope. It is inserted into the abdomen through a small incision. An incision is a small a cut made through the skin during surgery. The tube has a camera attached to it. The camera sends images to a video monitor. This allows a surgeon to view the inside of the body without major trauma to the patient.Laparoscopy is known as minimally invasive surgery. It allows for shorter hospital stays, faster recovery, less pain, and smaller scars than traditional (open) surgery.Other names: diagnostic laparoscopy, laparoscopic surgery
","What is it used for?
For people with abdominal symptoms, laparoscopic surgery may be used to diagnose:

Tumors and other growths
Blockages
Unexplained bleeding
Infections

For women, it may be used to diagnose and/or treat:

Fibroids, growths that form inside or outside the uterus. Most fibroids are noncancerous.
Ovarian cysts, fluid-filled sacs that form inside or on the surface of an ovary.
Endometriosis, a condition in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside of it.
Pelvic prolapse, a condition in which the reproductive organs drop into or out of the vagina.

It may also be used to:

Remove an ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy that grows outside the uterus. A fertilized egg can't survive an ectopic pregnancy. It can be life threatening for a pregnant woman.
Perform a hysterectomy, the removal of the uterus. A hysterectomy may be done to treat cancer, abnormal bleeding, or other disorders.
Perform a tubal ligation, a procedure used to prevent pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes.
Treat incontinence, accidental or involuntary urine leakage.

The surgery is sometimes used when a physical exam and/or imaging tests, such as x-rays or ultrasounds, don't give enough information to make a diagnosis.
","Why do I need a laparoscopy?You may need a laparoscopy if you:Have severe and/or chronic pain in your abdomen or pelvisFeel a lump in your abdomenHave abdominal cancer. Laparoscopic surgery can remove some types of cancer.Are a woman with heavier than normal menstrual periodsAre a woman who wants a surgical form of birth controlAre a woman having trouble getting pregnant. A laparoscopy can be used to check for blockages in the fallopian tubes and other conditions that can affect fertility.
","What happens during a laparoscopy?Laparoscopic surgery is usually done in a hospital or outpatient clinic. It usually includes the following steps:You will remove your clothing and put on a hospital gown.You will lay on an operating table.Most laparoscopies are done while you are under general anesthesia. General anesthesia is a medicine that makes you unconscious. It makes sure you won't feel any pain during the surgery. You will be given the medicine through an intravenous (IV) line or by inhaling gases from a mask. A specially trained doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you this medicineIf you are not given general anesthesia, a medicine will be injected in your abdomen to numb the area so you won't feel any pain.Once you are unconscious or your abdomen is completely numb, your surgeon will make a small incision just below your belly button, or near that area.The laparoscope, a thin tube with a camera attached, will be inserted through the incision.More small incisions may be made if a probe or other surgical tools are needed. A probe is a surgical instrument used to explore internal areas of the body.During the procedure, a type of gas will be put into your abdomen. This expands the area, making it easier for the surgeon to see inside your body.The surgeon will move the laparoscope around the area. He or she will view the images of the abdomen and pelvic organs on a computer screen.After the procedure is done, the surgical tools and most of the gas will be removed. The small incisions will be closed up.You will be moved to a recovery room.You may feel sleepy and/or nauseous for a few hours after the laparoscopy.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?If you will be getting general anesthesia, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for six or more hours before your surgery. You may not even be able to drink water during this period. Ask your health care provider about specific instructions. Also, if you are getting general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.In addition, you should wear loose-fitting clothes. Your abdomen may feel a little sore after the surgery.
","Are there any risks to the test?Many people have mild abdominal pain or discomfort afterward. Serious problems are uncommon. But they can include bleeding at the incision site and infection.
","What do the results mean?Your results may include diagnosing and/or treating one of the following conditions:EndometriosisFibroidsOvarian cystsEctopic pregnancyIn some cases, your provider may remove a piece of tissue to test for cancer.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

legionella tests,"What are Legionella tests?
Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. Legionella tests look for these bacteria in urine, sputum, or blood. Legionnaires' disease got its name in 1976 after a group of people attending an American Legion convention became ill with pneumonia.
Legionella bacteria can also cause a milder, flu-like illness called Pontiac fever. Together, Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever are known as legionellosis.
Legionella bacteria are found naturally in freshwater environments. But the bacteria can make people sick when it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These include plumbing systems of large buildings, including hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, and cruise ships. The bacteria may then contaminate water sources, such as hot tubs, fountains, and air-conditioning systems.
Legionellosis infections happen when people breathe in mist or small drops of water that contain the bacteria. The bacteria do not spread from person to person. But a disease outbreak can occur when many people are exposed to the same contaminated water source.
Not everyone who is exposed to Legionella bacteria will get sick. You are more likely to develop an infection you are:

Over the age of 50
A current or former smoker
Have a chronic disease such as diabetes or kidney failure
Have a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV/AIDS or cancer, or are taking medicines that suppress the immune system

While Pontiac fever usually clears up on its own, Legionnaires' disease can be fatal if not treated. Most people will recover if promptly treated with antibiotics.
Other names: Legionnaires' disease testing, Legionellosis testing
","What are they used for?
Legionella tests are used to find out whether you have Legionnaires' disease. Other lung diseases have symptoms similar to Legionnaires' disease. Getting the right diagnosis and treatment may help prevent life-threatening complications.
","Why do I need a Legionella test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of Legionnaires' disease. Symptoms usually show up two to 10 days after exposure to Legionella bacteria and may include:

Cough
High fever
Chills
Headache
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea

","What happens during a Legionella test?
Legionella tests may be done in urine, sputum, or blood.
During a urine test:
You will need to use the ""clean catch"" method to ensure your sample is sterile. The clean catch method includes the following steps:

Wash your hands.
Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad.
Start to urinate into the toilet.
Move the collection container under your urine stream.
Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amount.
Finish urinating into the toilet.
Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.

Sputum is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs when you have an infection. 
During a sputum test:

A health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup.
Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs.
If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a salty mist that can help you cough more deeply.

During a blood test:
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

lung cancer tumor markers,"What are lung cancer tumor marker tests?Lung cancer tumor markers are substances produced by tumor cells. Normal cells can turn into tumor cells due to a genetic mutation, a change in the normal function of genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.Some genetic mutations can be inherited from your parents. Others are acquired later in life due to environmental or lifestyle factors. The mutations that cause lung cancer are usually due to acquired, also known as somatic, mutations. These mutations are most often, though not always caused by a history of tobacco smoking. A genetic mutation can cause a lung tumor to spread and grow into cancer.There are different types of mutations that cause lung cancer. A lung cancer tumor marker test looks for the specific mutation that may be causing your cancer. The most commonly tested lung cancer markers include mutations in the following genes:EGFR, which makes a protein involved in cell divisionKRAS, which helps control the growth of tumorsALK, which is involved in cell growthNot all lung cancers are caused by genetic mutations. But if your cancer is caused by a mutation, you may be able to take a medicine that's designed to attack your specific type of mutated cancer cells. This is called targeted therapy.Other names: Lung cancer targeted gene panel
","What are they used for?Tests for lung cancer tumor markers are most often used to find out which, if any, genetic mutation is causing your lung cancer. Lung cancer markers may be tested individually or grouped together in one test.
","Why do I need a lung cancer tumor marker test?You may need a lung cancer tumor marker test if you have been diagnosed with a type of lung cancer called non-small cell lung cancer. This type of cancer is more likely to have a genetic mutation that will respond to targeted therapy.Targeted therapy is often more effective and causes fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation. But it's important to know which mutation you have. Targeted therapy medicines that are effective in someone with one type of mutation, might not work or may be dangerous to someone with a different mutation or no mutation.
","What happens during a lung cancer tumor marker test?A health care provider will need to take a small sample of the tumor in a procedure called a biopsy. It may be one of two types of biopsies:Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of  cells or fluidCore needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sampleFine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps:You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table.An x-ray or other imaging device may be used to locate the desired biopsy site. The skin will be marked.A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.Once the area is numb, the provider will make a small incision (cut) and insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the lung. Then he or she will remove a sample of tissue from the biopsy site.You may feel a little pressure when the needle enters the lung.Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops.Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the procedure. Talk to your health care provider if you have any questions about preparing for your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.
","What do the results mean?If your results show you have one of the lung cancer markers that may respond well to targeted therapy, your provider may start you on treatment right away. If your results show you do not have one of these lung cancer markers, you and your provider may discuss other treatment options.Genetic testing takes longer than many other types of lab tests. You may not get your results for a few weeks.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about lung cancer tumor marker tests?If you have lung cancer, it's important to see your health care provider regularly throughout your treatment and afterward.

This is done so you'll breathe through your mouth, rather than your nose.You'll be given a mouthpiece that is attached to a machine called a spirometer.You'll place your lips tightly around the mouthpiece, and breathe in and out as instructed by your provider.The spirometer will measure the amount and rate of air flow over a period of time.For a lung volume (body plethysmography) test:You'll sit in a clear, airtight room that looks like a telephone booth.As with a spirometry test, you'll wear a nose clip and place your lips around a mouthpiece connected to a machine.You'll breathe in and breathe out as instructed by your provider.The pressure changes inside the room help measure lung volume.For a gas diffusion test:You'll wear a mouthpiece connected to a machine.You will be asked to inhale (breathe in) a very small, nondangerous amount of carbon monoxide or other type of gas.Measurements will either be taken as you breathe in or as you breathe out.The test can show how effective your lungs are in moving gases to your bloodstream.For an exercise test, you will:Ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill.You'll be attached to monitors and machines that will measure blood oxygen, blood pressure, and heartbeat.This helps show how well your lungs perform during exercise.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the tests?To prepare for a lung function test, you'll need to take some steps to ensure your breathing is normal and unrestricted. These include:Don't eat a heavy meal before the test.Avoid food or drinks with caffeine.Don't smoke or do heavy exercise for six hours before the test.Wear loose, comfortable clothing.If you wear dentures, you'll need to wear them during the test. They can help you form a tight seal around the mouthpiece.
","Are there any risks to the tests?There is very little risk to having a lung function test. Some people may feel lightheaded or dizzy during the procedure. Also, some people may feel claustrophobic during a lung volume test. If you have questions or concerns about the tests, talk to your health care provider.
","What do the results mean?If any of your lung function test results were not normal, it may mean you have a lung disease. There are two main types of lung diseases that can be diagnosed with a lung function test:Obstructive diseases. These diseases cause airways to become narrow, making it hard for air to flow out of the lungs. Obstructive lung diseases include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.Restrictive diseases. n these diseases, the lungs or chest muscles aren't able to expand enough. This reduces air flow and the ability to send oxygen into the bloodstream. Restrictive lung disorders include scleroderma, sarcoidosis, and pulmonary fibrosis.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about lung function tests?Your health care provider may order another test, called arterial blood gases (ABGs), in addition to your lung function tests. ABGs measure the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.
"
luteinizing hormone (lh) levels test,"What is a luteinizing hormone (LH) levels test?This test measures the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your blood. LH is made by your pituitary gland, a small gland located underneath the brain. LH plays an important role in sexual development and functioning.In women, LH helps control the menstrual cycle. It also triggers the release of an egg from the ovary. This is known as ovulation. LH levels quickly rise just before ovulation.In men, LH causes the testicles to make testosterone, which is important for producing sperm. Normally, LH levels in men do not change very much.In children, LH levels are usually low in early childhood, and begin to rise a couple of years before the start of puberty. In girls, LH helps signal the ovaries to make estrogen. In boys, it helps signal the testes to make testosterone.Too much or too little LH can cause a variety of problems, including infertility (the inability to get pregnant), menstrual difficulties in women, low sex drive in men, and early or delayed puberty in children.Other names: lutropin, interstitial cell stimulating hormone
","What is it used for?An LH test works closely with another hormone called follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to control sexual functions. So an FSH test is often done along with an LH test. These tests are used in different ways, depending on whether you are a woman, man, or child.In women, these tests are most often used to:Help find the cause of infertilityFind out when ovulation occurs, this is the time when you are most likely to get pregnant.Find the reason for irregular or stopped menstrual periods.Confirm the start of menopause, or perimenopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old. Perimenopause is the transition period before menopause. It can last for several years. LH testing may be done towards the end of this transition.In men, these tests are most often used to:Help find the cause of infertilityFind the reason for a low sperm countFind the reason for low sex driveIn children, these tests are most often used to help diagnose early or delayed puberty.Puberty is considered early if it starts before age 9 in girls and before age 10 in boys.Puberty is considered delayed if hasn't started by age 13 in girls and by age 14 in boys.
","Why do I need an LH test?If you are a woman, you may need this test if:You've been unable to get pregnant after 12 months of trying.Your menstrual cycle is irregular.Your periods have stopped. The test may be used to find out if you have gone through menopause or are in perimenopause.If you are a man, you may need this test if:You've been unable to get your partner pregnant after 12 months of trying.Your sex drive is decreased.Both men and women may need testing if they have symptoms of a pituitary disorder. These include some of the symptoms listed above, as well as:FatigueWeaknessWeight lossDecreased appetiteYour child may need an LH test if he or she is does not seem to be starting puberty at the right age (either too early or too late).
","What happens during an LH levels test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?If you are a woman that has not gone through menopause, your provider may want to schedule your test at a specific time during your menstrual cycle.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?The meaning of your results will depend on whether you are a woman, man, or child.If you are woman, high LH levels may mean you:Are not ovulating. If you are of childbearing age, this may mean you have a problem in your ovaries. If you are older, it may mean you have started menopause or are in perimenopause.Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.Have Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder affects sexual development in females. It often causes infertility.If you are woman, low LH levels may mean:Your pituitary gland is not working correctly.You have an eating disorder.You have malnutrition.If you are a man, high LH levels may mean:Your testicles have been damaged due chemotherapy, radiation, infection, or alcohol abuse.You have Klinefelter's syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects sexual development in males. It often causes infertilityIf you are a man, low LH levels may mean you have a disorder of the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls the pituitary gland and other important body functions.In children, high LH levels, along with high levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, may mean puberty is about to start or has already started. If this is happening before age 9 in a girl or before age 10 in a boy (precocious puberty), it may be a sign of:A disorder of the central nervous systemsA brain injuryLow LH and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in children may mean be a sign of delayed puberty. Delayed puberty may be caused by:A disorder of the ovaries or testiclesTurner syndrome in girlsKlinefelter's syndrome in boysAn infectionA hormone deficiencyAn eating disorderIf you have questions about your results or child's results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an LH test?There is an at-home test that measures LH levels in urine. The kit is designed to detect the rise in LH that happens just before ovulation. This test may help you figure out when you will be ovulating and have the best chances of getting pregnant. But you should not use this test to prevent pregnancy. It is not reliable for that purpose.
"
lyme disease tests,"What are Lyme disease tests?
Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria carried by ticks. Lyme disease tests look for signs of infection in your blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
You can get Lyme disease if an infected tick bites you. Ticks can bite you anywhere on your body, but they usually bite in hard-to-see parts of your body such as the groin, scalp, and armpits. The ticks that cause Lyme disease are tiny, as small as a speck of dirt. So you may not know you have been bitten.
If left untreated, Lyme disease can cause serious health problems affecting your joints, heart, and nervous system. But if diagnosed early, most cases of Lyme disease can be cured after a few weeks of treatment with antibiotics.
Other names: Lyme antibodies detection, Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies test, Borrelia DNA Detection, IgM/IgG by Western Blot, Lyme disease test (CSF), Borrelia antibodies, IgM/IgG

","What are they used for?
Lyme disease tests are used to find out if you have a Lyme disease infection.

","Why do I need a Lyme disease test?
You may need a Lyme disease test if you have symptoms of infection. The first symptoms of Lyme disease usually show up between three and 30 days after the tick bite. They may include:

A distinctive skin rash that looks like a bull's-eye (a red ring with a clear center)
Fever
Chills
Headache
Fatigue
Muscle aches

You may also need a Lyme disease test if you don't have symptoms, but are at risk for infection. You may be at a higher risk if you:

Recently removed a tick from your body
Walked in a heavily wooded area, where ticks live, without covering exposed skin or wearing repellent 
Have done either of the above activities and live in or have recently visited the northeast or midwestern areas of the United States, where most Lyme disease cases occur

Lyme disease is most treatable in its early stages, but you may still benefit from testing later on. Symptoms that may show up weeks or months after the tick bite. They may include:

Severe headache
Neck stiffness
Severe joint pain and swelling
Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet
Memory and sleep disorders


","What happens during Lyme disease testing?
Lyme disease testing is usually done with your blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
For a Lyme disease blood test:

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

If you have symptoms of Lyme disease affecting your nervous system, such as neck stiffness and numbness in hands or feet, you may need a test of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear liquid found in your brain and spinal cord. During this test, your CSF will be collected through a procedure called a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. During the procedure:

You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.
A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you  won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.
Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.
Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.
You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.
Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a Lyme disease blood test. 
For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.

","Are there any risks to Lyme disease tests?
There is very little risk to having a blood test or a lumbar puncture. If you had a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly. If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure.

","What do the results mean?
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a two-test process of your sample:

If your first test result is negative for Lyme disease, you don't need any more testing.
If your first result is positive for Lyme disease, your blood will get a second test.
If both results are positive for Lyme disease and you also have symptoms of infection, you probably have Lyme disease.

Positive results don't always mean a Lyme disease diagnosis. In some cases, you can have a positive result but not have an infection. Positive results may also mean you have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
If your lumbar puncture results are positive, it may mean you have Lyme disease, but you might need more tests to confirm a diagnosis.
If your health care provider thinks you have Lyme disease, he or she will prescribe antibiotic treatment. Most people who are treated with antibiotics in the early stage of disease will make a complete recovery.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about Lyme disease tests?
You can reduce your chances of getting Lyme disease by taking the following steps:

Avoid walking in wooded areas with high grass.
Walk in the center of trails.
Wear long pants and tuck them into your boots or socks.
Apply an insect repellent containing DEET to your skin and clothing.

magnesium blood test,"What is a magnesium blood test?A magnesium blood test measures the amount of magnesium in your blood. Magnesium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that are responsible for many important functions and processes in your body.Your body needs magnesium to help your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. Magnesium also helps control blood pressure and blood sugar.Most of your body's magnesium is in your bones and cells. But a small amount is found in your blood. Magnesium levels in the blood that are too low or too high can be a sign of a serious health problem.Other names: Mg, Mag, Magnesium-Serum
","What is it used for?A magnesium blood test is used to check to see if you have too little or too much magnesium in the blood. Having too little magnesium, known as hypomagnesemia or magnesium deficiency, is more common than having too much magnesium, which is known as hypermagnesemia.A magnesium blood test is also sometimes included with tests of other electrolytes, such as sodium, calcium, potassium, and chloride.
","Why do I need a magnesium blood test?Your health care provider may order a magnesium blood test if you have symptoms of low magnesium or high magnesium levels.Symptoms of low magnesium include:WeaknessMuscle cramps and/or twitchingConfusionIrregular heartbeatSeizures (in severe cases)Symptoms of high magnesium include:Muscle weaknessFatigueNausea and vomitingTrouble breathingCardiac arrest, the sudden stopping of the heart (in severe cases)You may also need this test if you are pregnant.

malaria tests,"What are malaria tests?Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite. Parasites are tiny plants or animals that get nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites that cause malaria are passed to humans through the bite of infected mosquitos. At first, malaria symptoms may be similar to those of the flu. Later on, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications.Malaria is not contagious like a cold or flu, but it can be spread from person to person by mosquitos. If a mosquito bites an infected person, it will spread the parasite to anyone it bites afterward. If you are bitten by an infected mosquito, the parasites will travel into your bloodstream. The parasites will multiply inside your red blood cells and cause illness. Malaria tests look for signs of a malaria infection in the blood.Malaria is common in tropical and subtropical areas. Every year, millions of people are infected with malaria, and hundreds of thousands of people die from the disease. Most people who die from malaria are young children in Africa. While malaria is found in more than 87 countries, most infections and deaths happen in Africa. Malaria is rare in the United States. But U.S. citizens who travel to Africa and other tropical countries are at risk for getting infected.Other names: malaria blood smear, malaria rapid diagnostic test, malaria by PCR
","What are they used for?Malaria tests are used to diagnose malaria. If malaria is diagnosed and treated early, it can usually be cured. Left untreated, malaria can lead to life-threatening complications, including kidney failure, liver failure, and internal bleeding.
","Why do I need a malaria test?You may need this test if you live or have recently traveled to an area where malaria is common and you have symptoms of malaria. Most people will have symptoms within 14 days of being bitten by an infected mosquito. But symptoms can show up as soon as seven days afterward or can take as long as a year to appear. In the early stages of infection, malaria symptoms are similar to the flu, and may include:FeverChillsFatigueHeadacheBody achesNausea and vomitingIn the later stages of infection, symptoms are more serious and may include:High feverShivering and chillsConvulsionsBloody stoolsJaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)SeizuresMental confusion
","What happens during a malaria test?

mcv (mean corpuscular volume),"What is an MCV blood test?MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. There are three main types of corpuscles (blood cells) in your blood–red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes. Red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are too small or too large, it could be a sign of a blood disorder such as anemia, a vitamin deficiency, or other medical condition.Other names: CBC with differential

measles and mumps tests,"What are measles and mumps tests?
Measles and mumps are infections caused by similar viruses. They are both very contagious, meaning they easily spread from person to person. Measles and mumps mostly affect children.

Measles can make you feel like you have a bad cold or the flu. It will also cause a flat, red rash. This rash usually starts on your face and spreads all over your body.
Mumps can also make you feel like you have the flu. It causes painful swelling of the salivary glands. These glands are located in your cheek and jaw area.

Most people with measles or mumps infections will get better in about two weeks or less. But sometimes these infections can cause serious complications, including meningitis (swelling of the brain and spinal cord) and encephalitis (a type of infection in the brain). Measles and mumps testing can help your health care provider find out if you or your child has been infected with one of the viruses. It may also help prevent the spread of these diseases in your community.
Other names: measles immunity test, mumps immunity test, measles blood test, mumps blood test, measles viral culture, measles viral culture

","What are the tests used for?
Measles testing and mumps testing can be used to:

Find out whether you have an active infection of measles or mumps. An active infection means you have symptoms of the illness.
Find out whether you are immune to measles or mumps because you've been vaccinated or have had either virus before.
Help public health officials track and monitor outbreaks of measles or mumps.


","Why do I need a measles or mumps test?
Your health care provider may order tests if you or your child has symptoms of measles or mumps.
Symptoms of measles include:

Rash that starts on the face and spreads to the chest and legs
High fever
Cough
Runny nose
Sore throat
Itchy, red eyes
Tiny white spots in the mouth

Symptoms of mumps include:

Swollen, painful jaw
Puffy cheeks
Headache
Earache
Fever
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
Painful swallowing


","What happens during measles and mumps tests?


A blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Swab test. Your health care provider will use a special swab to take a sample from your nose or throat.
Nasal aspirate. Your health care provider will inject a saline solution into your nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction.
Spinal tap, if meningitis or encephalitis is suspected. For a spinal tap, your health care provider will insert a thin, hollow needle into your spine and withdraw a small amount of fluid for testing.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for these tests?
You don't need any special preparations for measles testing or mumps testing.

","Are there any risks to these tests?
There is very little risk to measles or mumps testing.

For a swab test, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle when your throat or nose is swabbed.
The nasal aspirate may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.
For a spinal tap, you may feel a little pinch or pressure when the needle is inserted. Some people may get a headache after the procedure.


","What do the results mean?
If your test results are negative, it likely means you do not have and have never been exposed to measles or mumps. If your test results are positive, it can mean one of the following:

A measles diagnosis
A mumps diagnosis
You have been vaccinated for the measles and/or mumps
You have had a previous infection of measles and/or mumps

If you (or your child) tests positive for measles and/or mumps and have symptoms of illness, you should stay at home for several days to recover. This will also help make sure you don't spread the disease. Your health care provider will let you know how long you will be contagious and when it will be okay to return to your regular activities.
If you've been vaccinated or have had a previous infection, your results will show that you have been exposed to the measles virus and/or mumps virus at one time in your life. But you will not be sick or have any symptoms. It also means you should be protected from getting sick in the future. Vaccination is the best protection against measles and mumps and their complications.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that children get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine; one in infancy, the other before starting school. Talk to your child's pediatrician for more information. If you are an adult, and don't know if you have been vaccinated or were ever sick with the viruses, talk to your health care provider.  Measles and mumps tend to make adults sicker than children.
If you have questions about your test results or your vaccination status, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about measles and mumps tests?
Instead of separate measles and mumps tests, your health care provider may order a combination blood test called an MMR antibody screening. MMR stands for measles, mumps, and rubella. Rubella, also known as German measles, is another type of viral infection.
"
measuring blood pressure,"What is a blood pressure measurement?
Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries. A blood pressure measurement is a test that measures the force (pressure) in your arteries as your heart pumps. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers:

Systolic blood pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when the heart beats.
Diastolic blood pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside the artery when the heart rests between beats.

High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, affects tens of millions of adults in the United States. It increases the risk of life-threatening conditions including heart attack and stroke. But high blood pressure rarely causes symptoms. A blood pressure measurement helps diagnose high blood pressure early, so it may be treated before it leads to serious complications.
Other names: blood pressure reading, blood pressure test, blood pressure screening, sphygmomanometry
","What is it used for?
A blood pressure measurement is most often used to diagnose high blood pressure.
Blood pressure that's too low, known as hypotension, is much less common. But you may get tested for low blood pressure if you have certain symptoms. Unlike high blood pressure, low blood pressure usually causes symptoms. These include:

Dizziness or lightheadedness
Nausea
Cold, sweaty skin
Pale skin
Fainting
Weakness

","Why do I need a blood pressure test?
A blood pressure measurement is often included as part of a regular checkup. Adults 18 years and older should have their blood pressure measured at least once every two to five years. You should get tested every year if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk if you:

Are 40 years old or older
Are overweight or have obesity
Have a family history of heart disease or diabetes
Take birth control pills
Are Black/African American. Black/African Americans have a higher rate of high blood pressure than other racial and ethnic groups

You may need this test if you have symptoms of low blood pressure.
","What happens during a blood pressure test?
A blood pressure test includes the following steps:

You will sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor.
You will rest your arm on a table or other surface, so your arm is level with your heart. You may be asked to roll up your sleeve.
Your provider will wrap a blood pressure cuff around your arm. A blood pressure cuff is a strap-like device. It should fit snugly around your upper arm, with the bottom edge placed just above your elbow.
Your provider will inflate the blood pressure cuff using a small hand pump or by pressing a button on an automated device.
Your provider will measure the pressure manually (by hand) or with an automated device.
    
If manually, he or she will place a stethoscope over the major artery in your upper arm to listen to the blood flow and pulse as the cuff inflates and deflates.
If using an automated device, the blood pressure cuff automatically inflates, deflates, and measures pressure.


As the blood pressure cuff inflates, you'll feel it tighten around your arm.
Your provider will then open a valve on the cuff to slowly release air from it. As the cuff deflates, blood pressure will fall.
As the pressure falls, a measurement is taken when the sound of blood pulsing is first heard. This is the systolic pressure.
As the air continues to be let out, the blood pulsing sound will start to go away. When it completely stops, another measurement is taken. This is the diastolic pressure.

This test only takes about one minute to complete.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a blood pressure measurement.
","Are there any risks to the test?
You may have a little discomfort when the blood pressure cuff inflates and squeezes your arm. But this feeling only lasts for a few seconds.
","What do the results mean?
Your results, also known as a blood pressure reading, will contain two numbers. The top or first number is the systolic pressure. The bottom or second number is the diastolic pressure. High blood pressure readings are also labeled by categories, ranging from normal to crisis. Your reading may show your blood pressure is:

Blood Pressure Category
Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure

Normal
Less than 120
and
Less than 80
High Blood Pressure (no other heart risk factors)
140 or higher
or
90 or higher
High Blood Pressure (with other heart risk factors, according to some providers)
130 or higher
or
80 or higher
Dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away
180 or higher
and
120 or higher

If you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes and/or medicines to control your blood pressure. Your provider may also recommend that you regularly check your blood pressure at home with an automated blood pressure monitor. An at-home blood pressure monitor usually includes a blood pressure cuff and a digital device to record and display blood pressure readings.
Home monitoring is not a replacement for regular visits to your provider. But it can provide important information, such as whether treatment is working or your condition may have worsened. Also, home monitoring may make the test less stressful. Many people get nervous about getting their blood pressure taken at a provider's office. This is called ""white coat syndrome."" It can cause a temporary rise in blood pressure, making the results less accurate. 
For more information about home monitoring of blood pressure, talk to your provider.

If you were tested for low blood pressure, a blood pressure reading of 90 systolic, 60 diastolic (90/60) or lower is considered abnormal. Treatments for low blood pressure may include medicines and making certain changes to your diet.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a blood pressure measurement?
If you were diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend one or more of the following lifestyle changes.

Exercise regularly. Staying active can help lower your blood pressure and also help manage your weight. Most adults should aim for 150 minutes of physical activity per week. Check with your provider before beginning an exercise program.
Keep a healthy weight. If you are overweight, losing as little as 5 pounds can lower your blood pressure.
Eat a healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetable, and whole grains. Limit foods high in saturated fat and total fat.
Reduce salt in your diet. Most adults should have less than 1500 mg of salt per day.
Limit alcohol use. If you choose to drink, limit yourself to one drink a day if you are a woman; two drinks a day if you're a man.
Don't smoke.

methylmalonic acid (mma) test,"What is a methylmalonic acid (MMA) test?
This test measures the amount of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in your blood or urine. MMA is a substance made in small amounts during metabolism. Metabolism is the process of how your body changes food into energy. Vitamin B12 plays an important role in metabolism. If your body doesn't have enough vitamin B12, it will make extra amounts of MMA. High MMA levels can be a sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to serious health problems including anemia, a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal amount of red blood cells.
Other names: MMA
","What is it used for?
An MMA test is most often used to diagnose a vitamin B12 deficiency.
This test is also used to diagnose methylmalonic acidemia, a rare genetic disorder. It is usually included as part of a series of tests called a newborn screening. A newborn screening helps diagnose a variety of serious health conditions.
","Why do I need an MMA test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a vitamin B12 deficiency. These include:

Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Tingling in hands and/or feet
Mood changes
Confusion
Irritability
Pale skin

If you have a new baby, he or she will probably be tested as part of a newborn screening.
","What happens during an MMA test?
MMA levels may be checked in blood or urine. 
During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
During a newborn screening, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.
MMA urine testing may be ordered as a 24-hour urine sample test or a random urine test.
For a 24-hour urine sample test, you'll need to collect all urine passed in a 24-hour period. Your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test generally includes the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine away. Record the time.
For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.
Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.
Return the sample container to your health care provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

For a random urine test, your sample of urine may be collected any time of the day.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to you or your baby during an MMA blood test. You may experience slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
There is no known risk to having a urine test.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show higher than normal levels of MMA, it may mean you have a vitamin B12 deficiency. The test can't show how much of a deficiency you have or whether your condition is likely to get better or worse. To help make a diagnosis, your results may be compared with other tests including a homocysteine blood test and/or vitamin B tests.
Lower than normal levels of MMA are not common and not considered a health problem.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
If your baby has moderate or high levels of MMA, it may mean he or she has methylmalonic acidemia. Symptoms of the disorder can range from mild to severe and may include vomiting, dehydration, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. Left untreated, it can cause life-threatening complications. If your baby is diagnosed with this disorder, talk to your child's health care provider about treatment options.

microalbumin creatinine ratio,"What is a microalbumin creatinine ratio?
Microalbumin is a small amount of a protein called albumin. It is normally found in the blood.  Creatinine is a normal waste product found in urine. A microalbumin creatinine ratio compares the amount of albumin to the amount of creatinine in your urine.
If there is any albumin in your urine, the amount can vary greatly throughout the day. But creatinine is released as a steady rate.  Because of this, your health care provider can more accurately measure the amount of albumin by comparing it to the amount of creatinine in your urine. If albumin is found in your urine, it may mean you have a problem with your kidneys.
Other names: albumin-creatinine ratio; urine albumin; microalbumin, urine; ACR; UACR

","What is it used for?
A microalbumin creatinine ratio is most often used to screen people who are at higher risk for kidney disease. These include people with diabetes or high blood pressure. Identifying kidney disease at an early stage can help prevent serious complications.

","Why do I need a microalbumin creatinine ratio?
You may need this test if you have diabetes. The American Diabetes Association recommends:

People with type 2 diabetes get tested every year
People with type 1 diabetes get tested every five years

If you have high blood pressure, you may get a microalbumin creatinine ratio at regular intervals, as recommended by your health care provider.

","What happens during a microalbumin creatinine ratio?
For a microalbumin creatinine ratio you will be asked to provide either a 24-hour urine sample or a random urine sample.
For a 24-hour urine sample, you will need to collect all urine passed in a 24-hour period. Your health care provider or a laboratory professional will give you a container to collect your urine and instructions on how to collect and store your samples. A 24-hour urine sample test usually includes the following steps:

Empty your bladder in the morning and flush that urine down. Do not collect this urine. Record the time.
For the next 24 hours, save all your urine passed in the container provided.
Store your urine container in the refrigerator or a cooler with ice.
Return the sample container to your health provider's office or the laboratory as instructed.

For a random urine sample, you will receive a container in which to collect the urine and special instructions to ensure the sample is sterile. These instructions are often referred to as the ""clean catch method."" The clean catch method includes the following steps:

Wash your hands.
Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.
Start to urinate into the toilet.
Move the collection container under your urine stream.
Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amount.
Finish urinating into the toilet.
Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a microalbumin creatinine ratio. 

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no known risk to a 24-hour urine sample or a random urine sample.

","What do the results mean?
If your microalbumin creatinine ratio shows albumin in your urine, you may get tested again to confirm the results. If your results continue to show albumin in urine, it may mean you have early-stage kidney disease. If your test results show high levels of albumin, it may mean you have kidney failure. If you are diagnosed with kidney disease, your health care provider will take steps to treat the disease and/or prevent further complications.
If small amounts of albumin are found in your urine, it doesn't necessarily mean you have kidney disease. Urinary tract infections and other factors can cause albumin to show up in urine. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a microalbumin creatinine ratio?
Be sure not to confuse ""prealbumin"" with albumin. Although they sound similar, prealbumin is a different type of protein. A prealbumin test is used to diagnose different conditions than a microalbumin creatinine ratio.
"
mononucleosis (mono) tests,"What are mononucleosis (mono) tests?
Mononucleosis (mono) is an infectious disease caused by a virus. The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the most common cause of mono, but other viruses can also cause the disease.
EBV is a type of herpes virus and is very common. Most Americans have been infected with EBV by the age of 40 but may never get symptoms of mono.
Young children infected with EBV usually have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.
Teens and young adults, though, are more likely to get mono and experience noticeable symptoms. In fact, at least one out of four teens and adults who get EBV will develop mono.
Mono can cause symptoms similar to those of the flu. Mono is rarely serious, but symptoms can linger for weeks or months. Mono is sometimes called the kissing disease because it is spread through saliva. You can also get mono if you share a drinking glass, food, or utensils with an a person who has mono.
Types of mono tests include:

Monospot test. This test looks for specific antibodies in the blood. These antibodies show up during or after during certain infections, including mono.
EBV antibody test. This test looks for EBV antibodies, the main cause of mono. There are different types of EBV antibodies. If certain types of antibodies are found, it may mean you were infected recently. Other types of EBV antibodies may mean you were infected in the past.

Other names: monospot test, mononuclear heterophile test, heterophile antibody test, EBV antibody test, Epstein-Barr virus antibodies
","What are they used for?
Mono tests are used to help diagnose a mono infection. Your provider may use a monospot to get fast results. Results are usually ready within an hour. But this test has a high rate of false negatives. So monospot tests are often ordered with an EVB antibody test and other tests that look for infections. These include:

Complete blood count and/or blood smear, which checks for high levels of white blood cells, a sign of infection.
Throat culture, to check for strep throat, which has similar symptoms to mono. Strep throat is a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections like mono.

","Why do I need a mono test? 
Your health care provider may order one or more mono tests if you or your child has symptoms of mono. Symptoms include:

Fever
Sore throat
Swollen glands, especially in the neck and/or armpits
Fatigue
Headache
Rash

","What happens during a mono test?
You will need to provide a sample of blood from your fingertip or from a vein.
For a fingertip blood test, a health care professional will prick your middle or ring finger with a small needle. After wiping away the first drop of blood, he or she will place a little tube on your finger and collect a small amount of blood. You may feel a pinch when the needle pricks your finger.
For a blood test from a vein, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
Both types of tests are quick, usually taking less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for a fingertip blood test or blood test from a vein.
","Are there any risks to mono tests
There is very little risk to having a fingertip blood test or blood test from a vein. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If monospot test results were positive, it may mean you or your child has mono. If it was negative, but you or your child still has symptoms, your health care provider will probably order an EBV antibody test.
If your EBV test was negative, it means you don't currently have an EBV infection and were never infected with the virus. A negative result means your symptoms are probably caused by another disorder.
If your EBV test was positive, it means EBV antibodies were found in your blood. The test will also show which types of antibodies were found. This allows your provider to find out whether you were infected recently or in the past.
While there is no cure for mono, you can take steps to relieve symptoms. These include:

Get plenty of rest
Drink lots of fluids
Suck on lozenges or hard candy to soothe a sore throat
Take over-the-counter relievers. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome, a serious, sometimes fatal, disease that affects the brain and liver.

Mono usually goes away on its own within a few weeks. Fatigue may last a bit longer. Health care providers recommend children avoid sports for at least a month after symptoms have gone. This helps avoid injury to the spleen, which may be at a higher risk for damage during and just after an active mono infection. If you have questions about your results or treatment for mono, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about mono tests?
Some people think that EBV causes a disorder called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). But as of now, researchers have not found any evidence to show this is true. So monospot and EBV tests are not used to diagnose or monitor CFS.

","Is there anything else I need to know about an MPV blood test?There are many factors that can affect the results of your MPV blood test. Living in high altitudes, strenuous physical activity, and certain drugs, such as birth control pills, may cause an increase in platelet levels. Decreased platelet levels may be caused by a women's menstrual cycle or pregnancy. In rare cases, platelets can be affected by a genetic defect.
"
mrsa tests,"What are MRSA tests?
MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. It is a type of staph bacteria. Many people have staph bacteria living on their skin or in their noses. These bacteria usually don't cause any harm. But when staph enters the body through a cut, scrape, or other open wound, it can cause a skin infection. Most staph skin infections are minor and heal on their own or after treatment with antibiotics.
MRSA bacteria are different than other staph bacteria. In a normal staph infection, antibiotics will kill the disease-causing bacteria and prevent them from growing. In a MRSA infection, the antibiotics usually used to treat staph infections don't work. The bacteria are not killed and continue to grow. When common antibiotics don't work on bacterial infections, it's known as antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance makes it very difficult to treat certain bacterial infections. Every year, nearly 3 million people in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and more than 35,000 people die from the infections.
In the past, MRSA infections mostly happened to hospital patients. Now, MRSA is becoming more common in healthy people. The infection can be spread from person to person or through contact with objects that are contaminated with the bacteria. It is not spread through the air like a cold or flu virus. But you can get a MRSA infection if you share personal items such as a towel or a razor. You may also get the infection if you have close, personal contact with someone who has an infected wound. This can happen when large groups of people are close together, such as in a college dorm, locker room, or military barracks.
A MRSA test looks for the MRSA bacteria in a sample from a wound, nostril, or other body fluid. MRSA can be treated with special, powerful antibiotics. If left untreated, a MRSA infection can lead to serious illness or death.
Other names: MRSA screening, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus screening
","What are they used for?
This test is most often used to find out if you have a MRSA infection. The test may also be used to see if treatment for a MRSA infection is working.
","Why do I need a MRSA test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a MRSA infection. Symptoms depend on where the infection is located. Most MRSA infections are in the skin, but the bacteria can spread to the bloodstream, lungs, and other organs.
A MRSA infection on the skin may look like a type of rash. A MRSA rash looks like red, swollen bumps on the skin. Some people may mistake a MRSA rash for a spider bite. The infected area may also be:

Warm to the touch
Painful

Symptoms of a MRSA infection in the bloodstream or other parts of the body include:

Fever
Chills
Headache
MRSA rash

","What happens during a MRSA test?
A health care provider will take a fluid sample from your wound, nose, blood, or urine. Steps may include the following:
Wound sample:

A provider will use a special swab to collect a sample from the site of your wound.

Nasal swab:

A provider will put a special swab inside each nostril and twirl it around to collect the sample.

Blood test:

A provider will take a sample of blood from a vein in your arm.

Urine test:

You will provide a sterile sample of urine in a cup, as instructed by your health care provider.

After your test, your sample will be sent to a lab for testing. Most tests take 24-48 hours to get results. That's because it takes time to grow enough bacteria to be detected. But a new test, called the cobas vivoDx MRSA test, can deliver results much faster. The test, which is done on nasal swabs, can find MRSA bacteria in as little as five hours.
Talk to your health care provider to see if this new test would be a good choice for you.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a MRSA test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a wound sample, swab, or urine test.
You may feel a little pain when a sample is taken from a wound. A nasal swab may be slightly uncomfortable. These effects are usually mild and temporary.
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results are positive, it means you have a MRSA infection. Treatment will depend on how serious the infection is. For mild skin infections, your provider may clean, drain, and cover the wound. You may also get an antibiotic to put on the wound or take by mouth. Certain antibiotics still work for some MRSA infections.
For more serious cases, you may need to go to the hospital and get treated with powerful antibiotics through an IV (intravenous line).
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about MRSA tests?
The following steps can reduce your risk of getting a MRSA infection:

Wash your hands often and thoroughly, using soap and water.
Keep cuts and scrapes clean and covered until they are fully healed.
Don't share personal items such as towels and razors.

You can also take steps to reduce antibiotic-resistant infections. Antibiotic resistance happens when people don't use antibiotics in the right way. To prevent antibiotic resistance:

Take antibiotics as prescribed, making sure to finish the medicine even after you feel better.
Don't use antibiotics if you don't have a bacterial infection. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections.
Don't use antibiotics prescribed for someone else.
Don't use old or leftover antibiotics.

mthfr mutation test,"What is an MTHFR mutation test?This test looks for mutations (changes) in a gene called MTHFR. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.Everyone has two MTHFR genes, one inherited from your mother and one from your father. Mutations can occur in one or both MTHFR genes. There are different types of MTHFR mutations. An MTHFR test looks for two of these mutations, also known as variants. The MTHFR variants are called C677T and A1298C.The MTHFR gene helps your body break down a substance called homocysteine. Homocysteine is a type of amino acid, a chemical your body uses to make proteins. Normally, folic acid and other B vitamins break down homocysteine and change it into other substances your body needs. There should then be very little homocysteine left in the bloodstream.If you have an MTHFR mutation, your MTHFR gene may not work right. This may cause too much homocysteine to build up in the blood, leading to various health problems, including:Homocystinuria, a disorder that affects the eyes, joints, and cognitive abilities. It usually starts in early childhood.An increased risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, and blood clotsIn addition, women with MTHFR mutations have a higher risk of having a baby with one of the following birth defects:Spina bifida, known as a neural tube defect. This is a condition in which the bones of the spine do not completely close around the spinal cord.Anencephaly, another type of neural tube defect. In this disorder, parts of the brain and/or skull may be missing or deformed.You can reduce your homocysteine levels by taking folic acid or other B vitamins These can be taken as supplements or added through dietary changes. If you need to take folic acid or other B vitamins, your health care provider will recommend which option is best for you.Other names: plasma total homocysteine, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase DNA mutation analysis
","What is it used for?This test is used to find out if you have one of two MTHFR mutations: C677T and A1298C. It is often used after other tests show you have higher than normal homocysteine levels in the blood. Conditions such as high cholesterol, thyroid disease, and dietary deficiencies can also raise homocysteine levels. An MTHFR test will confirm whether the raised levels are caused by a genetic mutation.Even though an MTHFR mutation brings a higher risk of birth defects, the test is not usually recommended for pregnant women. Taking folic acid supplements during pregnancy can greatly reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects. So most pregnant women are encouraged to take folic acid, whether or not they have an MTHFR mutation.
","Why do I need an MTHFR mutation test?You may need this test if:You had a blood test that showed higher than normal levels of homocysteineA close relative was diagnosed with an MTHFR mutationYou and/or close family members have a history of premature heart disease or blood vessel disordersYour new baby may also get an MTHFR test as part of routine newborn screening. A newborn screening is a simple blood test that checks for a variety of serious diseases.
","What happens during an MTHFR mutation test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.For a newborn screening, a health care professional will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. He or she will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.Testing is most often done when a baby is 1 to 2 days old, usually in the hospital where he or she was born. If your baby wasn't born in the hospital or if you have left the hospital before the baby could be tested, talk to your health care provider about scheduling testing as soon as possible.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an MTHFR mutation test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to you or your baby with MTHFR testing. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Your results will show whether you are positive or negative for an MTHFR mutation. If positive, the result will show which of the two mutations you have, and whether you have one or two copies of the mutated gene. If your results were negative, but you have high homocysteine levels, your health care provider may order more tests to find out the cause.Regardless of the reason for high homocysteine levels, your health care provider may recommend taking folic acid and/or other vitamin B supplements, and/or changing your diet. B vitamins can help bring your homocysteine levels back to normal.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an MTHFR mutation test?Some health care providers choose to only test for homocysteine levels, rather than doing a MTHFR gene test. That is because treatment is often the same, whether or not high homocysteine levels are caused by a mutation.

mucus in urine,"How do you test for mucus in urine?Mucus is a thick, slimy substance that coats and moistens certain parts of the body, including the nose, mouth, throat, and urinary tract. A small amount of mucus in your urine is normal. An excess amount may indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI) or other medical condition. A test called urinalysis can detect whether there is too much mucus in your urine.Other names: microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, urine test, urine analysis, UA
",,"Why do I need a mucus in urine test?A urinalysis is often part of a routine checkup. Your health care provider may include a mucus in urine test in your urinalysis if you have symptoms of a UTI. These include:Frequent urge to urinate, but little urine is passedPainful urinationDark, cloudy, or reddish-colored urineBad smelling urineWeaknessFatigue
","What happens during a mucus in urine test?Your health care provider will need to collect a sample of your urine. You will receive a container to collect the urine and special instructions to make sure that the sample is sterile. These instructions are often called the ""clean catch method."" The clean catch method includes the following steps:Wash your hands.Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.Start to urinate into the toilet.Move the collection container under your urine stream.Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container. The container will have markings to indicate the amounts.Finish urinating into the toilet.Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.

"
myelography,"What is myelography?
Myelography, also called a myelogram, is an imaging test that checks for problems in your spinal canal. The spinal canal contains your spinal cord, nerve roots, and the subarachnoid space. The subarachnoid space is a fluid-filled space between the spinal cord and the membrane that covers it. During the test, contrast dye is injected into the spinal canal. Contrast dye is a substance that makes specific organs, blood vessels, and tissue show up more clearly on an x-ray.
Myelography involves using one of these two imaging procedures:

Fluoroscopy, a type of x-ray that shows internal tissues, structures, and organs moving in real time.
CT scan (computerized tomography), a procedure that combines a series of x-ray images taken from different angles around the body.

Other names: myelogram 
","What is it used for?
Myelography is used to look for conditions and diseases that affect the nerves, blood vessels, and structures in the spinal canal. These include:

Herniated disk. Spinal disks are rubbery cushions (disks) that sit between the bones of your spine. A herniated disk is a condition in which the disk bulges out and presses on spinal nerves or the spinal cord.
Tumors
Spinal stenosis, a condition that causes swelling and damage to the bones and tissues around the spinal cord. This leads to narrowing of the spinal canal.
Infections, such as meningitis, that affect the membranes and tissues of the spinal cord
Arachnoiditis, a condition that causes inflammation of a membrane that covers the spinal cord

","Why do I need myelography?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a spinal disorder, such as:

Pain in the back, neck, and/or leg
Tingling sensations
Weakness
Trouble walking
Trouble with tasks that involve small muscle groups, such as buttoning a shirt

","What happens during myelography?
A myelography may be done at a radiology center or in the radiology department of a hospital. The procedure usually includes the following steps:

You may need to remove your clothing. If so, you will be given a hospital gown.
You will lie on your stomach on a padded x-ray table.
Your provider will clean your back with an antiseptic solution.
You will be injected with numbing medicine, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.
Once the area is numb, your provider will use a thin needle to inject contrast dye into your spinal canal. You may feel some pressure when the needle goes in, but it should not hurt.
Your provider may remove a sample of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) for testing.
Your x-ray table will be tilted in different directions to allow the contrast dye to move to different areas of the spinal cord.
Your provider will remove the needle.
Your provider will capture and record images using fluoroscopy or a CT scan.

After the test, you may be monitored for one to two hours. You may also be advised to lie down at home for a few hours and to avoid strenuous activity for one to two days after the test.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Your provider may ask you to drink extra fluids on the day before the test. On the day of the test, you will probably be asked to not eat or drink anything, except for clear fluids. These include water, clear broth, tea, and black coffee.
Talk to your provider about any medicines you are taking. Certain medicines, especially aspirin and blood thinners, should not be taken before your test. Your provider will let you know how long you need to avoid these medicines. It may be as long as 72 hours before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test? 
You should not take this test if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant. Radiation can be harmful to an unborn baby.
For others, there is little risk to having this test. The dose of radiation is very low and is not considered harmful for most people. But talk to your provider about all the x-rays you've had in the past. The risks from radiation exposure may be linked to the number of x-ray treatments you've had over time.
There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast dye. Tell your provider if you have any allergies, especially to shellfish or iodine, or if you've ever had a reaction to contrast material.
Other risks include headache and nausea and vomiting. The headache may last for up to 24 hours. Serious reactions are rare but may include seizures, infection, and a blockage in the spinal canal.
","What do the results mean?
If your results were not normal, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Herniated disk
Spinal stenosis
Tumor
Nerve injury
Bone spurs
Arachnoiditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the spinal cord)

A normal result means your spinal canal and structures were normal in size, position, and shape. Your provider may want to do more tests to find out what is causing your symptoms.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about myelography?
MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has replaced the need for myelography in many cases. MRIs  use a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of organs and structures inside the body. But myelography can be useful in diagnosing certain spinal tumors and spinal disk problems. It's also used for people who are unable to have an MRI because they have metal or electronic devices in their bodies. These include a pacemaker, surgical screws, and cochlear implants.

"natriuretic peptide tests (bnp, nt-probnp)","What are natriuretic peptide tests (BNP, NT-proBNP)?Natriuretic peptides are substances made by the heart. Two main types of these substances are brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Normally, only small levels of BNP and NT-proBNP are found in the bloodstream. High levels can mean your heart isn't pumping as much blood as your body needs. When this happens, it's known as heart failure, sometimes called congestive heart failure.Natriuretic peptide tests measure the levels of BNP or NT-proBNP in your blood. Your health care provider may order a BNP test or an NT-proBNP test, but not both. They are both useful in diagnosing heart failure, but rely on different types of measurements. The choice will depend on the equipment available in your provider's recommended laboratory.Other names: brain natriuretic peptide, NT-proB-type natriuretic peptide test, B-type natriuretic peptide

neurological exam,"What is a neurological exam?A neurological exam checks for disorders of the central nervous system. The central nervous system is made of your brain, spinal cord, and nerves from these areas. It controls and coordinates everything you do, including muscle movement, organ function, and even complex thinking and planning.There are more than 600 types of central nervous system disorders. The most common disorders include:Parkinson's diseaseMultiple sclerosisMeningitisEpilepsyStrokeMigraine headachesA neurological exam is made up of a series of tests. The tests examine your balance, muscle strength, and other functions of the central nervous system.Other names: neuro exam
","What is it used for?A neurological exam is used to help find out if you have a disorder of the nervous system. Early diagnosis can help you get the right treatment and may decrease long-term complications.
","Why do I need a neurological exam?You may need a neurological exam if you have symptoms of a nervous system disorder. Symptoms vary depending on the disorder, but common symptoms include:HeadacheProblems with balance and/or coordinationNumbness in the arms and/or legsBlurred visionChanges in hearing and/or your ability to smellChanges in behaviorSlurred speechConfusion or other changes in mental abilityWeaknessSeizuresFatigueFever
","What happens during a neurological exam?
A neurological exam is usually performed by a neurologist. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain and spinal cord. During the exam, your neurologist will test different functions of the nervous system. Most neurological exams include tests of the following:

Mental status. Your neurologist or other provider will ask you general questions, such as the date, place, and time. You may also be asked to perform tasks. These may include remembering a list of items, naming objects, and drawing specific shapes.
Coordination and balance. Your neurologist may ask you to walk in a straight line, placing one foot directly in front of the other. Other tests may include closing your eyes and touching your nose with your index finger.
Reflexes. A reflex is an automatic response to stimulation. Reflexes are tested by tapping different areas of the body with a small rubber hammer. If reflexes are normal, your body will move a certain way when tapped with the hammer. During a neurological exam, the neurologist may tap several areas on your body, including below your kneecap and areas around your elbow and ankle.
Sensation. Your neurologist will touch your legs, arms, and/or other body parts with different instruments. These may include a tuning fork, dull needle, and/or alcohol swabs. You will be asked to identify sensations such as heat, cold, and pain.
Cranial nerves. These are the nerves that connect your brain with your eyes, ears, nose, face, tongue, neck, throat, upper shoulders, and some organs. You have 12 pairs of these nerves. Your neurologist will test specific nerves depending on your symptoms. Testing may include identifying certain smells, sticking out your tongue and trying to speak, and moving your head from side to side. You may also get hearing and vision tests.
Autonomic nervous system. This is the system that controls basic functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. To test this system, your neurologist or other provider may check your blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate while you are sitting, standing, and/or lying down. Other tests may include checking your pupils in response to light and a test of your ability to sweat normally.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a neurological exam?You don't need any special preparations for a neurological exam.
","Are there any risks to the exam?There is no risk to having a neurological exam.
","What do the results mean?If results on any part of the exam were not normal, your neurologist will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. These tests may include one or more of the following:Blood and/or urine testsImaging tests such as an x-ray or MRIA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test. CSF is clear fluid that surrounds and cushions your brain and spinal cord. A CSF test takes a small sample of this fluid.Biopsy. This is a procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for further testing.Tests, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG), which use small electric sensors to measure brain activity and nerve functionIf you have questions about your results, talk to your neurologist or other health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a neurological exam?Nervous system disorders and mental health problems can have similar or the same symptoms. That's because some behavioral symptoms can be signs of a nervous system disorder. If you had a mental health screening that was not normal, or if you notice changes in your behavior, your provider may recommend a neurological exam.

nitrites in urine,"How do you test for nitrites in urine?A urinalysis, also called a urine test, can detect the presence of nitrites in the urine. Normal urine contains chemicals called nitrates. If bacteria enter the urinary tract, nitrates can turn into different, similarly named chemicals called nitrites. Nitrites in urine may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI).UTIs are one of the most common types of infections, especially in women. Fortunately, most UTIs are not serious and are usually treated with antibiotics. It's important to see your health care provider if you have symptoms of a UTI so you can start treatment right away.Other names: urine test, urine analysis, microscopic urine analysis, microscopic examination of urine, UA

obesity screening,"What is obesity screening?Obesity is the condition of having too much body fat. It's not just a matter of appearance. Obesity can put you at risk for a variety of chronic and serious health problems. These include:Heart diseaseType 2 diabetesHigh blood pressureArthritisCertain types of cancerExperts say obesity is major problem in the U.S. Today more than 30 percent of U.S. adults and 20 percent of U.S. children have obesity. Children with obesity are at risk for many of the same health problems as adults with obesity.An obesity screening may use a measurement called a BMI (body mass index) and other tests to find out if you or your child is overweight or has obesity. Being overweight means you have excess body weight. While not as severe as obesity, it may also lead to serious health problems.
","What is a BMI?A BMI (body mass index) is a calculation based on your weight and height. While it's hard to directly measure fat on the body, a BMI can provide a good estimate.To measure BMI, your health care provider may use an online tool or an equation that uses your weight and height information. You can measure your own BMI in much the same way by using an online BMI calculator.Your results will fall into one of these categories:Below 18.5: Underweight18.5-24.9: Healthy weight25 -29.9: Overweight30 and above: Obese40 or higher: Severely obese, also known as morbidly obeseBMI is also used to diagnose obesity in children, but it is figured out differently than in adults. Your child's health care provider will calculate BMI based on your child's age, sex, weight, and height. He or she will compare those numbers with the results of other children with similar characteristics.The results will be in the form of a percentile. A percentile is a type of comparison between an individual and a group. For example, if your child has a BMI in the 50th percentile, it means 50 percent of children of the same age and sex have a lower BMI. Your child's BMI will show one of the following results:Less than the 5th percentile: Underweight5th-84th percentile: Normal Weight85th-94th percentile: Overweight95th percentile and higher: Obese
","What causes obesity?
Obesity happens when you take in more calories than your body needs over a long period of time. A variety of factors can lead to obesity. For many people, dieting and willpower alone are not enough to control weight. Obesity may be caused by one or more of the following:

Diet. You are at a higher risk of obesity if your diet includes a lot of fast foods, packaged snacks, and sugary soft drinks.
Lack of exercise. If you don't get enough physical activity to burn off what you eat, you will likely gain weight.
Family history. You're more likely to become obese if close family members have obesity.
Aging. As you get older, your muscle tissue decreases and your metabolism slows down. This can lead to weight gain, and eventually obesity, even if you stayed at a healthy weight when you were younger.
Pregnancy. It's normal and healthy to gain weight during pregnancy. But if you don't lose the weight after pregnancy, it can cause long-term weight problems.
Menopause. Many women gain weight after menopause. This may be caused by changes in hormone levels and/or reduction in daily activities.
Biology. Our bodies have systems that help keep our weight at a healthy level. In some people, this system doesn't work right. This makes it especially hard to lose weight.
Hormonal disorders. Certain disorders cause your body to make too much or too little of important hormones. This may lead to weight gain, and sometimes obesity.

","What is an obesity screening used for?An obesity screening is used to find out if you or your child is at an unhealthy weight. If the screening shows that you or your child is overweight or has obesity, your provider will check to see if there is medical issue causing the excess weight. Your provider will also teach you about what you can do to reduce your weight and improve your health.
","Why do I need obesity screening?Most adults and children over the age of 6 should be screened at least once a year with a BMI. If your health care provider finds that you have a high or increasing BMI, he or she can recommend steps you can take to help prevent you from becoming overweight or obese.
","What happens during an obesity screening?In addition to a BMI, an obesity screening may include:A physical examA measurement around your waist. Excess fat around the waist can put you at an even higher risk for obesity-related health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.Blood tests to check for diabetes and/or medical conditions that may be causing weight gain.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for an obesity screening?You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for certain types of blood tests. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the screening?There is no risk to having a BMI or a waist measurement. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

obsessive compulsive disorder (ocd) test,"What is an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) test?
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder. It causes repeated unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions). To get rid of obsessions, people with OCD may perform certain actions over and over again (compulsions). Most people with OCD know that their compulsions don't make sense, but still can't stop doing them. Sometimes they feel these behaviors are the only way to prevent something bad from happening. Compulsions may temporarily relieve anxiety.
OCD is different than regular habits and routines. It's not unusual to brush your teeth at the same time every morning or sit in the same chair for dinner every night. With OCD, compulsive behaviors can take up several hours a day. They can get in the way of normal daily life.
OCD usually starts in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. Researchers don't know what causes OCD. But many believe genetics and/or a problem with chemicals in the brain may play a role. It often runs in families.
An OCD test can help diagnose the disorder so you can get treated. Treatment can reduce symptoms and improve quality of life.
Other names: OCD screening
","What is it used for?
This test is used to find out if certain symptoms are being caused by OCD.
","Why do I need an OCD test?
This test may be done if you or your child is having obsessive thoughts and/or showing compulsive behaviors.

opioid testing,"What is opioid testing?Opioid testing looks for the presence of opioids in urine, blood, or saliva. Opioids are powerful drugs that are used to relieve pain. They are often prescribed to help treat serious injuries or illnesses. In addition to reducing pain, opioids can also increase feelings of pleasure and well-being. Once an opioid dose wears off, it's natural to want those feelings to return. So even using opioids as prescribed by a doctor can lead to dependence and addiction.The terms ""opioids"" and ""opiates"" are often used in the same way. An opiate is a type of opioid that comes naturally from the opium poppy plant. Opiates include the medicines codeine and morphine, as well as the illegal drug heroin. Other opioids are synthetic (man-made) or part synthetic (part natural and part man-made). Both types are designed to produce effects similar to a naturally occurring opiate. These types of opioids include:Oxycodone (OxyContin®)Hydrocodone (Vicodin®)HydromorphoneOxymorphoneMethadoneFentanyl. Drug dealers sometimes add fentanyl to heroin. This combination of drugs is especially dangerous.Opioids are often misused, leading to overdoses and death. In the United States, tens of thousands of people die every year from opioid overdoses. Opioid testing can help prevent or treat addiction before it becomes dangerous.Other names: opioid screening, opiate screening, opiate testing
","What is it used for?Opioid testing is often used to monitor people who are taking prescription opioids. The test helps ensure you are taking the right amount of medicine.Opioid testing may also be included as part of an overall drug screening. These screenings test for a variety of drugs, such as marijuana and cocaine, as well as opioids. Drug screenings may be used for:Employment. Employers may test you before and/or after hiring to check for on-the-job drug use.Legal or forensic purposes. Testing may be part of a criminal or motor vehicle accident investigation. Drug screening may also be ordered as part of a court case.
","Why do I need opioid testing?You may need opioid testing if you are currently taking prescription opioids to treat chronic pain or another medical condition. The tests can tell if you are taking more medicine than you should, which can be a sign of addiction.You may also be asked to take a drug screening, which includes tests for opioids, as a condition of your employment or as part of a police investigation or court case.Your health care provider may also order opioid testing if you have symptoms of opioid abuse or overdose. Symptoms may start as lifestyle changes, such as:Lack of hygieneIsolation from family and friendsStealing from family, friends, or businessesFinancial difficultiesIf opioid abuse continues, physical symptoms may include:Slowed or slurred speechDifficulty breathingDilated or small pupilsDeliriumNausea and vomitingDrowsinessAgitationChanges in blood pressure or heart rhythm
","What happens during an opioid test?Most opioid tests require that you give a urine sample. You will be given instructions to provide a ""clean catch"" sample. During a clean catch urine test, you will:Wash your handsClean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.Start to urinate into the toilet.Move the collection container under your urine stream.Pass at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.Finish urinating into the toilet.Return the sample container to the lab technician or health care provider.In certain instances, a medical technician or other staff member may need to be present while you provide your sample.Other opioid tests require you to give samples of your blood or saliva.During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.During a saliva test:A health care provider will use a swab or absorbent pad to collect saliva from the inside of your cheek.The swab or pad will stay in your cheek for a few minutes to allow saliva to build up.Some providers may ask you to spit into a tube, rather than swabbing inside your cheek.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?Be sure to tell the testing provider or your health care provider if you are taking any prescription or over-the-counter medicines. Some of these may cause positive results for opioids. Poppy seeds can also cause a positive opioid result. So you should avoid foods with poppy seeds for up to three days before your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having a urine or saliva test. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.Although physical risks to testing are very small, a positive result on an opioid test may affect other aspects of your life, including your job or the outcome of a court case.
","What do the results mean?If your results are negative, it means no opioids were found in your body, or that you are taking the right amount of opioids for your health condition. But if you have symptoms of opioid abuse, your provider will probably order more tests.If your results are positive, it may mean that there are opioids in your system. If high levels of opioids are found, it may mean you are taking too much of a prescribed medicine or otherwise abusing drugs. False positives are possible, so your health care provider may order more tests to confirm a positive result.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about opioid testing?If your results show unhealthy opioid levels, it's important to get treatment. Opioid addiction can be deadly.If you are being treated for chronic pain, work with your health care provider to find ways to manage pain that don't include opioids. Treatments for anyone who is abusing opioids may include:MedicinesRehabilitation programs on an inpatient or outpatient basisOngoing psychological counselingSupport groups
"
osmolality tests,"What are osmolality tests?
Osmolality tests measure the amount of certain substances in blood, urine, or stool. These include glucose (sugar), urea (a waste product made in the liver), and several electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals. They help control the amount of fluids in your body. The test can show whether you have an unhealthy balance of fluids in your body. An unhealthy fluid balance can be caused by many different conditions. These include excess salt intake, kidney disease, heart disease, and some types of poisoning.
Other names: serum osmolality, plasma osmolality urine osmolality, stool osmolality, osmotic gap
","What are they used for?
Osmolality tests may be used for a variety of reasons. A blood osmolality test, also known as a serum osmolality test, is most often used to:

Check the balance between water and certain chemicals in the blood.
Find out if you have swallowed a poison such as antifreeze or rubbing alcohol
Help diagnose dehydration, a condition in which your body loses too much fluid
Help diagnose overhydration, a condition in which your body retains too much fluid
Help diagnose diabetes insipidus, a condition that affects the kidneys and can lead to dehydration

Sometimes blood plasma is also tested for osmolality. Serum and plasma are both parts of the blood. Plasma contains substances including blood cells and certain proteins. Serum is a clear fluid that does not contain these substances.
A urine osmolality test is often used along with a serum osmolality test to check the body's fluid balance. The urine test may also be used to find out the reason for increased or decreased urination.
A stool osmolality test is most often used to find out the reason for chronic diarrhea that is not caused by a bacterial or parasitic infection.
","Why do I need an osmolality test?
You may need a serum osmolality or urine osmolality test if you have symptoms of a fluid imbalance, diabetes insipidus, or certain types of poisoning.
Symptoms of a fluid imbalance and diabetes insipidus are similar and may include:

Excessive thirst (if dehydrated)
Nausea and vomiting
Headache
Confusion

ova and parasite test,"What is an ova and parasite test?An ova and parasite test looks for parasites and their eggs (ova) in a sample of your stool. A parasite is a tiny plant or animal that gets nutrients by living off another creature. Parasites can live in your digestive system and cause illness. These are known as intestinal parasites. Intestinal parasites affect tens of millions of people around the world. They are more common in countries where sanitation is poor, but millions of people in the United States get infected every year.The most common types of parasites in the U.S. include giardia and cryptosporidium, often referred to as crypto. These parasites are commonly found in:Rivers, lakes, and streams, even in those that appear cleanSwimming pools and hot tubsSurfaces such as bathroom handles and faucets, diaper changing tables, and toys. These surfaces may contain traces of stool from an infected person.FoodSoilMany people get infected with an intestinal parasite when they accidentally swallow contaminated water or take a drink from a lake or stream. Children at day care centers are also at higher risk for infection. Children may pick up the parasite by touching an infected surface and putting their fingers in their mouths.Fortunately, most parasite infections go away on their own or are easily treated. But a parasite infection can cause serious complications in people with weakened immune systems. Your immune system may be weakened by HIV/AIDS, cancer, or other disorders. Infants and older adults also have weaker immune systems.Other names: parasitic examination (stool), stool sample exam, stool O&P, fecal smear

pap smear,"What is a Pap smear?A Pap smear is a test for women that can help find or prevent cervical cancer. During the procedure, cells are collected from the cervix, which is the lower, narrow end of the uterus that opens into the vagina. The cells are checked for cancer or for signs that they may become cancer. These are called precancerous cells. Finding and treating precancerous cells can help prevent cervical cancer. The Pap smear is a reliable way to find cancer early, when it's most treatable.Other names for a Pap smear: Pap test, cervical cytology, Papanicolaou test, Pap smear test, vaginal smear technique
","What is it used for?A Pap smear is a way to detect abnormal cervical cells before they become cancer. Sometimes the cells collected from a Pap smear are also checked for HPV, a virus that can cause cell changes that may lead to cancer. Pap smears, along with HPV testing, are considered cervical cancer screening tests. Cervical cancer screening has been shown to greatly reduce the number of new cervical cancer cases and deaths from the disease.
","Why do I need a Pap smear?Most women between the ages of 21 and 65 should have regular Pap smears.Women between the ages of 21 and 29 should be tested every three years.Women ages 30–65 can be tested every five years if the test is combined with an HPV test. If there is no HPV test, the Pap should be done every three years.Screening is not recommended for women or girls under the age of 21. In this age group, the risk of cervical cancer is very low. Also, any changes in cervical cells are likely to go away on their own.Screening may be recommended if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk if you:Had an abnormal Pap smear in the pastHave HIVHave a weakened immune systemWere exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before birth. Between the years 1940–1971, DES was prescribed to pregnant women as a way to prevent miscarriages. It was later linked to an increased risk of certain cancers in the female children exposed to it during the pregnancy.Women older than 65 who have had normal Pap smears for several years or have had surgery to remove the uterus and cervix may not need to have Pap smears anymore. If you are unsure whether you need a Pap smear, talk to your health care provider.
","What happens during a Pap smear?A Pap smear is often taken during a pelvic exam. During a pelvic exam, you will lie on an exam table while your health care provider examines your vulva, vagina, cervix, rectum, and pelvis to check for any abnormalities. For the Pap smear, your provider will use a plastic or metal instrument called a speculum to open the vagina, so the cervix can be seen. Your provider will then use a soft brush or plastic spatula to collect cells from the cervix.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You should not have a Pap smear while you are having your period. A good time to have the test is about five days after the last day of your period. Additional recommendations are to avoid certain activities a few days before your Pap smear. Two to three days before your test you shouldn't:Use tamponsUse birth control foams or other vaginal creamsDoucheHave sex
","Are there any risks to the test?You may feel some mild discomfort during the procedure, but there are no known risks to a Pap smear.
","What do the results mean?Your Pap smear results will show whether your cervical cells are normal or abnormal. You may also get a result that is unclear.Normal Pap smear. The cells in your cervix were normal. Your health care provider will recommend that you come back for another screening in three to five years depending on your age and medical history.Unclear or unsatisfactory results. There may not have been enough cells in your sample or there may have been some other problem that made it hard for the lab to get an accurate reading. Your health care provider may ask you to come in for another test.Abnormal Pap smear. Abnormal changes were found in your cervical cells. Most women who have abnormal results do not have cervical cancer. But, your health care provider may recommend follow-up testing to monitor your cells. Many cells will go back to normal on their own. Other cells may turn into cancer cells if not treated. Finding and treating these cells early can help prevent cancer from developing.Talk to your health care provider to learn what your Pap smear results mean.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a Pap smear?Thousands of women in the U.S. die from cervical cancer every year. A Pap smear, along with the HPV test, is one of the most effective ways to prevent cancer from developing.

parathyroid hormone (pth) test,"What is a parathyroid hormone (PTH) test?This test measures the level of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the blood. PTH, also known as parathormone, is made by your parathyroid glands. These are four pea-sized glands in your neck. PTH controls the level of calcium in the blood. Calcium is a mineral that keeps your bones and teeth healthy and strong. It's also essential for the proper functioning of your nerves, muscles, and heart.If calcium blood levels are too low, your parathyroid glands will release PTH into the blood. This causes calcium levels to rise. If calcium blood levels are too high, these glands will stop making PTH.PTH levels that are too high or too low can cause serious health problems.Other names: parathormone, intact PTH
","What is it used for?A PTH test is most often used along with calcium testing to:Diagnose hyperparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormoneDiagnose hypoparathyroidism, a condition in which your parathyroid glands produce too little parathyroid hormoneFind out whether abnormal calcium levels are being caused by a problem with your parathyroid glandsMonitor kidney disease
","Why do I need a PTH test?You may need a PTH test if your results were not normal on a previous calcium test. You may also need this test if you have symptoms of having too much or too little calcium in your blood.Symptoms of too much calcium include:Bones that break easilyMore frequent urinationIncreased thirstNausea and vomitingFatigueKidney stonesSymptoms of too little calcium include:Tingling in your fingers and/or toesMuscle crampsIrregular heartbeat
","What happens during a PTH test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You probably won't need any special preparations for a PTH test, but check with your health care provider. Some providers may ask you to fast (not eat or drink) before your test, or may want you to take the test at a certain time of day.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your test shows you have a higher than normal level of PTH, it may mean you have:HyperparathyroidismA benign (noncancerous) tumor of the parathyroid glandKidney diseaseA vitamin D deficiencyA disorder that makes you unable to absorb calcium from foodIf your test shows you have a lower than normal level of PTH, it may mean you have:HypoparathyroidismAn overdose of vitamin D or calciumIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PTH test?PTH also plays an important role in controlling the levels of phosphorus and vitamin D in the blood. If your PTH test results were not normal, your provider may order phosphorus and/or vitamin D tests to help make a diagnosis.
"
partial thromboplastin time (ptt) test,"What is a PTT (partial thromboplastin time) test?A partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test measures the time it takes for a blood clot to form. Normally, when you get a cut or injury that causes bleeding, proteins in your blood called coagulation factors work together to form a blood clot. The clot stops you from losing too much blood.You have several coagulation factors in your blood. If any factors are missing or defective, it can take longer than normal for blood to clot. In some cases, this causes heavy, uncontrolled bleeding. A PTT test checks the function of specific coagulation factors. These include factors known as factor VIII, factor IX, factor X1, and factor XII.Other names: activated partial thromboplastin time, aPTT, intrinsic pathway coagulation factor profile
","What is it used for?A PTT test is used to:Check the function of specific coagulation factors. If any of these factors are missing or defective, it can mean you have a bleeding disorder. Bleeding disorders are a group of rare conditions in which blood doesn't clot normally. The most well-known bleeding disorder is hemophilia.Find out if there is another reason for excessive bleeding or other clotting problems. These include certain autoimmune diseases that cause the immune system to attack coagulation factors.Monitor people taking heparin, a type of medicine that prevents clotting. In some bleeding disorders, the blood clots too much, rather than too little. This can cause heart attacks, strokes, and other life-threatening conditions. But taking too much heparin can cause excessive and dangerous bleeding.
","Why do I need a PTT test?You may need a PTT test if you:Have unexplained heavy bleedingBruise easilyHave a blood clot in a vein or arteryHave liver disease, which can sometimes cause problems with blood clottingWill be getting surgery. Surgery can cause blood loss, so it's important to know if you have a clotting problem.Have had multiple miscarriagesAre taking heparin
","What happens during a PTT test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a PTT test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Your PTT test results will show how much time it took for your blood to clot. Results are usually given as a number of seconds. If your results show that your blood took a longer-than-normal time to clot, it may mean you have:A bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Von Willebrand disease is the most common bleeding disorder, but it usually causes milder symptoms than other bleeding disorders.Liver diseaseAntiphospholipid antibody syndrome or lupus anticoagulant syndrome. These are autoimmune diseases that cause your immune system to attack your coagulation factors.Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K plays an important role in forming coagulation factors.If you are taking heparin, your results can help show whether you are taking the right dose. You will probably be tested on a regular basis to make sure your dosage stays at the right level.If you are diagnosed with a bleeding disorder, talk to your health care provider. While there is no cure for most bleeding disorders, there are treatments available that can help manage your condition.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PTT test?A PTT test is often ordered along with another blood test called prothrombin time. A prothrombin time test is another way to measure clotting ability.
"
pdl1 (immunotherapy) tests,"What is a PDL1 test?This test measures the amount of PDL1 on cancer cells. PDL1 is a protein that helps keep immune cells from attacking nonharmful cells in the body. Normally, the immune system fights foreign substances like viruses and bacteria, and not your own healthy cells. Some cancer cells have high amounts of PDL1. This allows the cancer cells to ""trick"" the immune system, and avoid being attacked as foreign, harmful substances.If your cancer cells have a high amount of PDL1, you may benefit from a treatment called immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a therapy that boosts your immune system to help it recognize and fight cancer cells. Immunotherapy has been shown to be very effective in treating certain types of cancers. It also tends to have fewer side effects than other cancer therapies.Other names: programmed death-ligand 1, PD-LI, PDL-1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
","What is it used for?PDL1 testing is used to find out if you have a cancer that may benefit from immunotherapy.
","Why do I need a PDL1 test?You may need PDL1 testing if you've been diagnosed with one of the following cancers:Non-small cell lung cancerMelanomaHodgkin lymphomaBladder cancerKidney cancerBreast cancerHigh levels of PDL1 are often found in these, as well as some other types of cancer. Cancers that have high levels of PDL1 can often be treated effectively with immunotherapy.
","What happens during a PDL1 test?Most PDL1 tests are done in a procedure called a biopsy. There are three main types of biopsy procedures:Fine needle aspiration biopsy, which uses a very thin needle to remove a sample of cells or fluidCore needle biopsy, which uses a larger needle to remove a sampleSurgical biopsy, which removes a sample in a minor, outpatient procedureFine needle aspiration and core needle biopsies usually include the following steps:You will lay on your side or sit on an exam table.A health care provider will clean the biopsy site and inject it with an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.Once the area is numb, the provider will insert either a fine aspiration needle or core biopsy needle into the biopsy site and remove a sample of tissue or fluid.You may feel a little pressure when the sample is withdrawn.Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site until the bleeding stops.Your provider will apply a sterile bandage at the biopsy site.In a surgical biopsy, a surgeon will make a small cut in your skin to remove all or part of a breast lump. A surgical biopsy is sometimes done if the lump can't be reached with a needle biopsy. Surgical biopsies usually include the following steps.You will lie on an operating table. An IV (intravenous line) may be placed in your arm or hand.You may be given medicine, called a sedative, to help you relax.You will be given local or general anesthesia so you won't feel pain during the procedure.For local anesthesia, a health care provider will inject the biopsy site with medicine to numb the area.For general anesthesia, a specialist called an anesthesiologist will give you medicine so you will be unconscious during the procedure.Once the biopsy area is numb or you are unconscious, the surgeon will make a small cut into the breast and remove part or all of a lump. Some tissue around the lump may also be removed.The cut in your skin will be closed with stitches or adhesive strips.There are different types of biopsies. The type of biopsy you get will depend on the location and size of your tumor.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You won't need any special preparations if you are getting local anesthesia (numbing of the biopsy site). If you are getting general anesthesia, you will probably need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before surgery. Your surgeon will give you more specific instructions. Also, if you are getting a sedative or general anesthesia, be sure to arrange for someone to drive you home. You may be groggy and confused after you wake up from the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?You may have a little bruising or bleeding at the biopsy site. Sometimes the site gets infected. If that happens, you will be treated with antibiotics. A surgical biopsy may cause some additional pain and discomfort. Your health care provider may recommend or prescribe medicine to help you feel better.
","What do the results mean?If your results show your tumor cells have high levels of PDL1, you may be started on immunotherapy. If your results do not show high levels of PDL1, immunotherapy may not be effective for you. But you may benefit from another type of cancer treatment. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PDL1 test?Immunotherapy does not work for everyone, even if you have tumors with high levels of PDL1. Cancer cells are complex and often unpredictable. Health care providers and researchers are still learning about immunotherapy and how to predict who will benefit the most from this treatment.

pharmacogenetic tests,"What is pharmacogenetic testing?
Pharmacogenetics, also called pharmacogenomics, is the study of how genes affect the body's response to certain medicines. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Your genes can also affect how safe and effective a particular drug could be for you.
Genes can be the reason the same medicine at the same dose will affect people in very different ways. Genes may also be the reason some people have bad side effects to a medicine, while others have none.
Pharmacogenetic testing looks at specific genes to help figure out the types of medicines and dosages that may be right for you.
Other names: pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenomic testing

","What is it used for?
Pharmacogenetic testing may be used to:

Find out whether a certain medicine could be effective for you
Find out what the best dosage might be for you
Predict whether you will have a serious side effect from a medicine


","Why do I need pharmacogenetic testing?
Your health care provider may order these tests before you start a certain medicine, or if you are taking a medicine that is not working and/or causing bad side effects.
Pharmacogenetic tests are only available for a limited number of medicines. Below are some of the medicines and genes that can be tested. (Gene names are usually given in letters and numbers.)

"
phenylketonuria (pku) screening,"What is a PKU screening test?A PKU screening test is a blood test given to newborns 24–72 hours after birth. PKU stands for phenylketonuria, a rare disorder that prevents the body from properly breaking down a substance called phenylalanine (Phe). Phe is part of proteins that are found in many foods and in an artificial sweetener called aspartame.If you have PKU and eat these foods, Phe will build up in the blood. High levels of Phe can permanently damage the nervous system and brain, causing a variety of health problems. These include seizures, psychiatric problems, and severe intellectual disability.PKU is caused by a genetic mutation, a change in the normal function of a gene. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father. For a child to get the disorder, both the mother and father must pass down a mutated PKU gene.Although PKU is rare, all newborns in the United States are required to get a PKU test.The test is easy, with virtually no health risk. But it can save a baby from lifelong brain damage and/or other serious health problems.If PKU is found early, following a special, low-protein/low-Phe diet can prevent complications.There are specially-made formulas for infants with PKU.People with PKU need to stay on the protein/low-Phe diet for the rest of their lives.Other names: PKU newborn screening, PKU test
","What is it used for?A PKU test is used to see if a newborn has high levels of Phe in the blood. This may mean the baby has PKU, and more tests will be ordered to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
",,"What happens during a PKU screening test?A health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.The test should be done no sooner than 24 hours after birth, to ensure the baby has taken in some protein, either from breast milk or formula. This will help ensure the results are accurate. But the test should be done between 24–72 hours after birth to prevent possible PKU complications. If your baby wasn't born in the hospital or if you left the hospital early, be sure to talk to your child's health care provider to schedule a PKU test as soon as possible.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare my baby for the test?There are no special preparations needed for a PKU test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to your baby with a needle stick test. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your baby's results were not normal, your health care provider will order more tests to confirm or rule out PKU. These tests may include more blood tests and/or urine tests. You and your baby may also get genetic tests, since PKU is an inherited condition.If the results were normal, but the test was done sooner than 24 hours after birth, your baby may need to be tested again at 1 to 2 weeks of age.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PKU screening test?If your baby was diagnosed with PKU, he or she can drink formula that does not contain Phe. If you would like to breastfeed, talk your health care provider. Breast milk does contain Phe, but your baby may be able to have a limited amount, supplemented by the Phe-free formula. Regardless, your child will need to stay on a special low-protein diet for life. A PKU diet usually means avoiding high-protein foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, nuts, and beans. Instead, the diet will probably include cereals, starches, fruits, a milk substitute, and other items with low or no Phe.Your child's health care provider may recommend one or more specialists and other resources to help you manage your baby's diet and keep your child healthy. There are also a variety of resources available to teens and adults with PKU. If you have PKU, talk to your health care provider about the best ways to take care of your dietary and health needs.

phosphate in blood,"What is a phosphate in blood test?A phosphate in blood test measures the amount of phosphate in your blood. Phosphate is an electrically charged particle that contains the mineral phosphorus. Phosphorus works together with the mineral calcium to build strong bones and teeth.Normally, the kidneys filter and remove excess phosphate from the blood. If phosphate levels in your blood are too high or too low, it can be a sign of kidney disease or other serious disorder.Other names: phosphorus test, P, PO4, phosphorus-serum
","What is it used for?A phosphate in blood test may be used to:Diagnose and monitor kidney disease and bone disordersDiagnose parathyroid disorders. Parathyroid glands are small glands located in the neck. They make hormones that control the amount of calcium in the blood. If the gland makes too much or too little of these hormones, it can cause serious health problems.A phosphate in blood test is sometimes ordered along with tests of calcium and other minerals.
","Why do I need a phosphate in blood test?You may need this test if you have symptoms of kidney disease or a parathyroid disorder. These include:FatigueMuscle crampsBone painBut many people with these disorders don't have symptoms. So your provider may order a phosphate test if he or she thinks you may have kidney disease based on your health history and the results of calcium tests. Calcium and phosphate work together, so problems with calcium levels can mean problems with phosphate levels as well. Calcium testing is often part of a routine checkup.
","What happens during a phosphate in blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.

platelet tests,"What are platelet tests?
Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small blood cells that are essential for blood clotting. Clotting is the process that helps you stop bleeding after an injury. There are two types of platelet tests: a platelet count test and platelet function tests.
A platelet count test measures the number of platelets in your blood. A lower than normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. This condition can cause you to bleed too much after a cut or other injury that causes bleeding. A higher than normal platelet count is called thrombocytosis. This can make your blood clot more than you need it to. Blood clots can be dangerous because they can block blood flow.
Platelet function tests check your platelets' ability to form clots. Platelet function tests include:

Closure time. This test measures the time it takes for platelets in a blood sample to plug a small hole in a tiny tube. It helps screen for different platelet disorders.
Viscoelastometry. This test measures the strength of a blood clot as it forms. A blood clot has to be strong to stop bleeding.
Platelet aggregometry. This is a group of tests that are used to measure how well platelets clump together (aggregate).
Lumiaggregometry. This test measures the amount of light produced when certain substances are added to a blood sample. It can help show if there are defects in the platelets.
Flow cytometry. This is a test that uses lasers to look for proteins on the surface of platelets. It can help diagnose inherited platelet disorders. This is a specialized test. It is only available at certain hospitals and laboratories.
Bleeding time. This test measures the amount of time for bleeding to stop after small cuts are made in the forearm. It was once commonly used to screen for a variety of platelet disorders. Now, other platelet function tests are used more often. The newer tests provide more reliable results.

Other names: platelet count, thrombocyte count, platelet function tests, platelet function assay, platelet aggregation studies
","What are they used for?
A platelet count is most often used to monitor or diagnose conditions that cause too much bleeding or too much clotting. A platelet count may be included in a complete blood count, a test that is often done as part of a regular checkup.
Platelet function tests may be used to:

Help diagnose certain platelet diseases
Check platelet function during complex surgical procedures, such as cardiac bypass and trauma surgery. These types of procedures have an increased risk of bleeding.
Check patients before surgery, if they have a personal or family history of bleeding disorders
Monitor people who are taking blood thinners. These medicines may be given to reduce clotting in people at risk for heart attack or stroke.

","Why do I need a platelet test?
You may need platelet count and/or platelet function testing if you have symptoms of having too few or too many platelets.
Symptoms of too few platelets include:

Prolonged bleeding after a minor cut or injury
Nosebleeds
Unexplained bruising
Pinpoint sized red spots on the skin, known as petechiae
Purplish spots on the skin, known as purpura. These may be caused by bleeding under the skin.
Heavy and/or prolonged menstrual periods

Symptoms of too many platelets include:

Numbness of hands and feet
Headache
Dizziness
Weakness

You may also need platelet function testing if you are:

Undergoing a complex surgery
Taking medicines to reduce clotting

","What happens during a platelet test?
Most platelet tests are done on a blood sample.
During the test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a platelet count test
If you are getting a platelet function test, you may need to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show a lower than normal platelet count (thrombocytopenia), it may indicate:

A cancer that affects the blood, such as leukemia or lymphoma
A viral infection, such as mononucleosis, hepatitis, or measles
An autoimmune disease. This is a disorder that causes the body to attack its own healthy tissues, which can include platelets.
Infection or damage to the bone marrow
Cirrhosis
Vitamin B12 deficiency
Gestational thrombocytopenia, a common, but mild, low-platelet condition affecting pregnant women. It is not known to cause any harm to a mother or her unborn baby. It usually gets better on its own during pregnancy or after birth.

If your results show a higher than normal platelet count (thrombocytosis), it may indicate:

Certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer or breast cancer
Anemia
Inflammatory bowel disease
Rheumatoid arthritis
A viral or bacterial infection

If your platelet function test results were not normal, it may mean you have an inherited or acquired platelet disorder.  Inherited disorders are passed down from your family. The conditions are present at birth, but you may not have symptoms until you are older. Acquired disorders are not present at birth. They may be caused by other diseases, medicines, or exposure in the environment. Sometimes the cause is unknown.
Inherited platelet disorders include:

Von Willebrand disease, a genetic disorder that reduces the production of platelets or causes the platelets to work less effectively. It can cause excess bleeding.
Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together
Bernard-Soulier syndrome, another disorder that affects platelets' ability to clump together
Storage pool disease, a condition that affects platelets' ability to release substances that help platelets clump together

Acquired platelet disorders may be due to chronic diseases such as:

Kidney failure
Certain types of leukemia
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a disease of the bone marrow

","Is there anything else I need to know about platelet function tests?
Platelet tests are sometimes done along with one or more of the following blood tests:

MPV blood test, which measures the size of your platelets
Partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test, which measures the time it takes for blood to clot
Prothrombin time and INR test, which checks the body's ability to form blood clots

pleural fluid analysis,"What is a pleural fluid analysis?Pleural fluid is a liquid that is located between the layers of the pleura. The pleura is a two-layer membrane that covers the lungs and lines the chest cavity. The area that contains pleural fluid is known as the pleural space. Normally, there is a small amount of pleural fluid in the pleural space. The fluid keeps the pleura moist and reduces friction between the membranes when you breathe.Sometimes too much fluid builds up in the pleural space. This is known as pleural effusion. Pleural effusion prevents the lungs from fully inflating, making it hard to breathe. A pleural fluid analysis is a group of tests that look for the cause of pleural effusion.Other names: pleural fluid aspiration
","What is it used for?A pleural fluid analysis is used to find the cause of pleural effusion. There are two main types of pleural effusion:Transudate, which happens when there is an imbalance of pressure in certain blood vessels. This causes extra fluid to leak into the pleural space. Transudate pleural effusion is most often caused by heart failure or cirrhosis.Exudate, which happens when there is an injury or inflammation of the pleura. This can make excess fluid leak out of certain blood vessels. Exudate pleural effusion has many causes. These include infections such as pneumonia, cancer, kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases. It commonly affects only one side of the chest.To help figure out which type of pleural effusion you have, your health care provider may use a method known as Light's criteria. Light's criteria is a calculation that compares some of the findings of your pleural fluid analysis with the results of one or more protein blood tests.It's important to find out which type of pleural effusion you have, so you can get the right treatment.
","Why do I need a pleural fluid analysis?You may need this test if you have symptoms of pleural effusion. These include:Chest painDry, nonproductive cough (a cough that doesn't bring up mucus)Trouble breathingFatigueSome people with pleural effusion don't have symptoms right away. But your provider may order this test if you've had a chest x-ray for another reason, and it shows signs of pleural effusion.
","What happens during a pleural fluid analysis?Your health care provider will need to remove some pleural fluid from your pleural space. This is done through a procedure called thoracentesis. The procedure may be done in a doctor's office or hospital. During the procedure:You will need to take off most of your clothes and then put on a paper or cloth gown to cover yourself.You will sit on a hospital bed or chair, with your arms resting on a padded table. This puts your body in the right position for the procedure.Your provider will clean an area on your back with an antiseptic solution.Your provider will inject a numbing medicine into your skin, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure.Once the area is completely numb, your provider will insert a needle in your back between the ribs. The needle will go into the pleural space. Your provider may use ultrasound imaging to help find the best spot to insert the needle.You may feel some pressure as the needle goes in.Your provider will withdraw fluid into the needle.You may be asked to hold your breath or breathe out deeply at certain times during the procedure.When enough fluid has been removed, the needle will be taken out and the procedure area will be bandaged.Blood tests for certain proteins are used to calculate Light's criteria. So you may also get a blood test.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a thoracentesis or a blood test. But your provider may order a chest x-ray before the procedure.
","Are there any risks to the test?Thoracentesis is a generally safe procedure. Risks are usually minor and may include pain and bleeding at the procedure site.Serious complications are uncommon, and may include a collapsed lung or pulmonary edema, a condition in which too much pleural fluid is removed. Your provider may order a chest x-ray after the procedure to check for complications.
","What do the results mean?Your results can show whether you have a transudate or exudate type of pleural effusion. Transudate pleural effusions are most often caused by heart failure or cirrhosis. Exudate effusions may be caused by a number of different diseases and conditions. Once the type of pleural effusion has been determined, your provider will likely order more tests to make a specific diagnosis.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a pleural fluid analysis?Your pleural fluid results may be compared with other tests, including tests for glucose and for albumin, a protein made by the liver. The comparisons may be used as part of Light's criteria to help figure out what kind of pleural effusion you have.
"
porphyrin tests,"What are porphyrin tests?
Porphyrin tests measure the level of porphyrins in your blood, urine, or stool. Porphyrins are chemicals that help make hemoglobin, a type of protein in your red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.
It's normal to have a small amount of porphyrins in your blood and other body fluids. But too much porphyrin may mean you have a type of porphyria. Porphyria is a rare disorder that can cause serious health problems. Porphyria is usually divided into two categories:

Acute porphyrias, which mainly affect the nervous system and causes abdominal symptoms
Cutaneous porphyrias, which cause skin symptoms when you are exposed to sunlight

Some porphyrias affect both the nervous system and the skin.
Other names: protoporphyrin; protoporphyrin, blood; protoporhyrin, stool; porphyrins, feces; uroporphyrin; porphyrins, urine; Mauzerall-Granick test; acid; ALA; porphobilinogen; PBG; free erythrocyte protoporphyrin; fractionated erythrocyte porphyrins; FEP

","What are they used for?
Porphyrin tests are used to diagnose or monitor porphyria.

","Why do I need a porphyrin test?
You may need a porphyrin test if you have symptoms of porphyria. There are different symptoms for the different types of porphyria.
Symptoms of acute porphyria include:

Abdominal pain
Constipation
Nausea and vomiting
Red or brown urine
Tingling or pain in the hands and/or feet
Muscle weakness
Confusion
Hallucinations

Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria include:

Oversensitivity to sunlight
Blisters on skin exposed to sunlight
Redness and swelling on exposed skin
Itching
Changes in skin color

You may also need a porphyrin test if someone in your family has porphyria. Most types of porphyria are inherited, meaning the condition is passed from parent to child.
","What happens during porphyrin testing?
Porphyrins can be tested in blood, urine, or stool. The most common types of porphyrin tests are listed below.

Blood Test

A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.


24-Hour Urine Sample

You will collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. For this test, your health care provider or laboratory will give you a container and specific instructions on how to collect your samples at home. Be sure to follow all instructions carefully. This 24-hour urine sample test is used because the amounts of substances in urine, including porphyrin, can vary throughout the day. So collecting several samples in a day may give a more accurate picture of your urine content.


Random Urine Test

You can provide your sample at any time of day, with no special preparations or handling needed. This test is often done in a health care provider's office or a lab.


Stool Test (also called protoporphyrin in stool)

You will collect a sample of your stool and place it in a special container. Your health care provider will give you instructions on how to prepare your sample and send it to a lab.




","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for blood or urine tests.
For a stool test, you may be instructed to not eat meat or take any aspirin-containing medicines for three days prior to your test.

","Are there any risks to porphyrin tests?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
There are no known risks to urine or stool tests.

","What do the results mean?
If high levels of porphyrin are found in your blood, urine, or stool, your health care provider will probably order more tests to confirm a diagnosis and to find out what kind of porphyria you have. While there is no cure for porphyria, the condition can be managed. Certain lifestyle changes and/or medicines can help prevent the symptoms and complications of the disease. Specific treatment depends on the type of porphyria you have. If you have questions about your results or about porphyria, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about porphyrin tests?
While most types of porphyria are inherited, other types porphyria can also be acquired. Acquired porphyria can be caused by a variety of factors, including overexposure to lead, HIV, hepatitis C, excess iron intake, and/or heavy alcohol use.

pregnancy test,"What is a pregnancy test?A pregnancy test can tell whether you are pregnant by checking for a particular hormone in your urine or blood. The hormone is called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is made in a woman's placenta after a fertilized egg implants in the uterus. It is normally made only during pregnancy.A urine pregnancy test can find the HCG hormone about a week after you've missed a period. The test can be done in a health care provider's office or with a home test kit. These tests are basically the same, so many women choose to use a home pregnancy test before calling a provider. When used correctly, home pregnancy tests are 97–99 percent accurate.A pregnancy blood test is done in a health care provider's office. It can find smaller amounts of HCG, and can confirm or rule out a pregnancy earlier than a urine test. A blood test can detect pregnancy even before you've missed a period. Pregnancy blood tests are about 99 percent accurate. A blood test is often used to confirm the results of a home pregnancy test.Other names: human chorionic gonadotropin test, HCG test
","What is it used for?A pregnancy test is used to find out whether you are pregnant.
","Why do I need a pregnancy test?You may need this test if you think you are pregnant. Symptoms of pregnancy vary from woman to woman, but the most common sign of early pregnancy is a missed period. Other common signs of pregnancy include:Swollen, tender breastsFatigueFrequent urinationNausea and vomiting (also called morning sickness)Bloated feeling in the abdomen
","What happens during a pregnancy test?You can get a home pregnancy test kit at the drug store without a prescription. Most are inexpensive and easy to use.Many home pregnancy tests include a device called a dipstick. Some also include a collection cup. Your home test may include the following steps or similar steps:Do the test on your first urination of the morning. The test may be more accurate at this time, because morning urine usually has more HCG.Hold the dipstick in your urine stream for 5 to 10 seconds. For kits that include a collection cup, urinate into the cup, and insert the dipstick into the cup for 5 to 10 seconds.After a few minutes, the dipstick will show your results. The time to results and the way the results are shown will vary between test kit brands.Your dipstick may have a window or other area that shows a plus or minus sign, a single or double line, or the words ""pregnant"" or ""not pregnant."" Your pregnancy test kit will include instructions on how to read your results.If the results show you are not pregnant, you may want to try again in a few days, as you may have done the test too early.

prenatal cell-free dna screening,"What is a prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening?
Prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is a blood test for pregnant women. During pregnancy, some of an unborn baby's DNA circulates in the mother's bloodstream. A cfDNA screening checks this DNA to find out if the baby is more likely to have Down syndrome or another disorder caused by a trisomy.
A trisomy is a disorder of the chromosomes. Chromosomes are the parts of your cells that contain your genes. Genes are parts of DNA passed down from your mother and father. They carry information that determines your unique traits, such as height and eye color.

People normally have 46 chromosomes, divided into 23 pairs, in each cell.
If one of these pairs has an extra copy of a chromosome, it's called a trisomy. A trisomy causes changes in the way the body and brain develop.
In Down syndrome, there is an extra copy of chromosome 21. This is also known as trisomy 21. Down syndrome is the most common chromosome disorder in the United States.
Other trisomy disorders include Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), where there is an extra copy of chromosome 18, and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), where there is an extra copy of chromosome 13. These disorders are rare but more serious than Down syndrome. Most babies with trisomy 18 or trisomy 13 die within the first year of life.

A cfDNA screening has very little risk to you and your baby, but it can't tell you for sure whether your baby has a chromosome disorder. Your health care provider will need to order other tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
Other names: cell-free fetal DNA, cffDNA, non-invasive prenatal test, NIPT
","What is used for?
A cfDNA screening is most often used to show if your unborn baby has an increased risk for one of the following chromosome disorders:

Down syndrome (trisomy 21)
Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)
Patau syndrome (trisomy 13)

The screening may also be used to:

Determine a baby's gender (sex). This may be done if an ultrasound shows that a baby's genitals are not clearly male or female. This may be caused by a disorder of the sex chromosomes.
Check Rh blood type. Rh is a protein found on red blood cells. If you have the protein, you are considered Rh positive. If you don't, you are Rh negative. If you are Rh negative and your unborn baby is Rh positive, your body's immune system may attack your baby's blood cells. If you find out you are Rh negative early in pregnancy, you can take medicines to protect your baby from dangerous complications.

A cfDNA screening can be done as early as the 10th week of pregnancy.
","Why do I need a prenatal cfDNA screening?
Many health care providers recommend this screening to pregnant women who are at higher
risk of having a baby with a chromosome disorder. You may be at higher risk if:

You are age 35 or older. A mother's age is the primary risk factor for having a baby with Down syndrome or other trisomy disorders. The risk increases as a woman gets older.
You've had another baby with a chromosome disorder.
Your fetal ultrasound didn't look normal.
Other prenatal test results were not normal.

Some health care providers recommend screening to all pregnant women. This is because the screening has almost no risk and has a high rate of accuracy compared with other prenatal screening tests.
You and your health care provider should discuss if a cfDNA screening is right for you.
","What happens during a prenatal cfDNA screening?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for this test?
You may want to speak to a genetic counselor before you get tested. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing.  He or she can explain the possible results and what they might mean to you and your baby.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no risk to your unborn baby and very little risk to you. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results were negative, it's unlikely that your baby has Down syndrome or another trisomy disorder. If your results were positive, it means there is an increased risk that your baby has one of these disorders. But it can't tell you for sure if your baby is affected. For a more confirmed diagnosis you'll need other tests, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS). These tests are usually very safe procedures, but they do have a slight risk of causing a miscarriage.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider and/or a genetic counselor.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a prenatal cfDNA screening?
cfDNA screenings are not as accurate in women who are pregnant with more than one baby (twins, triplets, or more).

procalcitonin test,"What is a procalcitonin test?A procalcitonin test measures the level of procalcitonin in your blood. A high level could be a sign of a serious bacterial infection, such as sepsis. Sepsis is the body's severe response to infection. Sepsis happens when an infection in one area of your body, such as your skin or urinary tract, spreads into your bloodstream. This triggers an extreme immune reaction. It can cause a rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, decreased blood pressure, and other symptoms. Without quick treatment, sepsis can lead to organ failure or even death.A procalcitonin test can help your health care provider determine if you have sepsis or another serious bacterial infection in the early stages. This may help you get treated promptly and avoid life-threatening complications.Other names: PCT test

"
progesterone test,"What is a progesterone test?
A progesterone test measures the level of progesterone in the blood. Progesterone is a hormone made by a woman's ovaries. Progesterone plays an important role in pregnancy. It helps make your uterus ready to support a fertilized egg. Progesterone also helps prepare your breasts for making milk.
Progesterone levels vary during a woman's menstrual cycle. The levels start out low, then increase after the ovaries release an egg. If you become pregnant, progesterone levels will continue to rise as your body gets ready to support a developing baby. If you do not become pregnant (your egg is not fertilized), your progesterone levels will go down and your period will begin.
Progesterone levels in a pregnant woman are about 10 times higher than they are in a woman who is not pregnant. Men also make progesterone, but in much smaller amounts. In men, progesterone is made by the adrenal glands and testes.
Other names: serum progesterone, progesterone blood test, PGSN

","What is it used for?
A progesterone test is used to:

Find the cause of a woman's infertility (the inability to make a baby)
Find out if and when you are ovulating
Find out your risk of a miscarriage
Monitor a high-risk pregnancy
Diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy that grows in the wrong place (outside the uterus). A developing baby can't survive an ectopic pregnancy. This condition is dangerous, and sometimes life-threatening, for a woman.


","Why do I need a progesterone test?
You may need this test if you are having trouble getting pregnant. A progesterone test can help your health care provider see if you are ovulating normally.
If you are pregnant, you may need this test to check the health of your pregnancy. Your provider may recommend a progesterone test if you are at risk for miscarriage or other pregnancy complications. Your pregnancy may be at risk if you have symptoms such as abdominal cramps or bleeding, and/or a previous history of miscarriage.

","What happens during a progesterone test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?

"
prolactin levels,"What is a prolactin levels test?A prolactin (PRL) test measures the level of prolactin in the blood. Prolactin is a hormone made by the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain. Prolactin causes the breasts to grow and make milk during pregnancy and after birth. Prolactin levels are normally high for pregnant women and new mothers. Levels are normally low for nonpregnant women and for men.If prolactin levels are higher than normal, it often means there is a type of tumor of the pituitary gland, known as a prolactinoma. This tumor makes the gland produce too much prolactin. Excess prolactin can cause the production of breast milk in men and in women who are not pregnant or breastfeeding. In women, too much prolactin can also cause menstrual problems and infertility (the inability to get pregnant). In men, it can lead to lower sex drive and erectile dysfunction (ED). Also known as impotence, ED is the inability to get or maintain an erection.Prolactinomas are usually benign (noncancerous). But left untreated, these tumors can damage surrounding tissues.Other names: PRL test, prolactin blood test
","What is it used for?A prolactin levels test is most often used to:Diagnose a prolactinoma (a type of tumor of the pituitary gland)Help find the cause of a woman's menstrual irregularities and/or infertilityHelp find the cause of a man's low sex drive and/or erectile dysfunction
","Why do I need a prolactin levels test?You may need this test if you have symptoms of a prolactinoma. Symptoms may include:Production of breast milk if you are not pregnant or breastfeedingNipple dischargeHeadachesChanges in visionOther symptoms are different depending on whether you are a man or woman. If you are a woman, symptoms also depend on whether you have gone through menopause. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her menstrual periods have stopped and she can't become pregnant anymore. It usually starts when a woman is around 50 years old.Symptoms of excess prolactin in women who have not gone through menopause include:Irregular periodsPeriods that have stopped completely before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause.InfertilityBreast tendernessWomen who have gone through menopause may not have symptoms until the condition worsens. Excess prolactin after menopause often causes hypothyroidism. In this condition, the body does not make enough thyroid hormone. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include:FatigueWeight gainMuscle painConstipationTrouble tolerating cold temperaturesSymptoms of excess prolactin in men include:Nipple dischargeBreast enlargementLow sex driveErectile dysfunctionDecrease in body hair
","What happens during a prolactin levels test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You will need to take your test about three to four hours after waking up. Prolactin levels change throughout the day, but are usually the highest in early morning.Be sure to tell your health care provider about any medicines you are taking. Certain medicines can raise prolactin levels. These include birth control pills, high blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your results show higher than normal prolactin levels, it may mean you have one of the following conditions:Prolactinoma (a type of tumor of the pituitary gland)HypothyroidismA disease of the hypothalamus.

prostate-specific antigen (psa) test,"What is a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test?
A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test measures the level of PSA in your blood. The prostate is a small gland that is part of a man's reproductive system. It is located below the bladder and makes a fluid that is part of semen. PSA is a substance made by the prostate. Men normally have low PSA levels in their blood. A high PSA level may be a sign of prostate cancer, the most common non-skin cancer affecting American men. But high PSA levels can also mean noncancerous prostate conditions, such as infection or benign prostatic hyperplasia, a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate.
Other names: total PSA, free PSA

","What is it used for?
A PSA test is used to screen for prostate cancer. Screening is a test that looks for a disease, such as cancer, in its early stages, when it's most treatable. Leading health organizations, such as the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), disagree on recommendations for using the PSA test for cancer screening. Reasons for disagreement include:

Most types of prostate cancer grow very slowly. It can take decades before any symptoms show up.
Treatment of slow-growing prostate cancer is often unnecessary. Many men with the disease live long, healthy lives without ever knowing they had cancer.
Treatment can cause major side effects, including erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.
Fast-growing prostate cancer is less common, but more serious and often life-threatening. Age, family history, and other factors can put you at higher risk. But the PSA test alone can't tell the difference between slow- and fast-growing prostate cancer.

To find out if PSA testing is right for you, talk to your health care provider.

","Why do I need a PSA test?
You may get a PSA test if you have certain risk factors for prostate cancer. These include:

A father or brother with prostate cancer
Being African-American. Prostate cancer is more common in African American men. The reason for this is unknown.
Your age. Prostate cancer is more common in men over the age of 50.

You may also get a PSA test if:

You have symptoms such as painful or frequent urination, and pelvic and/or back pain.
You've already been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The PSA test can help monitor the effects of your treatment.

","What happens during a PSA test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You will need to avoid having sex or masturbating for 24 hours before your PSA test, as releasing semen can raise your PSA levels.

","Are there any risks to the test? 
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
High PSA levels can mean cancer or a noncancerous condition such as a prostate infection, which can be treated with antibiotics. If your PSA levels are higher than normal, your health care provider will probably order more tests, including:

A rectal exam. For this test, your health care provider will insert a gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate.
A biopsy. This is a minor surgical procedure, where a provider will take a small sample of prostate cells for testing.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PSA test?
Researchers are looking into ways to improve the PSA test. The goal is to have a test that does a better job of telling the difference between non-serious, slow-growing prostate cancers and cancers that are fast growing and potentially life-threatening.
"
protein c and protein s tests,"What are protein C and protein S tests?
These tests measure the levels of protein C and protein S in your blood. Protein C and protein S tests are two separate tests that are often done at the same time.
Protein C and protein S work together to prevent your blood from clotting too much. Normally, your body makes blood clots to stop bleeding after a cut or other injury. If you don't have enough protein C (protein C deficiency) or enough protein S (protein S deficiency), your blood can clot more than you need it to. If this happens, you may get a clot that partly or completely blocks blood flow in a vein or artery. These clots can form in the arms and legs and travel to your lungs. When a blood clot forms in the lungs it's called a pulmonary embolism. This condition is life-threatening.
Protein C and protein S deficiencies can be mild or severe. Some people with mild deficiencies never have a dangerous blood clot. But certain factors can increase the risk. These include surgery, pregnancy, certain infections, and extended periods of inactivity, such as being on a long airline flight.
Protein C and protein S deficiencies are sometimes inherited (passed down from your parents), or can be acquired later in life. Testing may help find ways to prevent the formation of clots, regardless of how you got the deficiency.
Other names:  protein C antigen, protein S antigen

","What are they used for?
Protein C and protein S tests are used to diagnose clotting disorders. If tests show you have a protein C or a protein S deficiency, there are medicines and lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your risk of clots.

","Why do I need protein C and protein S tests?
You may need these tests if you have certain risk factors. You may be at higher risk of a protein C or a protein S deficiency if you:

Have a family member who has been diagnosed with a clotting disorder. Protein C and protein S deficiencies can be inherited.
Had a blood clot that can't be explained
Had a blood clot in an unusual location such as the arms or the blood vessels of the brain
Had a blood clot and are under the age of 50
Had repeated miscarriages. Protein C and protein S deficiencies sometimes cause clotting problems that affect pregnancies.


","What happens during protein C and protein S testing?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Your health care provider may tell you to avoid certain medicines for several days or longer before your test. Blood thinners, medicines that prevent clots, can affect your results.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
If your results show low levels of protein C or protein S, you may be at risk of a dangerous clot. While there is no cure for protein C and protein S deficiencies, there are ways to reduce your risk of clots.
Your health care provider will make a treatment plan based on your results and health history. Your treatment may include medicines that make it harder for the blood to clot. These include blood thinning drugs called warfarin and heparin. Your provider may also recommend lifestyle changes, such as not smoking and not using birth control pills.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about protein C and protein S tests?
If you have a family history or previous history of clotting, and are pregnant, be sure to tell your health care provider. Protein C and protein S deficiencies can cause dangerous clots during pregnancy. Your provider can recommend steps to ensure you and your baby stay healthy. These may include medicines, and/or frequent tests to monitor your condition.
"
protein in urine,"What is a protein in urine test?A protein in urine test measures how much protein is in your urine. Proteins are substances that are essential for your body to function properly. Protein is normally found in the blood. If there is a problem with your kidneys, protein can leak into your urine. While a small amount is normal, a large amount of protein in urine may indicate kidney disease.Other names: urine protein, 24-hour urine protein; urine total protein; ratio; reagent strip urinalysis
","What is it used for?A protein in urine test is often part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and substances in your urine. Urinalysis is often included as part of a routine exam. This test may also be used to look for or to monitor kidney disease.
","Why do I need a protein in urine test?Your health care provider may have ordered a protein test as part of your regular checkup, or if you have symptoms of kidney disease. These symptoms include:Difficulty urinatingFrequent urination, especially at nightNausea and vomitingLoss of appetiteSwelling in the hands and feetFatigueItching
","What happens during a protein in urine test?A protein in urine test can be done in the home as well as in a lab. If in a lab, you will receive instructions to provide a ""clean catch"" sample. The clean catch method includes the following steps:Wash your hands.Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. Men should wipe the tip of their penis. Women should open their labia and clean from front to back.Start to urinate into the toilet.Move the collection container under your urine stream.Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.Finish urinating into the toilet.Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.If at home, you will use a test kit. The kit will include a package of strips for testing and instructions on how to provide a clean catch sample. Talk to your health care provider if you have any questions.Your health care provider may also request you collect all your urine during a 24-hour period. This ""24-hour urine sample test"" is used because the amounts of substances in urine, including protein, can vary throughout the day. Collecting several samples in a day may provide a more accurate picture of your urine content.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations to test for protein in urine. If your health care provider has ordered a 24-hour urine sample, you will get specific instructions on how to provide and store your samples.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is no known risk to having a urinalysis or a urine in protein test.
","What do the results mean?If a large amount of protein is found in your urine sample, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have a medical problem needing treatment. Strenuous exercise, diet, stress, pregnancy, and other factors can cause a temporary rise in urine protein levels. Your health care provider may recommend additional urinalysis tests if a high level of protein is found This testing may include a 24-hour urine sample test.If your urine protein levels are consistently high, it may indicate kidney damage or other medical condition. These include:Urinary tract infectionLupusHigh blood pressurePreeclampsia, a serious complication of pregnancy, marked by high blood pressure. If it is not treated, preeclampsia can be life-threatening to the mother and baby.DiabetesCertain types of cancerTo learn what your results mean, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a protein in urine test?If you will be doing your urine test at home, ask your health care provider for recommendations on which test kit would be best for you. At-home urine tests are easy to do and provide accurate results as long as you carefully follow all instructions.
"
prothrombin time test and inr (pt/inr),"What is a prothrombin time test with an INR (PT/INR)?
A prothrombin time (PT) test measures how long it takes for a clot to form in a blood sample. An INR (international normalized ratio) is a type of calculation based on PT test results.
Prothrombin is a protein made by the liver. It is one of several substances known as clotting (coagulation) factors. When you get a cut or other injury that causes bleeding, your clotting factors work together to form a blood clot. Clotting factor levels that are too low can cause you to bleed too much after an injury. Levels that are too high can cause dangerous clots to form in your arteries or veins.
A PT/INR test helps find out if your blood is clotting normally. It also checks to see if a medicine that prevents blood clots is working the way it should.
Other names: prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, PT protime
","What is it used for?
A PT/INR test is most often used to:

See how well warfarin is working. Warfarin is a blood-thinning medicine that's used to treat and prevent dangerous blood clots. (Coumadin is a common brand name for warfarin.)
Find out the reason for abnormal blood clots
Find out the reason for unusual bleeding
Check clotting function before surgery
Check for liver problems

A PT/INR test is often done along with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test. A PTT test also checks for clotting problems.
","Why do I need a PT/INR test?
You may need this test if you are taking warfarin on a regular basis. The test helps make sure you are taking the right dose.
If you are not taking warfarin, you may need this test if you have symptoms of a bleeding or clotting disorder.
Symptoms of a bleeding disorder include:

Unexplained heavy bleeding
Bruising easily
Unusually heavy nose bleeds
Unusually heavy menstrual periods in women

Symptoms of a clotting disorder include:

Leg pain or tenderness
Leg swelling
Redness or red streaks on the legs
Trouble breathing
Cough
Chest pain
Rapid heartbeat

In addition, you may need a PT/INR test if you are scheduled for surgery. It helps make sure your blood is clotting normally, so you won't lose too much blood during the procedure.
","What happens during a PT/INR test?
The test may be done on a blood sample from a vein or a fingertip.
For a blood sample from a vein:
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
For a blood sample from a fingertip:
A fingertip test may be done in a provider's office or in your home. If you are taking warfarin, your provider may recommend you test your blood regularly using an at-home PT/INR test kit. During this test, you or your provider will:

Use a small needle to puncture your fingertip
Collect a drop of blood and place it onto a test strip or other special instrument
Place the instrument or test strip into a device that calculates the results. At-home devices are small and lightweight.

If you are using an at-home test kit, you will need to review your results with your provider. Your provider will let you know how he or she would like to receive the results.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
If you are taking warfarin, you may need to delay your daily dose until after testing. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any other special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If you were tested because you are taking warfarin, your results will probably be in the form of INR levels. INR levels are often used because they make it easier to compare results from different labs and different test methods. If you are not taking warfarin, your results may be in the form of INR levels or the number of seconds it takes for your blood sample to clot (prothrombin time).
If you are taking warfarin:

INR levels that are too low may mean you are at risk for dangerous blood clots.
INR levels that are too high may mean you are at risk for dangerous bleeding.

Your health care provider will probably change your dose of warfarin to reduce these risks.
If you are not taking warfarin and your INR or prothrombin time results were not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions:

A bleeding disorder, a condition in which the body can't clot blood properly, causing excessive bleeding
A clotting disorder, a condition in which the body forms excessive clots in arteries or veins
Liver disease
Vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting.

Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PT/INR test?
Sometimes certain liver tests are ordered along with a PT/INR test. These include:

Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)

pten genetic test,"What is a PTEN genetic test?A PTEN genetic test looks for a change, known as a mutation, in a gene called PTEN. Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.The PTEN gene helps stop the growth of tumors. It's known as a tumor suppressor. A tumor suppressor gene is like the brakes on a car. It puts the ""brakes"" on cells, so they don't divide too quickly. If you have a PTEN genetic mutation, it can cause the growth of noncancerous tumors called hamartomas. Hamartomas can show up throughout the body. The mutation can also lead to the development of cancerous tumors.A PTEN genetic mutation can be inherited from your parents, or acquired later in life from the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division.An inherited PTEN mutation can cause a variety of health disorders. Some of these can start at infancy or early childhood. Others show up in adulthood. These disorders are often grouped together and called PTEN hamartoma syndrome (PTHS) and include:Cowden syndrome, a disorder that causes the growth of many hamartomas and increases the risk of several types of cancer, including cancers of the breast, uterus, thyroid, and colon. People with Cowden syndrome often have a larger than normal sized head (macrocephaly), developmental delays, and/or autism.Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome also causes hamartomas and macrocephaly. In addition, people with this syndrome may have learning disabilities and/or autism. Males with the disorder often have dark freckles on the penis.Proteus or Proteus-like syndrome can cause an overgrowth of bones, skin, and other tissues, as well as hamartomas and macrocephaly.Acquired (also known as somatic) PTEN genetic mutations are one of the commonly found mutations in human cancer. These mutations have been found in many different types of cancer, including prostate cancer, uterine cancer, and some types of brain tumors.Other names: PTEN gene, full gene analysis; PTEN sequencing and deletion/duplication
","What is it used for?The test is used to look for a PTEN genetic mutation. It is not a routine test. It is usually given to people based on family history, symptoms, or previous diagnosis of cancer, especially cancer of the breast, thyroid, or uterus.
","Why do I need a PTEN genetic test?You or your child may need a PTEN genetic test if you have a family history of a PTEN genetic mutation and/or one or more of the following conditions or symptoms:Multiple hamartomas, especially in the gastrointestinal areaMacrocephaly (larger than normal sized head)Developmental delaysAutismDark freckling of the penis in malesBreast cancerThyroid cancerUterine cancer in femalesIf you've been diagnosed with cancer and don't have a family history of the disease, your health care provider may order this test to see if PTEN genetic mutation may be causing your cancer. Knowing whether you have the mutation can help your provider predict how your disease will develop and guide your treatment.
","What happens during a PTEN genetic test?A PTEN test is usually a blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your results show you have a PTEN genetic mutation, it does not mean you have cancer, but your risk is higher than most people. But more frequent cancer screenings can reduce your risk. Cancer is more treatable when found in the early stages. If you have the mutation, your health care provider may recommend one or more of the following screening tests:Colonoscopy, starting at age 35–40Mammogram, starting at age 30 for womenMonthly breast self-exams for womenYearly uterine screening for womenYearly thyroid screeningYearly check of skin for growthsYearly kidney screeningYearly thyroid and skin screenings are also recommended for children with a PTEN genetic mutation.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a PTEN genetic test?If you've been diagnosed with a PTEN genetic mutation or are thinking about getting tested, it may help to speak to a genetic counselor. A genetic counselor is a specially trained professional in genetics and genetic testing. If you haven't yet been tested, the counselor can help you understand the risks and benefits of testing. If you have been tested, the counselor can help you understand the results and direct you to support services and other resources.

rash evaluation,"What is a rash evaluation?
A rash evaluation is a test to find out what is causing a rash. A rash, also known as dermatitis, is an area of skin that is red, irritated, and usually itchy. A skin rash may also be dry, scaly, and/or painful. Most rashes happen when your skin touches a substance that irritates it. This is known as contact dermatitis. There are two main types of contact dermatitis: allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis.
Allergic contact dermatitis happens when your body's immune system treats a normally harmless substance as if it were a threat. When exposed to the substance, the immune system sends out chemicals in response. These chemicals affect your skin, causing you to develop a rash. Common causes of allergic contact dermatitis include:

Poison ivy and related plants, like poison sumac and poison oak. A poison ivy rash is one of the most common types of contact dermatitis.
Cosmetics
Fragrances
Jewelry metals, such as nickel.

Allergic contact dermatitis usually causes itching that can be severe.
Irritant contact dermatitis happens when a chemical substance damages an area of skin. This causes a skin rash to form. Common causes of irritant contact dermatitis include:

Household products such as detergents and drain cleaners
Strong soaps
Pesticides
Nail polish remover
Body fluids, such as urine and saliva. These rashes, which include diaper rash, most commonly affect babies.

Irritant contact dermatitis is usually more painful than itchy.
In addition to contact dermatitis, a rash may be caused by:

Skin disorders, such as eczema and psoriasis
Infections such as chicken pox, shingles, and measles
Insect bites
Heat. If you get overheated, your sweat glands can get blocked. This can cause a heat rash. Heat rashes often happen in hot, humid weather. While it can affect people of any age, heat rashes are most common in babies and young children.

Other names: patch test, skin biopsy
","What is it used for?
A rash evaluation is used to diagnose the cause of a rash. Most rashes can be treated at home with over-the-counter anti-itch creams or antihistamines. But sometimes a rash is a sign of a more serious condition and should be checked by a health care provider.
","Why do I need a rash evaluation?
You may need a rash evaluation if you have rash symptoms that aren't responding to at-home treatment. Symptoms of a contact dermatitis rash include:

Redness
Itching
Pain (more common with an irritant rash)
Dry, cracked skin

Other types of rashes may have similar symptoms. Additional symptoms vary depending on the cause of the rash.
While most rashes are not serious, in some cases a rash can be a sign of a serious health condition. Call your health care provider if you or your child has a skin rash with any of the following symptoms:

Severe pain
Blisters, especially if they affect the skin around the eyes, mouth, or genitals
Yellow or green fluid, warmth, and/or red streaks in the rash area. These are signs of infection.
Fever. This could be a sign of a viral or bacterial infection. These include scarlet fever, shingles, and measles.

Sometimes a rash can be the first sign of a severe and dangerous allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Call 911 or seek immediate medical attention if:

The rash is sudden and spreads quickly
You have trouble breathing
Your face is swollen

","What happens during a rash evaluation?
There are different ways to do a rash evaluation. The type of test you get will depend on your symptoms and medical history.
To test for allergic contact dermatitis, your health care provider may give you a patch test:
During a patch test:

A provider will place small patches on your skin. The patches look like adhesive bandages. They contain small amounts of specific allergens (substances that cause an allergic reaction).
You'll wear the patches for 48 to 96 hours and then return to your provider's office.
Your provider will remove the patches and check for rashes or other reactions.

There is no test for irritant contact dermatitis. But your provider may make a diagnosis based on a physical exam, your symptoms, and information you provide about your exposure to certain substances.
A rash evaluation may also include a blood test and/or a skin biopsy.
During a blood test:
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
During a biopsy:
A provider will use a special tool or a blade to remove a small piece of skin for testing.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to stop taking certain medicines before the test. These include antihistamines and antidepressants. Your health care provider will let you know which medicines to avoid and how long you need to avoid them before your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a patch test. If you feel intense itching or pain under the patches once you are home, remove the patches and call your health care provider.
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
After a biopsy, you may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. If these symptoms last longer than a few days or they get worse, talk to your provider.
","What do the results mean?
If you had a patch test and have itchy, red bumps or swelling at any of the testing sites, it means you are probably allergic to the substance tested.
If you had a blood test, abnormal results may mean you:

Are allergic to a certain substance
Have a viral, bacterial, or fungal infection

If you had a skin biopsy, abnormal results may mean you:

Have a skin disorder such as psoriasis or eczema
Have a bacterial or fungal infection

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a rash evaluation?
To relieve symptoms of a skin rash, your provider may suggest over-the-counter medicines and/or at-home treatments, such as cool compresses and cool baths. Other treatments will depend on your specific diagnosis.
"
rdw (red cell distribution width),"What is a red cell distribution width test?A red cell distribution width (RDW) test is a measurement of the range in the volume and size of your red blood cells (erythrocytes). Red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are larger than normal, it could indicate a medical problem.Other names: RDW-SD (standard deviation) test, Erythrocyte Distribution Width
","What is it used for?The RDW blood test is often part of a complete blood count (CBC), a test that measures many different components of your blood, including red cells. The RDW test is commonly used to diagnose anemia, a condition in which your red blood cells can't carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The RDW test may also be used to diagnose:Other blood disorders such as thalassemia, an inherited disease that can cause severe anemiaMedical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, and cancer, especially colorectal cancer.
","Why do I need an RDW test?Your health care provider may have ordered a complete blood count, which includes an RDW test, as part of a routine exam, or if you have:Symptoms of anemia, including weakness, dizziness, pale skin, and cold hands and feetA family history of thalassemia, sickle cell anemia or other inherited blood disorderA chronic illness such as Crohn's disease, diabetes or HIV/AIDSA diet low in iron and mineralsA long-term infectionExcessive blood loss from an injury or surgical procedure
","What happens during an RDW test?A health care professional will take a sample of your blood by using a small needle to draw blood from a vein in your arm. The needle is attached to a test tube, which will store your sample. When the tube is full, the needle will be removed from your arm. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.After the needle is removed, you'll be given a bandage or a piece of gauze to press over the site for a minute or two to help stop the bleeding. You may want to keep the bandage on for a couple of hours.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a RDW test. If your health care provider has also ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?RDW results help your health care provider understand how much your red blood cells vary in size and volume. Even if your RDW results are normal, you may still have a medical condition needing treatment. That's why RDW results are usually combined with other blood measurements. This combination of results can provide a more complete picture of the health of your red blood cells and can help diagnose a variety of conditions, including:Iron deficiencyDifferent types of anemiaThalassemiaSickle cell anemiaChronic liver diseaseKidney diseaseColorectal CancerMost likely your doctor will need further tests to confirm a diagnosis.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a red cell distribution width test?If your test results indicate you have a chronic blood disorder, such as anemia, you may be put on a treatment plan to increase the amount of oxygen that your red blood cells can carry. Depending on your specific condition, your doctor may recommend iron supplements, medications, and/or changes in your diet.Be sure to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements or making any changes in your eating plan.

red blood cell antibody screen,"What is an RBC antibody screen?An RBC (red blood cell) antibody screen is a blood test that looks for antibodies that target red blood cells. Red blood cell antibodies may cause harm to you after a transfusion or, if you are pregnant, to your baby. An RBC antibody screen can find these antibodies before they cause health problems.Antibodies are proteins made by your body to attack foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria. Red blood cell antibodies may show up in your blood if you are exposed to red blood cells other than your own. This usually happens after a blood transfusion or during pregnancy, if a mother's blood comes in contact with her unborn baby's blood. Sometimes the immune system acts like these red blood cells are ""foreign"" and will attack them.Other names: antibody screen, indirect antiglobulin test, indirect anti-human globulin test, IAT, indirect coombs test, erythrocyte Ab
","What is it used for?RBC screen is used to:Check your blood before a blood transfusion. The test can show whether your blood is compatible with the donor's blood. If your blood is not compatible, your immune system will attack the transfused blood as if it is a foreign substance. This will be harmful to your health.Check your blood during pregnancy. The test can show whether a mother's blood is compatible with the blood of her unborn baby. A mother and her baby may have different types of antigens on their red blood cells. Antigens are substances that produce an immune response. Red blood cell antigens include the Kell antigen and the Rh antigen.If you have the Rh antigen, you are considered Rh positive. If you don't have the Rh antigen, you are considered Rh negative.If you are Rh negative and your unborn baby is Rh positive, your body may begin to make antibodies against your baby's blood. This condition is called Rh incompatibility.Both Kell antigens and Rh incompatibility may cause a mother to make antibodies against her baby's blood. The antibodies can destroy the baby's red blood cells, causing a severe form of anemia. But you can get a treatment that will prevent you from making antibodies that could harm your baby.Check the blood of your unborn baby's father.If you are Rh negative, your baby's father may be tested to find out his Rh type. If he is Rh positive, your baby will be at risk for Rh incompatibility. Your health care provider will probably perform more tests to find out whether or not there is incompatibility.
","Why do I need an RBC antibody screen?Your health care provider may order an RBC screen if you are scheduled to get a blood transfusion, or if you are pregnant. An RBC screen is usually done in early pregnancy, as part of routine prenatal testing.
","What happens during an RBC antibody screen?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an RBC screen.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If you are getting a blood transfusion: The RBC screen will show whether your blood is compatible with the donor's blood. If it is not compatible, another donor will need to be found.If you are pregnant: The RBC screen will show whether your blood has any antigens that could harm your baby, including whether or not you have Rh incompatibility.If you have Rh incompatibility, your body may begin to make antibodies against your baby's blood.These antibodies are not a risk in your first pregnancy, because the baby is usually born before any antibodies are made. But these antibodies could harm your unborn baby in future pregnancies.Rh incompatibility can be treated with an injection that prevents your body from making antibodies against your baby's red blood cells.If you are Rh positive, there is no risk of Rh incompatibility.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an RBC antibody screen?Rh incompatibility is not common. Most people are Rh positive, which does not cause blood incompatibility and poses no health risks.
"
respiratory pathogens panel,"What is a respiratory pathogens (RP) panel?
A respiratory pathogens (RP) panel checks for pathogens in the respiratory tract. A pathogen is a virus, bacteria, or other organism that causes an illness. Your respiratory tract is made up of parts of the body involved in breathing. This includes your lungs, nose, and throat.
There are many types of viruses and bacteria that can infect the respiratory tract. Symptoms are often similar, but treatment can be very different. So it's important to make the right diagnosis. Other viral and bacterial tests for respiratory infections are often limited to testing for one specific pathogen. Several samples may be needed. The process can be difficult and time consuming.
An RP panel only needs a single sample to run tests for a wide variety of viruses and bacteria. Results usually come in a few hours. Results from other types of respiratory tests can take a few days. Faster results may allow you to get started earlier on the right treatment.
Other names: RP panel, respiratory virus profile, syndromic multiplex panel
","What is it used for?
A respiratory pathogens panel is used to help diagnose:
Viral infections, such as:

Flu
Common cold
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This is a common and usually mild respiratory infection. But it can be dangerous to babies and the elderly.
Adenovirus infection. Adenoviruses cause many different types of infections. These include pneumonia and croup, an infection that causes hoarse, barking coughs.

Bacterial infections, such as:

Whooping cough
Bacterial pneumonia

","Why do I need a respiratory pathogens panel?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a respiratory infection and are at risk for complications. Most respiratory infections cause mild to moderate symptoms. But the infections can be serious or even life threatening to young children, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems.
Symptoms of a respiratory infection include:

Coughing
Trouble breathing
Sore throat
Stuffy or runny nose
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Fever

","What happens during a respiratory pathogens panel?
There are two ways a provider may take a sample for testing:
Nasopharyngeal swab:

You will tip your head back.
Your health care provider will insert a swab into your nostril until it reaches the upper part of your throat.
Your provider will rotate the swab and remove it.

Nasal aspirate:

Your provider will inject a saline solution into your nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a respiratory pathogens panel.
","Are there any risks to the test?
The swab test may tickle your throat or cause you to cough. The nasal aspirate may be uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.
","What do the results mean?
A negative result may mean your symptoms were caused by a pathogen not included in the panel of tests. It may also mean you have a condition not caused by a virus or bacteria.
A positive result means a specific pathogen was found. It tells you which type of infection you have. If more than one part of the panel was positive, it means you may be infected with more than one pathogen. This is known as a co-infection.
Based on your results, your provider will recommend treatment and/or order more tests. These may include a bacteria culture, viral blood tests, and a Gram stain. The tests may help confirm your diagnosis and guide treatment.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) tests,"What is an RSV test?
RSV, which stands for respiratory syncytial virus, is an infection that affects the respiratory tract. Your respiratory tract includes your lungs, nose, and throat. RSV is very contagious, which means it spreads easily from person to person. It's also very common. Most children get RSV by the age of 2. RSV usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But the virus may lead to serious breathing problems, especially in young babies, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. RSV testing checks for the virus that causes an RSV infection.
Other names: respiratory syncytial antibody test, RSV rapid detection

","What is it used for?
An RSV test is most often used to check for infections in infants, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems. The test is usually done during the ""RSV season,"" the time of year when RSV outbreaks are more common. In the United States, RSV season usually starts in mid-fall and ends in early spring.

","Why do I need an RSV test?
Adults and older children usually don't need RSV testing. Most RSV infections only cause mild symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, and headaches. But an infant, younger child, or an elderly adult may need an RSV test if he or she has serious symptoms of infection. These include:

Fever
Wheezing
Severe coughing
Breathing faster than normal, especially in infants
Trouble breathing
Skin that turns blue


","What happens during an RSV test?
There are a few different types of RSV testing:

Nasal aspirate. A health care provider will inject a saline solution into the nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction.
Swab test. A health care provider will use a special swab to take a sample from the nose or throat.
A blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in the arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. This usually takes less than five minutes.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for an RSV test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to RSV testing.

The nasal aspirate may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.
For a swab test, there may be a little gagging or discomfort when the throat or nose is swabbed.
For a blood test, there may be slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.


","What do the results mean?
A negative result means there is no RSV infection and the symptoms are likely caused by another type of virus. A positive result means there is an RSV infection. Infants, young children, and elderly adults with serious RSV symptoms may have to be treated in the hospital. Treatment may include oxygen and intravenous fluids (fluids delivered directly to the veins). In rare cases, a breathing machine called a ventilator may be needed.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an RSV test?
If you have RSV symptoms, but are otherwise in good health, your health care provider probably won't order RSV testing. Most healthy adults and children with RSV will get better in 1-2 weeks. Your provider may recommend over-the-counter medicines to relieve your symptoms.
"
reticulocyte count,"What is a reticulocyte count?
Reticulocytes are red blood cells that are still developing. They are also known as immature red blood cells. Reticulocytes are made in the bone marrow and sent into the bloodstream. About two days after they form, they develop into mature red blood cells. These red blood cells move oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body.
A reticulocyte count (retic count) measures the number of reticulocytes in the blood. If the count is too high or too low, it can mean a serious health problem, including anemia and disorders of the bone marrow, liver, and kidneys.
Other names: retic count, reticulocyte percent, reticulocyte index, reticulocyte production index, RPI
","What is it used for?
A reticulocyte count is most often used to:

Diagnose specific types of anemia. Anemia is a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal amount of red blood cells. There are several different forms and causes of anemia.
See if treatment for anemia is working
See if bone marrow is producing the right amount of blood cells
Check bone marrow function after chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant

","Why do I need a reticulocyte count?
You may need this test if:

Other blood tests show your red blood cell levels are not normal. These tests may include a complete blood count, hemoglobin test, and/or hematocrit test.
You are being treated with radiation or chemotherapy
You recently received a bone marrow transplant

You may also need this test if you have symptoms of anemia. These include:

Fatigue
Weakness
Shortness of breath
Pale skin
Cold hands and/or feet

Sometimes new babies are tested for a condition called hemolytic disease of the newborn. This condition happens when a mother's blood is not compatible with her unborn baby. This is known as Rh incompatibility. It causes the mother's immune system to attack the baby's red blood cells. Most pregnant women are tested for Rh incompatibility as part of routine prenatal screening.
","What happens during a reticulocyte count?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.  This usually takes less than five minutes.
To test a newborn, a health care provider will clean your baby's heel with alcohol and poke the heel with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a reticulocyte count test.
","Are there any risks to the test? 
After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
There is very little risk to your baby with a needle stick test. Your baby may feel a little pinch when the heel is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show a higher than normal amount of reticulocytes (reticulocytosis), it may mean:

You have hemolytic anemia, a type of anemia in which red blood cells are destroyed faster than the bone marrow can replace them.
Your baby has hemolytic disease of the newborn, a condition that limits the ability of a baby's blood to carry oxygen to organs and tissues.

If your results show a lower than normal amount of reticulocytes, it may mean you have:

Iron deficiency anemia, a type of anemia that happens when you don't have enough iron in your body.
Pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by not getting enough of certain B vitamins (B12 and folate) in your diet, or when your body can't absorb enough B vitamins.
Aplastic anemia, a type of anemia that happens when the bone marrow isn't able to make enough blood cells.
Bone marrow failure, which may be caused by an infection or cancer.
Kidney disease
Cirrhosis, scarring of the liver

These test results are often compared with results of other blood tests. If you have questions about your results or your child's results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a reticulocyte count?
If your test results were not normal, it doesn't always mean you have anemia or other health problems. Reticulocyte counts are often higher during pregnancy. Also you may have a temporary increase in your count if you move to a location with a high altitude. The count should return to normal once your body adjusts to the lower oxygen levels that happen in higher altitude environments.
"
rheumatoid factor (rf) test,"What is a rheumatoid factor (RF) test?
A rheumatoid factor (RF) test measures the amount of rheumatoid factor (RF) in your blood. Rheumatoid factors are proteins produced by the immune system. Normally, the immune system attacks disease-causing substances like viruses and bacteria. Rheumatoid factors attack healthy joints, glands, or other normal cells by mistake.
An RF test is most often used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a type of autoimmune disorder that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. Rheumatoid factors may also be a sign of other autoimmune disorders, such as juvenile arthritis, certain infections, and some types of cancer.
Other names: RF Blood Test

","What is it used for?
An RF test is used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders.

","Why do I need an RF test?
You may need an RF test if you have symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These include:

Joint pain

Rheumatoid arthritis
Another autoimmune disease, such lupus, Sjogren's syndrome, juvenile arthritis, or scleroderma
An infection, such as mononucleosis or tuberculosis
Certain cancers, such as leukemia or multiple myeloma

About 20 percent of people with rheumatoid arthritis have little or no rheumatoid factor in their blood. So even if your results were normal, your health care provider may order more tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.
If your results were not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Some healthy people have rheumatoid factor in their blood, but it's not clear why.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an RF test?
An RF test is not used to diagnose osteoarthritis. Although rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis both affect the joints, they are very different diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that affects people at any age, but usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60. It affects more women than men. Symptoms may come and go and vary in severity. Osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. It is caused by the wear and tear of joints over time and usually affects adults over the age of 65.
"
salicylates level,"What is a salicylates level test?
This test measures the amount of salicylates in the blood. Salicylates are a type of drug found in many over-the-counter and prescription medicines. Aspirin is the most common type of salicylate. Popular brand name aspirins include Bayer and Ecotrin.
Aspirin and other salicylates are most often used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation. They also are effective in preventing excessive blood clotting, which can cause a heart attack or stroke. People at risk for these disorders may be advised to take baby aspirin or other low-dose aspirin daily to help prevent dangerous blood clots.
Even though it's called baby aspirin, it's not recommended for babies, older children, or teens. For these age groups, aspirin can cause a life-threatening disorder called Reye syndrome. But aspirin and other salicylates are usually safe and effective for adults when taken at the proper dose. However, if you take too much, it can cause a serious and sometimes fatal condition called salicylate or aspirin poisoning.
Other names: acetylsalicylic acid level test, salicylate serum test, aspirin level test
","What is it used for?
A salicylates level test is most often used to:

Help diagnose acute or gradual aspirin poisoning. Acute aspirin poisoning happens when you take much aspirin at once. Gradual poisoning happens when you take lower doses over a certain period of time.
Monitor people taking prescription-strength aspirin for arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. The test can show whether you are taking enough to treat your disorder or are taking a harmful amount.

","Why do I need a salicylates level test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of acute or gradual aspirin poisoning.
Symptoms of acute aspirin poisoning usually happen three to eight hours after an overdose and may include:

Nausea and vomiting
Rapid breathing (hyperventilation)
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
Sweating

Symptoms of gradual aspirin poisoning may take days or weeks to show up and may include

Rapid heartbeat
Fatigue

","Is there anything else I need to know about a salicylates level test?
A daily dose of low-dose or baby aspirin used to be recommended as a way to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke for many older adults. But daily aspirin use may cause bleeding in the stomach or brain. That is why it is no longer recommended for adults without heart disease risk factors.
Because heart disease is usually more dangerous than the complications from bleeding, it may still be recommended for those at high risk. Risk factors for heart disease include family history and  previous heart attack or stroke.
Before you stop or start taking aspirin, be sure to talk with your health care provider.
"
semen analysis,"What is a semen analysis?
A semen analysis, also called a sperm count, measures the quantity and quality of a man's semen and sperm. Semen is the thick, white fluid released from the penis during a man's sexual climax (orgasm). This release is called ejaculation. Semen contains sperm, the cells in a man that carry genetic material. When a sperm cell unites with an egg from a woman, it forms an embryo (the first stage of an unborn baby's development).
A low sperm count or abnormal sperm shape or movement can make it difficult for a man to make a woman pregnant. The inability to conceive a baby is called infertility. Infertility can affect men and women. For about one-third of couples unable to have children, male infertility is the reason. A semen analysis can help figure out the cause of male infertility.
Other names: sperm count, sperm analysis, semen testing, male fertility test

","What is it used for?
A semen analysis is used to find out if a problem with semen or sperm may be causing a man's infertility.  The test may also be used to see if a vasectomy has been successful. A vasectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to prevent pregnancy by blocking the release of sperm during sex.

","Why do I need a semen analysis?
You may need a semen analysis if you and your partner have been trying to have a baby for at least 12 months without success.
If you've recently had a vasectomy, you may need this test to make sure the procedure has worked.

","What happens during a semen analysis?
You will need to provide a semen sample. The most common way to provide your sample is to go to a private area in your health care provider's office and masturbate into a sterile container. You should not use any lubricants. If masturbation is against your religious or other beliefs, you may be able to collect your sample during intercourse using a special type of condom. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions or concerns about providing your sample.
You will need to provide two or more additional samples within a week or two. That's because sperm count and semen quality can vary from day to day.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You will need to avoid sexual activity, including masturbation, for 2–5 days before the sample is collected. This will help make sure your sperm count is at its highest level.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no known risk to a semen analysis.

","What do the results mean?
The results of a semen analysis include measurements of quantity and quality of semen and sperm. These include:

Volume: the amount of semen
Sperm count: the number of sperm per milliliter
Sperm movement, also known as motility
Sperm shape, also known as morphology
White blood cells, which may be a sign of an infection

If any of these results are not normal, it may mean there is problem with your fertility. But other factors, including the use of alcohol, tobacco, and some herbal medicines, can affect your results. If you have questions about your results or other concerns about your fertility, talk to your health care provider.
If your semen analysis was done to check the success of your vasectomy, your provider will look for the presence of any sperm. If no sperm is found, you and your partner should be able to stop using other forms of birth control. If sperm is found, you may need repeat testing until your sample is clear of sperm. In the meantime, you and your partner will have to take precautions in order to prevent pregnancy.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

shbg blood test,"What is an SHBG blood test?This test measures the levels of SHBG in your blood. SHBG stands for sex hormone binding globulin. It's a protein made by the liver and attaches itself to sex hormones found in both men and women. These hormones are:Testosterone, the main sex hormone in menDihydrotestosterone (DHT), another male sex hormoneEstradiol, a form of estrogen, the main sex hormone in womenSHBG controls how much of these hormones are delivered to the body's tissues. Although SHBG attaches to all three of these hormones, an SHBG test is mostly used to look at testosterone. SHBG levels can show if there is too much or too little testosterone being used by the body.Other names: testosterone-estrogen binding globulin, TeBG
","What is it used for?An SHBG test is most often used to find out how much testosterone is going to the body's tissues. Testosterone levels can be measured in a separate test called total testosterone. This test shows how much testosterone is in the body, but not how much is being used by the body.Sometimes a total testosterone test is enough to make a diagnosis. But some people have symptoms of too much or too little of the hormone that the total testosterone test results can't explain. In these cases, an SHBG test may be ordered to provide more information about how much testosterone is available to the body.
","Why do I need an SHBG blood test?You may need this test if you have symptoms of abnormal testosterone levels, especially if a total testosterone test can't explain your symptoms. For men, it's mostly ordered if there are symptoms of low testosterone levels. For women, it's mostly ordered if there are symptoms of high testosterone levels.Symptoms of low testosterone levels in men include:Low sex driveDifficulty getting an erectionFertility problemsSymptoms of high testosterone levels in women include:Excess body and facial hair growthDeepening of voiceMenstrual irregularitiesAcneWeight gainFertility problems
","What happens during an SHBG blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","What do the results mean?If your results show your SHBG levels are too low, it may mean the protein is not attaching itself to enough testosterone. This allows more unattached testosterone to be available in your system. It may cause too much testosterone to go to your body's tissues.If your SHBG levels are too high, it may mean the protein is attaching itself to too much testosterone. So less of the hormone is available, and your tissues may be not be getting enough testosterone.If your SHBG levels are too low, it can be a sign of:Hypothyroidism, a condition in which your body doesn't make enough thyroid hormonesType 2 diabetesOveruse of steroid medicationsCushing's syndrome, a condition in which your body makes too much of a hormone called cortisolFor men, it can mean cancer of the testicles or adrenal glands. Adrenal glands are located above the kidneys and help control heart rate, blood pressure, and other bodily functions.For women, it can mean polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting childbearing women. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.If your SHBG levels are too high, it can be a sign of:Liver diseaseHyperthyroidism, a condition in which your body makes too much thyroid hormoneEating disordersFor men, it can mean a problem with the testicles or pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located beneath the brain and controls many body functions.For women, it can mean problem with the pituitary gland, or Addison disease. Addison disease is a disorder in which the adrenal glands are not able to make enough of certain hormones.Your health care provider may order additional tests such as total testosterone or estrogen tests to help make a diagnosis. If you have questions about your results, talk to your provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an SHBG blood test?SHBG levels are normally high in children of both sexes, so the test is almost always used for adults.
"
skin biopsy,"What is a skin biopsy?
A skin biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of skin for testing. The skin sample is looked at under a microscope to check for skin cancer, skin infections, or skin disorders such as psoriasis.
There are three main ways to do a skin biopsy:

A punch biopsy, which uses a special circular tool to remove the sample.
A shave biopsy, which removes the sample with a razor blade
An excisional biopsy, which removes the sample with small knife called a scalpel.

The type of biopsy you get depends on the location and size of the abnormal area of skin, known as a skin lesion. Most skin biopsies can be done in a health care provider's office or other outpatient facility.
Other names: punch biopsy, shave biopsy, excisional biopsy, skin cancer biopsy, basal cell biopsy, squamous cell biopsy, melanoma biopsy

","What is it used for?
A skin biopsy is used to help diagnose a variety of skin conditions including:

Skin disorders such as psoriasis and eczema
Bacterial or fungal infections of the skin
Skin cancer. A biopsy can confirm or rule out whether a suspicious mole or other growth is cancerous.

Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell cancers. These cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body and are usually curable with treatment. A third type of skin cancer is called melanoma. Melanoma is less common than the other two, but more dangerous because it's more likely to spread. Most skin cancer deaths are caused by melanoma.
A skin biopsy can help diagnose skin cancer in the early stages, when it's easier to treat.

","Why do I need a skin biopsy?
You may need a skin biopsy if you have certain skin symptoms such as:

A persistent rash
Scaly or rough skin
Open sores
A mole or other growth that is irregular in shape, color, and/or size


","What happens during a skin biopsy?
A health care provider will clean the site and inject an anesthetic so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. The rest of the procedure steps depend on which type of skin biopsy you are getting. There are three main types:
Punch biopsy

A health care provider will place a special circular tool over the abnormal skin area (lesion) and rotate it to remove a small piece of skin (about the size of a pencil eraser).
The sample will be lifted out with a special tool
If a larger skin sample was taken, you may need one or two stitches to cover the biopsy site.
Pressure will be applied to the site until the bleeding stops.
The site will be covered with a bandage or sterile dressing.

A punch biopsy is often used to diagnose rashes.
Shave biopsy

A health care provider will use a razor or a scalpel to remove a sample from the top layer of your skin.
Pressure will be applied to the biopsy site to stop the bleeding. You may also get a medicine that goes on top of the skin (also called a topical medicine) to help stop the bleeding.

A shave biopsy is often used if your provider thinks you may have skin cancer, or if you have a rash that's limited to the top layer of your skin.
Excisional biopsy

A surgeon will use a scalpel to remove the entire skin lesion (the abnormal area of skin).
The surgeon will close the biopsy site with stitches.
Pressure will be applied to the site until the bleeding stops.
The site will be covered with a bandage or sterile dressing.

An excisional biopsy is often used if your provider thinks you may have melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.
After the biopsy, keep the area covered with a bandage until you've healed, or until your stitches come out. If you had stitches, they will be taken out 3–14 days after your procedure.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a skin biopsy.

","Are there any risks to the test?
You may have a little bruising, bleeding, or soreness at the biopsy site. If these symptoms last longer than a few days or they get worse, talk to your health care provider.

","What do the results mean?
If your results were normal, it means no cancer or skin disease was found. If your results were not normal, you may be diagnosed with one of the following conditions:

A bacterial or fungal infection
A skin disorder such as psoriasis
Skin cancer. Your results may indicate one of three types of skin cancers: basal cell, squamous cell, or melanoma.

Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a skin biopsy?
If you are diagnosed with basal cell or squamous cell cancer, the entire cancerous lesion may be removed at the time of the skin biopsy or soon after. Often, no other treatment is needed. If you are diagnosed with melanoma, you will need more tests to see if the cancer has spread. Then you and your health care provider can develop a treatment plan that's right for you.

skin cancer screening,"What is a skin cancer screening?A skin cancer screening is a visual exam of the skin that can be done by yourself or a health care provider. The screening checks the skin for moles, birthmarks, or other marks that are unusual in color, size, shape, or texture. Certain unusual marks may be signs of skin cancer.Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer in the United States. The most common types of skin cancer are basal cell and squamous cell cancers. These cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body and are usually curable with treatment. A third type of skin cancer is called melanoma. Melanoma is less common than the other two, but more dangerous because it's more likely to spread. Most skin cancer deaths are caused by melanoma.A skin cancer screening can help find cancer in its earlier stages when it's easier to treat.Other names: skin exam
","What is it used for?A skin cancer screening is used to look for signs of skin cancer. It is not used to diagnose cancer. If skin cancer is suspected after a screening, a test called a biopsy will be needed to find out whether you have cancer.
","Why do I need a skin cancer screening?You may need a skin cancer screening if you have certain risk factors. Risk factors for skin cancer include having:Light skin toneBlond or red hairLight colored eyes (blue or green)Skin that burns and/or freckles easilyHistory of sunburnsFamily and/or personal history of skin cancerFrequent exposure to the sun through work or leisure activitiesLarge number of molesTalk to your health provider about whether you should regularly screen yourself, get screened at a provider's office, or do both.If you are screening yourself, you may need to get screened by a health care provider if you find signs of skin cancer during a self-exam. Signs vary depending on the type of skin cancer, but they may include a:Change in an existing mole or spotMole or other skin mark that oozes, bleeds, or becomes crustyMole that is painful to the touchSore that doesn't heal within two weeksShiny pink, red, pearly white, or translucent bumpMole or sore with irregular borders, that may bleed easilyIf you are screening yourself, be sure to check for signs of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer. An easy way to remember the signs of melanoma is to think of ""ABCDE,"" which stands for:Asymmetry: The mole has an odd shape, with half of it not matching the other half.Border: The border of the mole is ragged or irregular.Color: The color of the mole is uneven.Diameter: The mole is bigger than the size of a pea or a pencil eraser.Evolving: The mole has changed in size, shape, or color.If you find signs of melanoma, talk to your health care provider as soon as possible.
","What happens during a skin cancer screening?Skin cancer screenings may be done by yourself, your primary care provider, or a dermatologist. A dermatologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the skin.If you are screening yourself, you will need to do a head-to-toe exam of your skin. The exam should be done in a well-lit room in front of a full-length mirror. You'll also need a hand mirror to check areas that are hard to see. The exam should include the following steps:Stand in front of the mirror and look at your face, neck, and stomach.Women should look under their breasts.Raise your arms and look at your left and right sides.Look at the front and back of your forearms.Look at your hands, including between your fingers and under your fingernails.Look at the front, back, and sides of your legs.Sit down and examine your feet, checking the soles and the spaces between the toes. Also check the nail beds of each toe.Check your back, buttocks, and genitals with the hand mirror.Part your hair and examine your scalp. Use a comb or a hair dryer along with a hand mirror to help you see better.If you are getting screened by a dermatologist or other health care provider, it may include the follow steps:You will remove all your clothing. But you can wear a gown. If you are uncomfortable being undressed in front of your provider, you can ask to have a nurse in the room with you during the exam.Your provider will give you a head-to-toe exam, including your scalp, behind your ears, fingers, toes, buttocks, and genitals. The exam may be embarrassing, but it's important to get checked, as skin cancer can occur anywhere on your skin.Your provider may use a special magnifying glass with a light to look at certain marks.The exam should take 10-15 minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You should not wear makeup or nail polish. Be sure to wear your hair loose, so your provider can examine your scalp. There are no other special preparations needed.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no risks to having a skin cancer screening.
","What do the results mean?If a mole or other mark on your skin looks like it might be a sign of cancer, your provider will probably order another test, called a skin biopsy, to make a diagnosis. A skin biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of skin for testing. The skin sample is looked at under a microscope to check for cancer cells. If you are diagnosed with skin cancer, you can begin treatment. Finding and treating cancer early may help prevent the disease from spreading.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a skin cancer screening?Exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the sun plays a major role in causing skin cancer. You are exposed to these rays anytime you are out in the sun, not just when you are at the beach or pool. But you can limit your sun exposure and help reduce your risk of skin cancer if you take a few simple precautions when out in the sun. These include:Using a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30Seeking shade when possibleWearing a hat and sunglassesSunbathing also increases your risk of skin cancer. You should avoid outdoor sunbathing and never use an indoor tanning salon. There is no safe amount of exposure to artificial tanning beds, sunlamps, or other artificial tanning devices.If you have questions about reducing your risk of skin cancer, talk to your health care provider.
"
smooth muscle antibody (sma) test,"What is a smooth muscle antibody (SMA) test?This test looks for smooth muscle antibodies (SMAs) in the blood. A smooth muscle antibody (SMA) is a type of antibody known as an autoantibody. Normally, your immune system makes antibodies to attack foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. An autoantibody attacks the body's own cells and tissues by mistake. SMAs attack smooth muscle tissues in the liver and other parts of the body.If SMAs are found in your blood, it is likely you have autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a disease in which the immune system attacks liver tissues. There are two types of autoimmune hepatitis:Type 1, the most common form of the disease. Type 1 affects more women than men. It is also more common in people who also have another autoimmune disorder.Type 2, a less common form of the disease. Type 2 mostly affects girls between the ages of 2 and 14.Autoimmune hepatitis can be managed with medicines that suppress the immune system. Treatment is more effective when the disorder is found early. Without treatment, autoimmune hepatitis can cause serious health problems, including cirrhosis and liver failure.Other names: anti-smooth muscle antibody, ASMA, actin antibody, ACTA
","What is it used for?
An SMA test is primarily used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis. It is also used to find out if the disorder is type 1 or type 2.
SMA tests are also often used along with other tests to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. These other tests include:

A test for F-actin antibodies. F-actin is a protein found in smooth muscle tissues of the liver and other parts of the body. F-actin antibodies attack these healthy tissues.
ANA (antinuclear antibody) test. ANAs are antibodies that attack the nucleus (center) of certain healthy cells.
ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate aminotransferase) tests. ALT and AST are two enzymes made by the liver.

","Why do I need an SMA test?You may need this test if you or your child has symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis. These include:FatigueJaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow)Abdominal painJoint painNauseaSkin rashesLoss of appetiteDark-colored urine
","What happens during an SMA test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for an SMA test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your results show a high amount of SMA antibodies, it probably means you have the type 1 form of autoimmune hepatitis. A lower amount may mean you have the type 2 form of the disease.If no SMAs were found, it means your liver symptoms are being caused by something different than autoimmune hepatitis. Your health care provider will need to order more tests to make a diagnosis.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about an SMA test?If your results showed that you or your child has SMA antibodies, your provider may order a liver biopsy to confirm a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing.
"
sodium blood test,"What is a sodium blood test?A sodium blood test measures the amount of sodium in your blood. Sodium is a type of electrolyte. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help maintain fluid levels and the balance of chemicals in your body called acids and bases. Sodium also helps your nerves and muscles work properly.You get most of the sodium you need in your diet. Once your body takes in enough sodium, the kidneys get rid of the rest in your urine. If your sodium blood levels are too high or too low, it may mean that you have a problem with your kidneys, dehydration, or another medical condition.Other names: Na test
","What is it used for?A sodium blood test may be part of a test called an electrolyte panel. An electrolyte panel is a blood test that measures sodium, along with other electrolytes, including potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate.
","Why do I need a sodium blood test?Your health care provider may have ordered a sodium blood test as part of your regular checkup or if you have symptoms of too much sodium (hypernatremia) or too little sodium (hyponatremia) in your blood.Symptoms of high sodium levels (hypernatremia) include:Excess thirstInfrequent urinationVomitingDiarrheaSymptoms of low sodium levels (hyponatremia) include:WeaknessFatigueConfusionMuscle twitching
","What happens during a sodium blood test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a sodium blood test or an electrolyte panel. If your health care provider has ordered more tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your results show higher than normal sodium levels, it may indicate:DiarrheaA disorder of the adrenal glandsA kidney disorderDiabetes insipidus, a rare form of diabetes that happens when the kidneys pass an unusually high volume of urine.If your results show lower than normal sodium levels, it may indicate:DiarrheaVomitingKidney diseaseAddison disease, a condition in which your body's adrenal glands don't produce enough of certain types of hormonesCirrhosis, a condition that causes scarring of the liver and can damage liver functionMalnutritionHeart failureIf your results are not in the normal range, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have a medical condition needing treatment. Certain medicines can increase or decrease your sodium levels. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I should know about a sodium blood test?Sodium levels are often measured with other electrolytes in another test called the anion gap. An anion gap test looks at the difference between negatively charged and positively charged electrolytes. The test checks for acid imbalances and other conditions.
"
ultrasound,"What is an ultrasound?An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture (also known as a sonogram) of organs, tissues, and other structures inside the body. Unlike x-rays, ultrasounds don’t use any radiation. An ultrasound can also show parts of the body in motion, such as a heart beating or blood flowing through blood vessels.There are two main categories of ultrasounds: pregnancy ultrasound and diagnostic ultrasound.Pregnancy ultrasound is used to look at an unborn baby. The test can provide information about a baby’s growth, development, and overall health.Diagnostic ultrasound is used to view and provide information about other internal parts of the body. These include the heart, blood vessels, liver, bladder, kidneys, and female reproductive organs.Other names: sonogram, ultrasonography, pregnancy sonography, fetal ultrasound, obstetric ultrasound, diagnostic medical sonography, diagnostic medical ultrasound
","What is it used for?An ultrasound can be used in different ways, depending on the type of ultrasound and which part of the body is being checked.A pregnancy ultrasound is done to get information about the health of an unborn baby. It may be used to:Confirm that you are pregnant.Check the size and position of the unborn baby.Check to see you are pregnant with more than one baby.Estimate how long you have been pregnant. This is known as gestational age.Check for signs of Down syndrome, which include thickening in the back of the baby's neck.Check for birth defects in the brain, spinal cord, heart, or other parts of the body.Check the amount of amniotic fluid. Amniotic fluid is a clear liquid that surrounds an unborn baby during pregnancy. It protects the baby from outside injury and cold. It also helps promote lung development and bone growth.Diagnostic ultrasound may be used to:Find out if blood is flowing at a normal rate and level.See if there is a problem with the structure of your heart.Look for blockages in the gallbladder.Check the thyroid gland for cancer or non-cancerous growths.Check for abnormalities in the abdomen and kidneys.Help guide a biopsy procedure. A biopsy is a procedure that removes a small sample of tissue for testing.In women, diagnostic ultrasound may be used to:Look at a breast lump to see if it might be cancer. (The test may also be used to check for breast cancer in men, though this type of cancer is far more common in women.)Help find the cause of pelvic pain.Help find the cause of abnormal menstrual bleeding.Help diagnose infertility or monitor infertility treatments.In men, diagnostic ultrasound may be used to help diagnose disorders of the prostate gland.
","Why do I need an ultrasound?You may need a ultrasound if you are pregnant. There is no radiation used in the test. It offers a safe way of checking the health of your unborn baby.You may need diagnostic ultrasound if you have symptoms in certain organs or tissues. These include the heart, kidneys, thyroid, gallbladder, and female reproductive system. You may also need ultrasound if you are getting a biopsy. The ultrasound helps your health care provider get a clear image of the area that is being tested.
","What happens during an ultrasound?A ultrasound usually includes the following steps:You will lie on a table, exposing the area that’s being viewed.A health care provider will spread a special gel on the skin over that area.The provider will move a wand-like device, called a transducer, over the area.The device sends sound waves into your body. The waves are so high pitched that you can’t hear them.The waves are recorded and turned into images on a monitor.You may be able to view the images as they are being made. This often happens during a pregnancy ultrasound, allowing you to look at your unborn baby.After the test is over, the provider will wipe the gel off your body.The test takes about 30 to 60 minutes to complete.In some cases, a pregnancy ultrasound may be done by inserting the transducer into the vagina. This is most often done early in pregnancy.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?The preparations will depend on which type of ultrasound you are having. For ultrasounds of the abdominal area, including pregnancy ultrasounds and ultrasounds of the female reproductive system, you may need to fill up your bladder before the test. This involves drinking two to three glasses of water about an hour before the test, and not going to the bathroom. For other ultrasounds, you may need to adjust your diet or to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before your test. Some types of ultrasounds require no preparation at all.Your health care provider will let you know if you need to do anything to prepare for your ultrasound.
","Are there any risks to the test?There are no known risks to having an ultrasound. It is considered safe during pregnancy.
","What do the results mean?If your pregnancy ultrasound results were normal, it doesn’t guarantee you’ll have a healthy baby. No test can do that. But normal results may mean:Your baby is growing at a normal rate.You have the right amount of amniotic fluid.No birth defects were found, though not all birth defects will show up on an ultrasound.If your pregnancy ultrasound results were not normal, it may mean:The baby is not growing at a normal rate.You have too much or too little amniotic fluid.The baby is growing outside the uterus. This is called an ectopic pregnancy. A baby can’t survive an ectopic pregnancy, and the condition can be life threatening for the mother.There is a problem with the baby’s position in the uterus. This could make delivery more difficult.Your baby has a birth defect.If your pregnancy ultrasound results were not normal, it doesn’t always mean your baby has a serious health problem. Your provider may suggest more tests to help confirm a diagnosis.If you had diagnostic ultrasound, the meaning of your results will depend on which part of the body was being looked at.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
",
sputum culture,"What is a sputum culture?
A sputum culture is a test that checks for bacteria or another type of organism that may be causing an infection in your lungs or the airways leading to the lungs. Sputum, also known as phlegm, is a thick type of mucus made in your lungs. If you have an infection or chronic illness affecting the lungs or airways, it can make you cough up sputum.
Sputum is not the same as spit or saliva. Sputum contains cells from the immune system that help fight the bacteria, fungi, or other foreign substances in your lungs or airways. The thickness of sputum helps trap the foreign material. This allows cilia (tiny hairs) in the airways to push it through the mouth and be coughed out.
Sputum can be one of several different colors. The colors can help identify the type of infection you may have or if a chronic illness has become worse:

Clear. This usually means no disease is present, but large amounts of clear sputum may be a sign of lung disease.
White or gray. This may also be normal, but increased amounts may mean lung disease.
Dark yellow or green. This often means a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia. Yellowish-green sputum is also common in people with cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs and other organs.
Brown. This often shows up in people who smoke. It is also a common sign of black lung disease. Black lung disease is a serious condition that can happen if you have long-term exposure to coal dust.
Pink. This may be a sign of pulmonary edema, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the lungs. Pulmonary edema is common in people with congestive heart failure.
Red. This may be an early sign of lung cancer. It may also be a sign of a pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening condition in which a blood clot from a leg or other part of the body breaks loose and travels to the lungs. If you are coughing up red or bloody sputum, call 911 or seek immediate medical attention.

Other names: respiratory culture, bacterial sputum culture, routine sputum culture
","What is it used for?
A sputum culture is most often used to:

Find and diagnose bacteria or fungi that may be causing an infection in the lungs or airways.
See if a chronic illness of the lungs has worsened.
See if treatment for an infection is working.

A sputum culture is often done with another test called a Gram stain. A Gram stain is a test that checks for bacteria at the site of a suspected infection or in body fluids such as blood or urine. It can help identify the specific type of infection you may have.
","Why do I need a sputum culture?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of pneumonia or another serious infection of the lungs or airways. These include:

Cough which produces a lot of sputum
Fever
Chills
Shortness of breath
Chest pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough
Fatigue
Confusion, especially in older people

","What happens during a sputum culture?
Your health care provider will need to get a sample of your sputum. During the test:

A health care provider will ask you to breathe deeply and then cough deeply into a special cup.
Your provider may tap you on the chest to help loosen sputum from your lungs.
If you have trouble coughing up enough sputum, your provider may ask you to breathe in a salty mist that can help you cough more deeply.
If you still can't cough up enough sputum, your provider may perform a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, you'll first get a medicine to help you relax, and then a numbing medicine so you won't feel any pain.
Then a thin, lighted tube will be put through your mouth or nose and into the airways.
Your provider will collect a sample from your airway using a small brush or suction.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to rinse your mouth out with water before the sample is taken. If you will be getting a bronchoscopy, you may be asked to fast (not eat or drink) for one to two hours before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no risk to providing a sputum sample into a container. If you had a bronchoscopy, your throat may feel sore after the procedure.
","What do the results mean?
If your results were normal, it means no harmful bacteria or fungi were found. If your results were not normal, it may mean you have some kind of bacterial or fungal infection. Your provider may need to do more tests to find the specific type of infection you have. The most common types of harmful bacteria found in a sputum culture include those that cause:

Pneumonia
Bronchitis
Tuberculosis

An abnormal sputum culture result may also mean a flare-up of a chronic condition, such as cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a lung disease that makes it hard to breathe.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a sputum culture?
Sputum may be referred to as phlegm or mucus. All terms are correct, but sputum and phlegm only refer to the mucus made in the respiratory system (lungs and airways). Sputum (phlegm) is a type of mucus. Mucus can also be made elsewhere in the body, such as the urinary or genital tract.
"
stool elastase,"What is a stool elastase test?
This test measures the amount of elastase in your stool. Elastase is an enzyme made by special tissue in the pancreas, an organ in your upper abdomen. Elastase helps break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates after you eat. It's a key part of your digestive process.
In a healthy pancreas, elastase will be passed in the stool. If little or no elastase is found in your stool, it can mean this enzyme isn't working as it should. This is called pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency can cause a number of health problems, including malabsorption and malnutrition, disorders that affect your ability to digest and take in nutrients from food.
In adults, pancreatic insufficiency is often a sign of chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-lasting condition that tends to get worse over time. It can lead to permanent damage of the pancreas. Acute pancreatitis, another form of the disease, is a short-term condition. It is usually diagnosed with blood and/or imaging tests, rather than a stool elastase test.
In children, pancreatic insufficiency can be a sign of:

Cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that causes mucus to build up in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, a rare, inherited disease that causes problems with the skeletal system, bone marrow, and pancreas

Other names: pancreatic elastase, fecal pancreatic elastase, fecal elastase, FE-1
","What is it used for?A stool elastase test is used to find out if there is pancreatic insufficiency. This test is better at finding severe pancreatic insufficiency, rather than mild or moderate cases.Pancreatic insufficiency can sometimes be a sign of pancreatic cancer, but this test is not used to screen for or diagnose cancer.
","Why do I need a stool elastase test?You may need a stool elastase test if you or your child has symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency. These include:Abdominal painSmelly, greasy stoolsMalabsorption, a disorder that affects your ability to digest and absorb nutrients from food. It can cause malnutrition, a condition in which your body does not get the calories, vitamins, and/or minerals needed for good health.Losing weight without trying. In children, this can delay growth and development.
","What happens during a stool elastase test?You will need to provide a stool sample. Your provider or your child's provider will give you specific instructions on how to collect and send in your sample. Your instructions may include the following:Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves.Collect and store the stool in a special container given to you by your health care provider or a lab. You may get a device or applicator to help you collect the sample.Make sure no urine, toilet water, or toilet paper mixes in with the sample.Seal and label the container.Remove the gloves, and wash your hands.Return the container to your health care provider or the lab by mail or in person.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?If you are taking pancreatic enzyme supplements, you may need to stop taking them for five days before the test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is no known risk to having a stool elastase test.
","What do the results mean?If your results show a low amount of elastase, it probably means you have pancreatic insufficiency. Your provider will probably order more tests to diagnose the cause of the insufficiency. These tests may include:Blood tests to measure levels of pancreatic enzymesImaging tests to look at the pancreas and surrounding organsYour child's health care provider may order different types of tests to help diagnose cystic fibrosis or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a stool elastase test?If you are diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, there are treatments that can help manage your condition.

"
strep a test,"What is a strep A test?
Strep A, also known as group A strep, is a type of bacteria that causes strep throat and other infections. Strep throat is an infection that affects the throat and tonsils. The infection is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. While you can get strep throat at any age, it's most common in children 5 to 15 years old.
Strep throat can be easily treated with antibiotics. But left untreated, strep throat can lead to serious complications. These include rheumatic fever, a disease that can damage the heart and joints, and glomerulonephritis, a type of kidney disease.
Strep A tests check for strep A infections. There are two types of strep A tests:

Rapid strep test. This test looks for antigens to strep A. Antigens are substances that cause an immune response. A rapid strep test can provide results in 10–20 minutes. If a rapid test is negative, but your provider thinks you or your child has strep throat, he or she may order a throat culture.
Throat culture. This test looks for strep A bacteria. It provides a more accurate diagnosis than a rapid test, but it can take 24–48 hours to get results.

Other names: strep throat test, throat culture, group A streptococcus (GAS) throat culture, rapid strep test, streptococcus pyogenes
","What is it used for?
A strep A test is most often used to find out if a sore throat and other symptoms are being caused by strep throat or by a viral infection. Strep throat needs to be treated with antibiotics to prevent complications. Most sore throats are caused by viruses. Antibiotics don't work on viral infections. Viral sore throats usually go away on their own.
","Why do I need a strep A test?
Your health care provider may order a strep A test if you or your child has symptoms of strep throat. These include:

A sudden and severe sore throat
Pain or difficulty swallowing
Fever of 101° or more
Swollen lymph nodes

Your provider may also order a strep A test if you or your child has a rough, red rash that starts on the face and spreads to another part of the body. This type of rash is a sign of scarlet fever, an illness that can happen a few days after you've been infected with strep A. Like strep throat, scarlet fever is easily treated with antibiotics.
If you have symptoms such as a cough or runny nose along with your sore throat, it's more likely that you have a viral infection rather than strep throat.
","What happens during a strep A test?
A rapid test and a throat culture are done in the same way. During the procedure:

You will be asked to tilt your head back and open your mouth as wide as possible.
Your health care provider will use a tongue depressor to hold down your tongue.
He or she will use a special swab to take a sample from the back of your throat and tonsils.
The sample may be used to do a rapid strep test in the provider's office. Sometimes the sample is sent to a lab.
Your provider may take a second sample and send it to a lab for a throat culture if necessary.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for a rapid strep test or a throat culture.
","Are there any risks to the test? 
There is no risk to having swab tests, but they may cause slight discomfort and/or gagging.
","What do the results mean?
If you or your child has a positive result on a rapid strep test, it means you have strep throat or another strep A infection. No further testing will be needed.
If the rapid test was negative, but the provider thinks you or your child might have strep throat, he or she may order a throat culture. If you or your child has not already provided a sample, you will get another swab test.
If the throat culture was positive, it means you or your child has strep throat or other strep infection.
If the throat culture was negative, it means your symptoms are not being caused by strep A bacteria. Your provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis.
If you or your child was diagnosed with strep throat, you will need to take antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. After a day or two of taking the medicine, you or your child should start to feel better. Most people are no longer contagious after taking antibiotics for 24 hours. But it's important to take all the medicine as prescribed. Stopping early can lead to rheumatic fever or other serious complications.

Strep A can cause other infections besides strep throat. These infections are less common than strep throat but are often more serious. They include toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis, also known as flesh-eating bacteria.
There are also other kinds of strep bacteria. These include strep B, which can cause a dangerous infection in newborns, and streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes the most common type of pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumonia bacteria can also cause infections of the ear, sinuses, and bloodstream.
"
strep b test,"What is a group B strep test?
Strep B, also known as group B strep (GBS), is a type of bacteria commonly found in the digestive tract, urinary tract, and genital area. It rarely causes symptoms or problems in adults but can be deadly to newborns.
In women, GBS is mostly found in the vagina and rectum. So a pregnant woman who is infected can pass the bacteria to her baby during labor and delivery. GBS can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other serious illnesses in a baby. GBS infections are the leading cause of death and disability in newborns.
A group B strep test checks for GBS bacteria. If the test shows that a pregnant woman has GBS, she can take antibiotics during labor to protect her baby from infection.
Other names: group B streptococcus, group B beta-hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus agalactiae, beta-hemolytic strep culture
","What is it used for?
A group B strep test is most often used to look for GBS bacteria in pregnant women. Most pregnant women are tested as part of routine prenatal screening. It may also be used to test infants who show signs of infection.
","Why do I need a group B strep test?
You may need a strep B test if you are pregnant. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends GBS testing for all pregnant women. Testing is usually done in the 36th or 37th week of pregnancy. If you go into labor earlier than 36 weeks, you may be tested at that time.
A baby may need a group B strep test if he or she has symptoms of infection. These include:

High fever
Trouble with feeding
Trouble breathing
Lack of energy (hard to wake up)

","What happens during a group B strep test?
If you are pregnant, your health care provider may order a swab test or a urine test.
For a swab test, you will lie on your back on an exam table. Your health care provider will use a
small cotton swab to take a sample of cells and fluids from your vagina and rectum.
For a urine test, you will most likely be told to use the ""clean catch method"" to ensure your sample is sterile. It includes the following steps.

Wash your hands.
Clean your genital area with a cleansing pad given to you by your provider. To clean, open your labia and wipe from front to back.
Start to urinate into the toilet.
Move the collection container under your urine stream.
Collect at least an ounce or two of urine into the container, which should have markings to indicate the amounts.
Finish urinating into the toilet.
Return the sample container as instructed by your health care provider.

If your baby needs testing, a provider may do a blood test or a spinal tap.
For a blood test, a health care professional will use a small needle to take a blood sample from your baby's heel. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. Your baby may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
A spinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture, is a test that collects and looks at spinal fluid, the clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. During the procedure:

A nurse or other health care provider will hold your baby in a curled-up position.
A health care provider will clean your baby's back and inject an anesthetic into the skin, so your baby won't feel pain during the procedure. The provider may put a numbing cream on your baby's back before this injection.
The provider may also give your baby a sedative and/or pain reliever to help him or her better tolerate the procedure.
Once the area on the back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in the lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up the spine.
The provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't any special preparations for group B strep tests.
","Are there any risks to the test? 
There is no risk to you from a swab or urine test. Your baby may have slight pain or bruising after a blood test, but that should go away quickly. Your baby will likely feel some pain after a spinal tap, but that shouldn't last too long. There is also a small risk of infection or bleeding after a spinal tap.
","What do the results mean?
If you are pregnant and results show you have GBS bacteria, you will be given antibiotics intravenously (by IV) during labor, at least four hours before delivery. This will prevent you from passing the bacteria to your baby. Taking antibiotics earlier in your pregnancy is not effective, because the bacteria can grow back very quickly. It's also more effective to take antibiotics through your vein, rather than by mouth.
You may not need antibiotics if you are having a planned delivery by Cesarean section (C-section). During a C-section, a baby is delivered through the mother's abdomen rather than vaginally. But you still should be tested during pregnancy because you may go into labor before your scheduled C-section.
If your baby's results show a GBS infection, he or she will be treated with antibiotics. If your provider suspects a GBS infection, he or she may treat your baby before test results are available. This is because GBS can cause serious illness or death.
If you have questions about your results or your baby's results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

stress tests,"What are stress tests?Stress tests show how well your heart handles physical activity. Your heart pumps harder and faster when you exercise. Some heart disorders are easier to find when your heart is hard at work. During a stress test, your heart will be checked while you exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. If you're not healthy enough to exercise, you'll be given a medicine that makes your heart beat faster and harder, as if you were actually exercising.If you have trouble completing the stress test in a specified period of time, it may mean there is reduced blood flow to your heart. Reduced blood flow can be caused by several different heart conditions, some of which are very serious.Other names: exercise stress test, treadmill test, stress EKG, stress ECG, nuclear stress test, stress echocardiogram
","What are they used for?Stress tests are most often used to:Diagnose coronary artery disease, a condition that causes a waxy substance called plaque to build up in the arteries. It can cause dangerous blockages in blood flow to the heart.Diagnose arrhythmia, a condition that causes an irregular heartbeatFind out what level of exercise is safe for youFind out how well your treatment is working if you've already been diagnosed with heart diseaseShow if you are at risk for a heart attack or other serious heart condition
","Why do I need a stress test?You may need a stress test if you have symptoms of limited blood flow to your heart. These include:Angina, a type of chest pain or discomfort caused by poor blood flow to the heartShortness of breathRapid heartbeatIrregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). This may feel like a fluttering in your chest.You may also need a stress test to check your heart health if you:Are planning to start an exercise programHave had recent heart surgeryAre being treated for heart disease. The test can show how well your treatment is working.Have had a heart attack in the pastAre at a higher risk for heart disease due to health problems such as diabetes, family history of heart disease, and/or previous heart problems
","What happens during a stress test?There are three main types of stress tests: exercise stress tests, nuclear stress tests, and stress echocardiograms. All types of stress tests may be done in a health care provider's office, outpatient clinic, or hospital.During an exercise stress test:A health care provider will place several electrodes (small sensors that stick to the skin) on your arms, legs, and chest. The provider may need to shave excess hair before placing the electrodes.The electrodes are attached by wires to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine, which records your heart's electrical activity.You will then walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle, starting slowly.Then, you'll walk or pedal faster, with the incline and resistance increasing as you go.You'll continue walking or riding until you reach a target heart rate set by your provider. You may need to stop sooner if you develop symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue. The test may also be stopped if the EKG shows a problem with your heart.After the test, you'll be monitored for 10–15 minutes or until your heart rate returns to normal.Both nuclear stress tests and stress echocardiograms are imaging tests. That means that pictures will be taken of your heart during testing.During a nuclear stress test:You will lie down on an exam table.A health care provider will insert an intravenous (IV) line into your arm. The IV contains a radioactive dye. The dye makes it possible for the health care provider to view images of your heart. It takes between 15–40 minutes for the heart to absorb the dye.A special camera will scan your heart to create the images, which show your heart at rest.The rest of the test is just like an exercise stress test. You'll be hooked up to an EKG machine, then walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bicycle.If you are not healthy enough to exercise, you'll get a medicine that makes your heart beat faster and harder.When your heart is working at its hardest, you'll get another injection of the radioactive dye.You'll wait for about 15-40 minutes for your heart to absorb the dye.You'll resume exercising and the special camera will take more pictures of your heart.Your provider will compare the two sets of images: one of your heart at rest; the other while hard at work.After the test, you'll be monitored for 10-15 minutes or until your heart rate returns to normal.The radioactive dye will naturally leave your body through your urine. Drinking lots of water will help remove it faster.During a stress echocardiogram:You will lie on an exam table.The provider will rub a special gel on a wand-like device called a transducer. He or she will hold the transducer against your chest.This device makes sound waves, which create moving pictures of your heart.After these images are taken, you will exercise on treadmill or bicycle, as in the other types of stress tests.If you are not healthy enough to exercise, you'll get a medicine that makes your heart beat faster and harder.More images will be taken when your heart rate is increasing or when it's working at its hardest.Your provider will compare the two sets of images; one of your heart at rest; the other while hard at work.After the test, you'll be monitored for 10–15 minutes or until your heart rate returns to normal.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You should wear comfortable shoes and loose clothing to make it easier to exercise. Your provider may ask you to not eat or drink for several hours before the test. If you have questions about how to prepare, talk to your health care provider.
","Are there any risks to the test?Stress tests are usually safe. Sometimes exercise or the medicine that increases your heart rate can cause symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea. You will be monitored closely throughout the test to reduce your risk of complications or to quickly treat any health problems. The radioactive dye used in a nuclear stress test is safe for most people. In rare cases, it may cause an allergic reaction. Also, a nuclear stress test is not recommended for pregnant women, as the dye might be harmful to an unborn baby.
","What do the results mean?A normal test result means no blood flow problems were found. If your test result was not normal, it can mean there is reduced blood flow to your heart. Reasons for reduced blood flow include:Coronary artery diseaseScarring from a previous heart attackYour current heart treatment is not working wellPoor physical fitnessIf your exercise stress test results were not normal, your health care provider may order a nuclear stress test or a stress echocardiogram. These tests are more accurate than exercise stress tests, but also more expensive. If these imaging tests show a problem with your heart, your provider may recommend more tests and/or treatment.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.

suicide risk screening,"What is a suicide risk screening?
Every year nearly 800,000 people around the world take their own lives. Many more attempt suicide. In the United States, it's the 10th leading cause of death overall, and the second leading cause of death in people aged 10-34. Suicide has a lasting impact on those left behind and on the community at large.
Although suicide is a major health problem, it can often be prevented. A suicide risk screening can help find out how likely it is that someone will try to take their own life. During most screenings, a provider will ask some questions about behavior and feelings. There are specific questions and guidelines that providers can use. These are known as suicide risk assessment tools. If you or a loved one is found to be at risk for suicide, you can get medical, psychological, and emotional support that may help avoid a tragic outcome.
Other names: suicide risk assessment
","What is it used for?
A suicide risk screening is used to find out if someone is at risk for trying to take their own life.
","Why do I need a suicide risk screening?
You or a loved one may need a suicide risk screening if you notice any of the following warning signs:

Feeling hopeless and/or trapped
Talking about being a burden to others
Increased use of alcohol or drugs
Having extreme mood swings
Withdrawing from social situations or wanting to be alone
A change in eating and/or sleeping habits

You may also need a screening if you have certain risk factors. You may be more likely to try to harm yourself if you have:

Tried to kill yourself before
Depression or other mood disorder
A history of suicide in your family
A history of trauma or abuse
A chronic illness and/or chronic pain

A suicide risk screening can be very helpful for people with these warning signs and risk factors. Other warning signs may need to be addressed immediately. These include:

Talking about suicide or wanting to die
Searching online for ways to kill yourself, getting a gun, or stockpiling medicines such as sleeping pills or pain medicines
Talking about having no reason to live

If you or a loved one has any of these warning signs, seek help right away. Call 911 or
the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).
","What happens during a suicide risk screening?
A screening may be done by your primary care provider or a mental health provider. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems.
Your primary care provider may give you a physical exam and ask you about your use of drugs and alcohol, changes in eating and sleeping habits, and mood swings. These could have many different causes. He or she may ask you about any prescription drugs you are taking. In some cases, antidepressants can increase suicidal thoughts, especially in children, teenagers, and young adults (under the age of 25). You may also get a blood test or other tests to see if a physical disorder is causing your suicidal symptoms.
During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
Your primary care provider or a mental health provider may also use one or more suicide risk assessment tools. A suicide risk assessment tool is type of questionnaire or guideline for providers. These tools help providers evaluate your behavior, feelings, and suicidal thoughts. The most commonly used assessment tools include:

Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9). This tool is made up of nine questions about suicidal thoughts and behaviors.
Ask Suicide-Screening Questions. This includes four questions and is geared toward people aged 10-24.
SAFE-T. This is a test that focuses on five areas of suicide risk, as well as suggested treatment options.
The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). This is a suicide risk assessment scale that measures four different areas of suicide risk.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a suicide risk screening?
You don't need any special preparations for this screening.
","Are there any risks to screening?
There is no risk to having a physical exam or a questionnaire. There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
If the results of your physical exam or blood test show a physical disorder or a problem with a medicine, your provider may provide treatment and change or adjust your medicines as necessary.
The results of a suicide risk assessment tool or suicide risk assessment scale can show how likely it is you will attempt suicide. Your treatment will depend on your risk level. If you are at very high risk, you may be admitted to a hospital. If your risk is more moderate, your provider may recommend one or more of the following:

Psychological counseling from a mental health professional
Medicines, such as antidepressants. But younger people on antidepressants should be closely monitored. The medicines sometimes increase suicide risk in children and young adults.
Treatment for addiction to alcohol or drugs

sweat test for cystic fibrosis,"What is a sweat test?
A sweat test measures the amount of chloride, a part of salt, in Sweat. It is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF). People with CF have a high level of chloride in their sweat.
CF is a disease that causes mucus build-up in the lungs and other organs. It damages the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. It can also lead to frequent infections and malnutrition. CF is an inherited disease, which means it is passed down from your parents, through genes.
Genes are parts of DNA that carry information that determine your unique traits, such as height and eye color. Genes are also responsible for certain health problems. To have cystic fibrosis, you must have a CF gene from both your mother and your father. If only one parent has the gene, you will not get the disease.
Other names: sweat chloride test, cystic fibrosis sweat test, sweat electrolytes

","What is it used for?
A sweat test is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis.

","Why do I need a sweat test?
A sweat test can diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) in people of all ages, but it's usually done on babies. Your baby may need a sweat test if he or she tested positive for CF on a routine newborn blood test. In the United States, new babies are usually tested for a variety of conditions including CF. Most sweat tests are done when babies are 2 to 4 weeks old.
An older child or adult who has never been tested for CF may need a cystic fibrosis sweat test if someone in the family has the disease and/or has symptoms of CF. These include:

Salty-tasting skin
Frequent coughing
Frequent lung infections, such as pneumonia and bronchitis
Trouble breathing
Failure to gain weight, even with a good appetite
Greasy, bulky stools
In newborns, no stools made right after birth


","What happens during a sweat test?
Your health care provider will need to collect a sample of sweat for testing. The entire procedure will take about an hour and will probably include the following steps:

A health care provider will put pilocarpine, a medicine that causes sweating, on a small area of the forearm.
Your provider will place an electrode on this area.
A weak current will be sent through the electrode. This current makes the medicine seep into the skin. This may cause a little tingling or warmth.
After removing the electrode, your provider will tape a piece of filter paper or gauze on the forearm to collect the sweat.
Sweat will be collected for 30 minutes.
The collected sweat will be sent to a lab for testing.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a sweat test, but you should avoid applying any creams or lotions to the  skin for 24 hours before the procedure.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is no known risk to a sweat test. Your child may have a tingling or tickling sensation from the electric current, but should not feel any pain.

","What do the results mean?
If the results show a high level of chloride, there is a good chance your child has cystic fibrosis. Your health care provider will probably order another sweat test and/or other tests to confirm or rule out a diagnosis. If you have questions about your child's results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a sweat test?
While there is no cure for cystic fibrosis (CF), there are treatments available that help reduce symptoms and improve quality of life. If your child was diagnosed with CF, talk with your health care provider about strategies and treatments to help manage the disease.
"
synovial fluid analysis,"What is a synovial fluid analysis?
Synovial fluid, also known as joint fluid, is a thick liquid located between your joints. The fluid cushions the ends of bones and reduces friction when you move your joints. A synovial fluid analysis is a group of tests that checks for disorders that affect the joints. The tests usually include the following:

An exam of physical qualities of the fluid, such as its color and thickness
Chemical tests to check for changes in the fluid's chemicals
Microscopic analysis to look for crystals, bacteria, and other substances

Other names: joint fluid analysis
","What is it used for?
A synovial fluid analysis is used to help diagnose the cause of joint pain and inflammation. Inflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. It can cause pain, swelling, redness, and loss of function in the affected area. Causes of joint problems include:

Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis. It is a chronic, progressive disease that causes joint cartilage to break down. It can be painful and lead to loss of mobility and function.
Gout, a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in one or more joints, usually in the big toe
Rheumatoid arthritis, a condition in which the body's immune system attacks healthy cells in your joints
Joint effusion, a condition that happens when too much fluid builds up around a joint. It often affects the knee. When it affects the knee, it may be referred to as knee effusion or fluid on the knee.
Infection in a joint
Bleeding disorder, such as hemophilia. Hemophilia is an inherited disorder that can cause excessive bleeding. Sometimes the excess blood ends up in the synovial fluid.

","Why do I need a synovial fluid analysis?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of a joint disorder. These include:

Joint pain
Joint swelling
Redness at a joint
Joint that feels warm to the touch

","What happens during a synovial fluid analysis?
Your synovial fluid will be collected in a procedure called arthrocentesis, also known as joint aspiration. During the procedure:

A health care provider will clean the skin on and around the affected joint.
The provider will inject an anesthetic and/or apply a numbing cream to the skin, so you won't feel any pain during the procedure. If your child is getting the procedure, he or she may also be given a sedative. Sedatives are medicines that have a calming effect and help reduce anxiety.
Once the needle is in place, your provider will withdraw a sample of synovial fluid and collect it in the syringe of the needle.
Your provider will put a small bandage on the spot where the needle was inserted.

The procedure usually takes less than two minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if you need to fast and if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?
Your joint may be sore for a couple of days after the procedure. Serious complications, such as infection and bleeding may happen, but are uncommon.
","What do the results mean?
If your results show your synovial fluid was not normal, it may mean one of the following conditions:

A type of arthritis, such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout
Bleeding disorder
Bacterial infection

Your specific results will depend on what abnormalities were found. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a synovial fluid analysis?
Arthrocentesis, the procedure used to do a synovial fluid analysis, may also be done to remove excess fluid from a joint. Normally, there is only a small amount of synovial fluid between the joints. If you have a joint problem, extra fluid can build up, causing pain, stiffness, and inflammation. This procedure can help relieve pain and other symptoms.
"
syphilis tests,"What are syphilis tests?
Syphilis is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is a bacterial infection spread through vaginal, oral, or anal sex with an infected person. Syphilis develops in stages that can last for weeks, months, or even years. The stages may be separated by long periods of apparent good health.
Syphilis usually starts with a small, painless sore, called a chancre, on the genitals, anus, or mouth. In the next stage, you may have flu-like symptoms and/or a rash. Later stages of syphilis can damage the brain, heart, spinal cord, and other organs. Syphilis tests can help diagnose syphilis in the early stages of infection, when the disease is easiest to treat.
Other names: rapid plasma reagin (RPR), venereal disease Research laboratory (VDRL), fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, agglutination assay (TPPA), darkfield microscopy

","What are they used for?
Syphilis tests are used to screen for and diagnose syphilis.
Screening tests for syphilis include:

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR), a syphilis blood test that looks for antibodies to the syphilis bacteria. Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances, such as bacteria.
Venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, which also checks for syphilis antibodies. A VDRL test can be done on blood or spinal fluid.

If a screening test comes back positive, you will need more testing to rule out or confirm a syphilis diagnosis. Most of these follow up tests will also look for syphilis antibodies. Sometimes, a healthcare provider will use a test that looks for actual syphilis bacteria, instead of the antibodies. Tests that look for the actual bacteria are used less often because they can only be done in specialized labs by specially trained health care professionals.

","Why do I need a syphilis test?
You may need a syphilis test if your sexual partner has been diagnosed with syphilis and/or you have symptoms of the disease. Symptoms usually appear about two to three weeks after infection and include:

Small, painless sore (chancre) on the genitals, anus, or mouth
Rough, red rash, usually on the palms of the hands or the bottom of the feet
Fever
Headache
Swollen glands
Fatigue
Weight loss
Hair loss

Even if you don't have symptoms, you may need a test if you are at a higher risk of infection. Risk factors include having:

Multiple sex partners
A partner with multiple sex partners
Unprotected sex (sex without using a condom)
An HIV/AIDS infection
Another sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea

You may also need this test if you are pregnant. Syphilis can be passed from a mother to her unborn baby. A syphilis infection can cause serious, and sometimes deadly, complications to infants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all pregnant women get tested early in pregnancy. Women who have risk factors for syphilis should be tested again in the third trimester of pregnancy (28–32 weeks) and again at delivery.

","What happens during a syphilis test?
A syphilis test is usually in the form of a blood test. During a syphilis blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
More advanced stages of syphilis can affect the brain and spinal cord. If your symptoms show your disease might be in a more advanced stage, your health care provider may order a syphilis test on your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear liquid found in your brain and spinal cord.
For this test, your CSF will be collected through a procedure called a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. During the procedure:

You will lie on your side or sit on an exam table.
A health care provider will clean your back and inject an anesthetic into your skin, so you  won't feel pain during the procedure. Your provider may put a numbing cream on your back before this injection.
Once the area on your back is completely numb, your provider will insert a thin, hollow needle between two vertebrae in your lower spine. Vertebrae are the small backbones that make up your spine.
Your provider will withdraw a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. This will take about five minutes.
You'll need to stay very still while the fluid is being withdrawn.
Your provider may ask you to lie on your back for an hour or two after the procedure. This may prevent you from getting a headache afterward.


","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a syphilis blood test. For a lumbar puncture, you may be asked to empty your bladder and bowels before the test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
If you had a lumbar puncture, you may have pain or tenderness in your back where the needle was inserted. You may also get a headache after the procedure.

","What do the results mean?
If your screening results were negative or normal, it means no syphilis infection was found. Since antibodies can take a couple of weeks to develop in response to a bacterial infection, you may need another screening test if you think you were exposed to the infection. Ask your health care provider about when or if you need to be re-tested.
If your screening tests show a positive result, you will have more testing to rule out or confirm a syphilis diagnosis. If these tests confirm you have syphilis, you will probably be treated with penicillin, a type of antibiotic. Most early-stage syphilis infections are completely cured after antibiotic treatment. Later-stage syphilis is also treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment for later-stage infections can stop the disease from getting worse, but it can't undo damage already done.
If you have questions about your results, or about syphilis, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about syphilis tests?
If you are diagnosed with syphilis, you need to tell your sexual partner, so he or she can get tested and treated if necessary.
"
testosterone levels test,"What is a testosterone levels test?
Testosterone is the main sex hormone in males. During a boy's puberty, testosterone causes the growth of body hair, muscle development, and deepening of the voice. In adult men, it controls sex drive, maintains muscle mass, and helps make sperm. Women also have testosterone in their bodies, but in much smaller amounts.
This test measures the levels of testosterone in your blood. Most of the testosterone in the blood is attached to proteins. Testosterone that is not attached to a protein is called free testosterone. There are two main types of testosterone tests:

Total testosterone, which measures both attached and free testosterone.
Free testosterone, which measures just free testosterone. Free testosterone can give more information about certain medical conditions.

Testosterone levels that are too low (low T) or too high (high T) can cause health problems in both men and women.
Other names: serum testosterone, total testosterone, free testosterone, bioavailable testosterone

","What is it used for?
A testosterone levels test may be used to diagnose several conditions, including:

Decreased sex drive in men and women
Infertility in men and women
Erectile dysfunction in men
Tumors of testicles in men
Early or delayed puberty in boys
Excess body hair growth and development of masculine features in women
Irregular menstrual periods in women


","Why do I need a testosterone levels test?
You may need this test if you have symptoms of abnormal testosterone levels. For adult men, it's mostly ordered if there are symptoms of low T levels. For women, it's mostly ordered if there are symptoms of high T levels.
Symptoms of low T levels in men include:

Low sex drive
Difficulty getting an erection
Development of breast tissue
Fertility problems
Hair loss
Weak bones
Loss of muscle mass

Symptoms of high T levels in women include:

Boys may also need a testosterone levels test. In boys, delayed puberty can be a symptom of low T , while early puberty may be a symptom of high T.

","What happens during a testosterone levels test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a testosterone levels test.

","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.

","What do the results mean?
Results mean different things depending on whether you are a man, woman, or boy.
For men:

High T levels may mean a tumor in the testicles or adrenal glands. Adrenal glands are located above the kidneys and help control heart rate, blood pressure, and other bodily functions.
Low T levels may mean a genetic or chronic disease, or a problem with the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small organ in the brain that controls many functions, including growth and fertility.

For women:

High T levels may indicate a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common hormone disorder affecting women of childbearing age. It is one of the leading causes of female infertility.
It may also mean cancer of the ovaries or adrenal glands.
Low T levels are normal, but extremely low levels may indicate Addison disease, a disorder of the pituitary gland.

For boys:

High T levels may mean cancer in the testicles or adrenal glands.
Low T levels in boys may mean there is some other problem with the testicles, including an injury.

If your results are not normal, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a medical condition needing treatment. Certain medicines, as well as alcoholism, can affect your results. If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a testosterone levels test?
Men who are diagnosed with low T levels may benefit from testosterone supplements, as prescribed by their health care provider. Testosterone supplements are not recommended for men with normal T levels. There is no proof they provide any benefits, and in fact they may be harmful to healthy men.

therapeutic drug monitoring,"What is therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM)?
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is testing that measures the amount of certain medicines in your blood. It is done to make sure the amount of medicine you are taking is both safe and effective.
Most medicines can be dosed correctly without special testing. But for certain types of medicines, it can be hard to figure out a dose that provides enough medicine to treat your condition without causing dangerous side effects. TDM helps your provider find out if you are taking the right dose of your medicine.
Other names: medicine levels blood test, therapeutic drug levels
","What is it used for?
Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is used to determine the best dosages for people taking certain types of hard-to-dose medicines. Below are some of the most common medicines that should be monitored.

Types of Medicine
Medicine Names

Antibiotics
vancomycin, gentamycin, amakacin
Heart drugs
digoxin, procainamide, lidocaine
Anti-seizure drugs
phenytoin, phenobarbital
Drugs treat autoimmune diseases
cyclosporine, tacrolimus
Drugs that treat bipolar disorder
lithium, valproic acid


","Why do I need TDM?
You may need testing when you first start taking a medicine. This helps your provider figure out the most effective dose for you. Once that dose is determined, you may be tested regularly to make sure the medicine is still effective without being harmful. You may also need testing if you have symptoms of a serious side effect. Side effects vary depending on the medicine. Your health care provider will let you know which symptoms to watch out for.
","What happens during TDM?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
Depending on the type of medicine you are taking, you may need to schedule your test for before or after you take your regular dose.
","Are there any risks to TDM?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
Your results will show if medicine levels in your blood are in a range that is medically helpful but not dangerous. This is called the therapeutic range. The range varies depending on the type of medicine and your own health needs. If your results are not in this range, your provider may need to adjust your dosages. If your dosages are changed, you may get repeated tests until your medicine levels fall into the therapeutic range.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.

thyroglobulin,"What is a thyroglobulin test?This test measures the level of thyroglobulin in your blood. Thyroglobulin is a protein made by cells in the thyroid. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. A thyroglobulin test is mostly used as a tumor marker test to help guide thyroid cancer treatment.Tumor markers, sometimes called cancer markers, are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body. Thyroglobulin is made by both normal and cancerous thyroid cells.The main goal of thyroid cancer treatment is to get rid of all thyroid cells. It usually involves removing the thyroid gland through surgery, followed by therapy with radioactive iodine (radioiodine). Radioiodine is a medicine used to destroy any thyroid cells that are left after surgery. It is most often given as a liquid or in a capsule.After treatment, there should be little to no thyroglobulin in the blood. Measuring thyroglobulin levels can show whether thyroid cancer cells are still in the body after treatment.Other names: Tg, TGB. thyroglobulin tumor marker
","What is it used for?A thyroglobulin test is mostly used to:See if thyroid cancer treatment was successful. If thyroglobulin levels stay the same or increase after treatment, it may mean there are still thyroid cancer cells in the body. If thyroglobulin levels decrease or disappear after treatment, it may mean there are no normal or cancerous thyroid cells left in the body.See if cancer has returned after successful treatment.A healthy thyroid will make thyroglobulin. So a thyroglobulin test is not used to diagnose thyroid cancer.
","Why do I need a thyroglobulin test?You will probably need this test after you've been treated for thyroid cancer. Your health care provider may test you regularly to see if any thyroid cells remain after treatment. You may be tested every few weeks or months, beginning shortly after treatment ends.

thyroid antibodies,"What is a thyroid antibodies test?This test measures the level of thyroid antibodies in your blood. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. Your thyroid makes hormones that regulate the way your body uses energy. It also plays an important role in regulating your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood.Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system to fight foreign substances like viruses and bacteria. But sometimes antibodies attack the body's own cells, tissues, and organs by mistake. This is known as an autoimmune response. When thyroid antibodies attack healthy thyroid cells, it can lead to an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid. These disorders can cause serious health problems if not treated.There are different types of thyroid antibodies. Some antibodies destroy thyroid tissue. Others cause the thyroid to make too much of certain thyroid hormones. A thyroid antibodies test usually measures one or more of the following types of antibodies:Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO). These antibodies can be a sign of:Hashimoto disease, also known as Hashimoto thyroiditis. This is an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid doesn't make enough thyroid hormones.Graves' disease. This is also an autoimmune disease and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid makes too much of certain thyroid hormones.Thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg). These antibodies can also be a sign of Hashimoto disease. Most people with Hashimoto disease have high levels of both Tg and TPO antibodies.Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor. These antibodies can be a sign of Grave's disease.Other names: thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid peroxidase antibody, TPO, Anti-TPO, thyroid- stimulating immunoglobulin, TSI
","What is it used for?A thyroid antibodies test is used to help diagnose autoimmune disorders of the thyroid.

tp53 genetic test,"What is a TP53 genetic test?A TP53 genetic test looks for a change, known as a mutation, in a gene called TP53 (tumor protein 53). Genes are the basic units of heredity passed down from your mother and father.TP53 is a gene that helps stop the growth of tumors. It's known as a tumor suppressor. A tumor suppressor gene works like the brakes on a car. It puts the ""brakes"" on cells, so they don't divide too quickly. If you have a TP53 mutation, the gene may not be able to control the growth of your cells. Uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.A TP53 mutation can be inherited from your parents, or acquired later in life from the environment or from a mistake that happens in your body during cell division.An inherited TP53 mutation is known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome.Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare genetic condition that can increase your risk of certain types of cancers.These cancers include breast cancer, bone cancer, leukemia, and soft tissue cancers, also called sarcomas.Acquired (also known as somatic) TP53 mutations are much more common. These mutations have been found in about half of all cases of cancer, and in many different types of cancer.Other names: TP53 mutation analysis, TP53 full gene analysis, TP53 somatic mutation
","What is it used for?The test is used to look for a TP53 mutation. It is not a routine test. It is usually given to people based on family history, symptoms, or previous diagnosis of cancer.

triglycerides test,"What is a triglycerides test?A triglycerides test measures the amount of triglycerides in your blood. Triglycerides are a type of fat in your body. If you eat more calories than you need, the extra calories are changed into triglycerides. These triglycerides are stored in your fat cells for later use. When your body needs energy, triglycerides are released into your bloodstream to provide fuel for your muscles to work. If you eat more calories than you burn off, especially calories from carbohydrates and fats, you may get high triglyceride levels in your blood. High triglycerides may put you at greater risk for a heart attack or stroke.Other names for a triglycerides test: TG, TRIG, lipid panel, fasting lipoprotein panel
","What is it used for?A triglycerides test is usually part of a lipid profile. Lipid is another word for fat. A lipid profile is a test that measures the level of fats in your blood, including triglycerides and cholesterol, a waxy, fatty substance found in every cell of your body.

triiodothyronine (t3) tests,"What is a triiodothyronine (T3) test?
This test measures the level of triiodothyronine (T3) in your blood. T3 is one of two major hormones made by your thyroid, a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near the throat. The other hormone is called thyroxine (T4.) T3 and T4 work together to regulate how your body uses energy. These hormones also play an important role in controlling your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and nervous system.
The T3 hormone comes in two forms:

Bound T3, which attaches to protein
Free T3, which does not attach to anything

A test that measures both bound and free T3 is called a total T3 test. Another test called free T3 just measures free T3. Either test may be used to check T3 levels. If T3 levels are not normal, it can be a sign of thyroid disease.

Other names: thyroid function test; total triiodothyronine, free triiodothyronine, FT3
","What is it used for?
A T3 test is most often used to diagnose hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the body makes too much thyroid hormone.
T3 tests are frequently ordered with T4 and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) tests. A T3 test may also be used to monitor treatment for thyroid disease.
","Why do I need a T3 test?
You may need a T3 test if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism. These include:

Anxiety
Weight loss
Tremors in the hands
Increased heart rate
Bulging of the eyes
Trouble sleeping
Fatigue
Low tolerance for heat
More frequent bowel movements

","What happens during a T3 test?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.

troponin test,"What is a troponin test?A troponin test measures the level of troponin in your blood. Troponin is a type of protein found in the muscles of your heart. Troponin isn't normally found in the blood. When heart muscles become damaged, troponin is sent into the bloodstream. As heart damage increases, greater amounts of troponin are released in the blood.High levels of troponin in the blood may mean you are having or recently had a heart attack. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart gets blocked. This blockage can be deadly. But quick diagnosis and treatment can save your life.Other names: cardiac troponin I (cTnI), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), cardiac troponin (cTN),
cardiac-specific troponin I and troponin T
","What is it used for?The test is most often used to diagnose a heart attack. It is sometimes used to monitor angina, a condition that limits blood flow to the heart and causes chest pain. Angina sometimes leads to a heart attack.
","Why do I need a troponin test?You may need this test if you have been admitted to the emergency room with symptoms of a heart attack. These symptoms include:Chest pain or discomfortPain in other parts of the body, including your arm, back, jaw, or neckTrouble breathingNausea and vomitingFatigueDizzinessSweatingAfter you are first tested, you will probably get retested two or more times over the next 24 hours. This is done to see if there are any changes in your troponin levels over time.
","What happens during a troponin test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a troponin test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?Normal troponin levels in the blood are usually so low, they can't be found on most blood tests. If your results show normal troponin levels for 12 hours after chest pain has started, it's unlikely that your symptoms were caused by a heart attack.If even a small level of troponin is found in your blood, it may mean there is some damage to your heart. If high levels of troponin are found in one or more tests over time, it probably means you had a heart attack. Other reasons for higher than normal troponin levels include:Congestive heart failureKidney diseaseBlood clot in your lungsIf you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a troponin test?If you have symptoms of a heart attack at home or elsewhere, call 911 immediately. Quick medical attention could save your life.
"
tsh (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test,"What is a TSH test?TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone. A TSH test is a blood test that measures this hormone. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located near your throat. Your thyroid makes hormones that regulate the way your body uses energy. It also plays an important role in regulating your weight, body temperature, muscle strength, and even your mood. TSH is made in a gland in the brain called the pituitary. When thyroid levels in your body are low, the pituitary gland makes more TSH. When thyroid levels are high, the pituitary gland makes less TSH. TSH levels that are too high or too low can indicate your thyroid isn't working correctly.Other names: thyrotropin test
","What is it used for?A TSH test is used to find out how well the thyroid is working.
","Why do I need a TSH test?You may need a TSH test if you have symptoms of too much thyroid hormone in your blood (hyperthyroidism), or too little thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism).Symptoms of hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid, include:AnxietyWeight lossTremors in the handsIncreased heart ratePuffinessBulging of the eyesDifficulty sleepingSymptoms of hypothyroidism, also known as underactive thyroid, include:Weight gainTirednessHair lossLow tolerance for cold temperaturesIrregular menstrual periodsConstipation
","What happens during a TSH test?A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for a TSH blood test. If your health care provider has ordered other blood tests, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?High TSH levels can mean your thyroid is not making enough thyroid hormones, a condition called hypothyroidism. Low TSH levels can mean your thyroid is making too much of the hormones, a condition called hyperthyroidism. A TSH test does not explain why TSH levels are too high or too low. If your test results are abnormal, your health care provider will probably order additional tests to determine the cause of your thyroid problem. These tests may include:T4 thyroid hormone testsT3 thyroid hormone testsTests to diagnose Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that causes hyperthyroidismTests to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disease that causes hypothyroidismLearn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a TSH test?Thyroid changes can happen during pregnancy. These changes are usually not significant, but some women can develop thyroid disease during pregnancy. Hyperthyroidism occurs in about one in every 500 pregnancies, while hypothyroidism occurs in approximately one in every 250 pregnancies. Hyperthyroidism, and less often, hypothyroidism, may remain after pregnancy. If you develop a thyroid condition during pregnancy, your health care provider will monitor your condition after your baby is born. If you have a history of thyroid disease, be sure to talk with your health care provider if you are pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant.
"
tuberculosis screening,"What is a tuberculosis (TB) screening?This test checks to see if you have been infected with tuberculosis, commonly known as TB. TB is a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. It can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain, spine, and kidneys. TB is spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing.Not everyone infected with TB gets sick. Some people have an inactive form of the infection called latent TB. When you have latent TB, you don't feel sick and can't spread the disease to others.Many people with latent TB will never feel any symptoms of the disease. But for others, especially those who have or develop weakened immune systems, latent TB can turn into a far more dangerous infection called active TB. If you have active TB, you may feel very sick. You may also spread the disease to other people. Without treatment, active TB can cause serious illness or even death.There are two types of TB tests used for screening: a TB skin test and a TB blood test. These tests can show if you have ever been infected with TB. They don't show if you have a latent or active TB infection. More tests will be needed to confirm or rule out a diagnosis.Other names: TB test, TB skin test, PPD test, IGRA test
","What is it used for?TB screening is used to look for a TB infection in a skin or blood sample. The screening can show whether you have been infected with TB. It does not show if TB is latent or active.
","Why do I need a TB screening?You may need a TB skin test or TB blood test if you have symptoms of an active TB infection or if you have certain factors that put you at higher risk for getting TB.Symptoms of an active TB infection include:Cough that lasts for three weeks or moreCoughing up bloodChest painFeverFatigueNight sweatsUnexplained weight lossIn addition, some childcare centers and other facilities require TB testing for employment.You may be at higher risk for getting TB if you:Are a health care worker who cares for patients who have or are at high risk for getting TBLive or work in a place with a high rate of TB infection. These include homeless shelters, nursing homes, and prisons.Have been exposed to someone who has an active TB infectionHave HIV or another disease that weakens your immune systemUse illegal drugsHave traveled or lived in an area where TB is more common. These include countries in Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and in Russia.
","What happens during a TB screening?A TB screening will either be a TB skin test or a TB blood test. TB skin tests are used more often, but blood tests for TB are becoming more common. Your health care provider will recommend which type of TB test is best for you.For a TB skin test (also called a PPD test), you will need two visits to your health care provider's office. On the first visit, your provider will:Wipe your inner arm with an antiseptic solutionUse a tiny needle to inject a small amount of PPD under the first layer of skin. PPD is a protein that comes from the tuberculosis bacteria. It is not live bacteria, and it will not make you sick.A small bump will form on your forearm. It should go away in a few hours.Be sure to leave the site uncovered and undisturbed.After 48-72 hours, you will return to your provider's office. During this visit, your provider will check the injection site for a reaction that may indicate a TB infection. This includes swelling, redness, and an increase in size.For a TB test in blood (also called an IGRA test), a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?You don't need any special preparations for TB skin test or a TB blood test.
","Are there any risks to the test?There is very little risk to having a TB skin test or blood test. For a TB skin test, you may feel a pinch when you get the injection.For a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?If your TB skin test or blood test shows a possible TB infection, your health care provider will probably order more tests to help make a diagnosis. You may also need further testing if your results were negative, but you have symptoms of TB and/or have certain risk factors for TB. Tests that diagnose TB include chest x-rays and tests on a sputum sample. Sputum is a thick mucous coughed up from the lungs. It is different than spit or saliva.If not treated, TB can be deadly. But most cases of TB can be cured if you take antibiotics as directed by your health care provider. Both active and latent TB should be treated, because latent TB can turn into active TB and become dangerous.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a TB screening?Treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections. After a few weeks on antibiotics, you will no longer be contagious, but you will still have TB. To cure TB, you need to take antibiotics for at least six to nine months. The length of time depends on your overall health, age, and other factors. It's important to take the antibiotics for as long as your provider tells you, even if you feel better. Stopping early can cause the infection to come back.
"
tumor marker tests,"What are tumor marker tests?
These tests look for tumor markers, sometimes called cancer markers, in the blood, urine, or body tissues. Tumor markers are substances made by cancer cells or by normal cells in response to cancer in the body. Some tumor markers are specific to one type of cancer. Others can be found in several types of cancers.
Because tumor markers can also show up in certain noncancerous conditions, tumor marker tests are not usually used to diagnose cancer or screen people at low risk of the disease. These tests are most often done on people already diagnosed with cancer. Tumor markers can help find out if your cancer has spread, whether your treatment is working, or if your cancer has come back after you've finished treatment.

","What are they used for?
Tumor marker tests are most often used to:

Plan your treatment. If tumor marker levels go down, it usually means the treatment is working.
Help find out if a cancer has spread to other tissues
Help predict the likely outcome or course of your disease
Check to see if your cancer has come back after successful treatment
Screen people at high risk for cancer. Risk factors can include family history and previous diagnosis of another type of cancer


","Why do I need a tumor marker test?
You may need a tumor marker test if you are currently being treated for cancer, have finished cancer treatment, or have a high risk of getting cancer because of family history or other reasons.
The type of test you get will depend on your health, health history, and symptoms you may have. Below are some of the most common types of tumor markers and what they are used for.





CA 125 (cancer antigen 125)




Tumor marker for:
ovarian cancer


Used to:


See if cancer treatment is working
See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment











CA 15-3 and CA 27-29 (cancer antigens 15-3 and 27-29)




Tumor markers for:
breast cancer


Used to:
Monitor treatment in women with advanced breast cancer









PSA (prostate-specific antigen)




Tumor marker for:
prostate cancer


Used to:


Screen for prostate cancer

CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen)




Tumor marker for:
colorectal cancer, and also for cancers of the lung, stomach, thyroid, pancreas, breast, and ovary


Used to:


See if cancer treatment is working
See if cancer has come back after you've finished treatment











AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein)




Tumor marker for:
liver cancer, and cancers of the ovary or testicles


Used to:


Help diagnose liver cancer
Find out if cancer has spread (the stage of cancer)
See if cancer treatment is working
Predict chances for recovery











B2M (Beta 2-microglobulin)




Tumor marker for:
multiple myeloma, some lymphomas, and leukemias


Used to:


See if cancer treatment is working
Predict chances for recovery









","What happens during a tumor marker test?
There are different ways to test for tumor markers. Blood tests are the most common type of tumor marker tests. Urine tests or biopsies may also be used to check for tumor markers. A biopsy is a minor procedure that involves removing a small piece of tissue for testing.
If you are getting a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes.
If you are getting a urine test, ask your health care provider for instructions on how to provide your sample.
If you are getting a biopsy, a health care provider will take out a small piece of tissue by cutting or scraping the skin. If your provider needs to test tissue from inside your body, he or she may use a special needle to withdraw the sample.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You usually don't need any special preparations for a blood or urine test. If you are getting a biopsy, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the procedure. Talk to your health care provider if you have any questions about preparing for your test.
","Are there any risks to the test?
There is very little risk to having a blood test. You may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
There is no risk to a urine test.
If you have had a biopsy, you may have a little bruising or bleeding at biopsy site. You may also have a little discomfort at the site for a day or two.

","What do the results mean?
Depending in what type of test you had and how it was used, your results may:

Help diagnose the type or stage of your cancer.
Show whether your cancer treatment is working.
Help plan future treatment.
Show if your cancer has returned after you've finished treatment.

If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about tumor marker tests?
Tumor markers can be very useful, but the information they provide can be limited because:

Some noncancerous conditions can cause tumor markers.
Some people with cancer don't have tumor markers.
Not all types of cancer have tumor markers.

So, tumor markers are almost always used with other tests to help diagnose and monitor cancer.
"
uric acid test,"What is a uric acid test?This test measures the amount of uric acid in your blood or urine. Uric acid is a normal waste product that's made when the body breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines are substances found in your own cells and also in some foods. Foods with high levels of purines include liver, anchovies, sardines, dried beans, and beer.Most uric acid dissolves in your blood, then goes to the kidneys. From there, it leaves the body through your urine. If your body makes too much uric acid or doesn't release enough into your urine, it can make crystals that form in your joints. This condition is known as gout. Gout is a form of arthritis that causes painful inflammation in and around the joints. High uric acid levels can also cause other disorders, including kidney stones and kidney failure.Other names: serum urate, uric acid: serum and urine
","What is it used for?A uric acid test is most often used to:Help diagnose goutHelp find the cause of frequent kidney stonesMonitor the uric acid level of people undergoing certain cancer treatments. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can cause high levels of uric acid to go into the blood.

"
urobilinogen in urine,"What is a urobilinogen in urine test?A urobilinogen in urine test measures the amount of urobilinogen in a urine sample. Urobilinogen is formed from the reduction of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellowish substance found in your liver that helps break down red blood cells. Normal urine contains some urobilinogen. If there is little or no urobilinogen in urine, it can mean your liver isn't working correctly. Too much urobilinogen in urine can indicate a liver disease such as hepatitis or cirrhosis.Other names: urine test; urine analysis; UA, chemical urinalysis
","What is it used for?A urobilinogen test may part of a urinalysis, a test that measures different cells, chemicals, and other substances in your urine. A urinalysis is often part of a routine exam.

"
videonystagmography (vng),"What is videonystagmography (VNG)?Videonystagmography (VNG) is a test that measures a type of involuntary eye movement called nystagmus. These movements can be slow or fast, steady or jerky. Nystagmus causes your eyes to move from side to side or up and down, or both. It happens when the brain gets conflicting messages from your eyes and the balance system in the inner ear. These conflicting messages can cause dizziness.You can briefly get nystagmus when you move your head a certain way or look at some types of patterns. But if you get it when you don't move your head or if it lasts a long time, it may mean you have a disorder of the vestibular system.Your vestibular system includes organs, nerves, and structures that are in your inner ear. It is your body's main center of balance. The vestibular system works together with your eyes, sense of touch, and brain. Your brain communicates with the different systems in your body to control your balance.Other names: VNG
","What is it used for?VNG is used to find out if you have a disorder of the vestibular system (the balance structures in your inner ear) or in the part of the brain that controls balance.
","Why do I need a VNG?You may need a VNG if you have symptoms of a vestibular disorder. The main symptom is dizziness, a general term for different symptoms of imbalance. These include vertigo, a feeling that you or your surroundings are spinning, staggering while walking, and lightheadedness, a feeling like you are going to faint.Other symptoms of a vestibular disorder include:Nystagmus (involuntary eye movements that go side to side or up and down)Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)Feeling of fullness or pressure in the earConfusion
","What happens during a VNG?A VNG may be done by a primary health care provider or one of the following types of specialists:An audiologist, a health care provider who specializes in diagnosing, treating, and managing hearing lossAn otolaryngologist (ENT), a doctor specializing in treating diseases and conditions of the ears, nose, and throatA neurologist, a doctor specializing in diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain and nervous systemDuring a VNG test, you will sit in a dark room and wear special goggles. The goggles have a camera that records eye movements. There are three main parts to a VNG:Ocular testing. During this part of the VNG, you will watch and follow moving and nonmoving dots on a light bar.Positional testing. During this part, your provider will move your head and body in different positions. Your provider will check if this movement causes nystagmus.Caloric testing. During this part, warm and cool water or air will be put in each ear. When cold water or air enters the inner ear, it should cause nystagmus. The eyes should then move away from the cold water in that ear and slowly back. When warm water or air is put in the ear, the eyes should move slowly toward that ear and slowly back. If the eyes don't respond in these ways, it may mean there is damage to the nerves of the inner ear. Your provider will also check to see if one ear responds differently from the other. If one ear is damaged, the response will be weaker than the other, or there may be no response at all.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a VNG?You may need to make changes in your diet or avoid certain medicines for a day or two before your test. Your health care provider will let you know if there are any special instructions to follow.
","Are there any risks to a VNG?The test may make you feel dizzy for a few minutes. You may want to make arrangements for someone to drive you home, in case the dizziness lasts for a longer period of time.
","What do the results mean?If the results were not normal, it may mean you have a disorder of the inner ear. These include:Meniere's disease, a disorder that causes dizziness, bouts of hearing loss, and tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It usually affects only one ear. Although there is no cure for Meniere's disease, the disorder may be managed with medicine and/or changes in your diet.Labyrinthitis, a disorder that causes vertigo and imbalance. It is caused when part of the inner ear becomes infected or swollen. The disorder sometimes goes away on its own, but you may be prescribed antibiotics if you are diagnosed with an infection.An abnormal result may also mean you have a condition that affects the parts of the brain that helps control your balance.If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a VNG?Another test called electronystagmography (ENG) measures the same type of eye movements as a VNG. It also uses ocular, positional, and caloric testing. But instead of using a camera to record eye movements, an ENG measures eye movements with electrodes placed on the skin around the eyes.While ENG testing is still being used, VNG testing is now more common. Unlike an ENG, a VNG can measure and record eye movements in real time. VNGs can also provide clearer pictures of eye movements.
"
vision screening,"What is vision screening?A vision screening, also called an eye test, is a brief exam that looks for potential vision problems and eye disorders. Vision screenings are often done by primary care providers as part of a child's regular checkup. Sometimes screenings are given to children by school nurses.Vision screening is not used to diagnose vision problems. If a problem is found on a vision screening, your or your child's provider will refer you to an eye care specialist for diagnosis and treatment. This specialist will do a more thorough eye test. Many vision problems and disorders can be successfully treated with corrective lenses, minor surgery, or other therapies.Other names: eye test, vision test
","What is it used for?Vision screening is most often used to check for possible vision problems in children. The most common eye disorders in children include:Amblyopia, also known as lazy eye. Children with amblyopia have blurry or reduced vision in one eye.Strabismus, also known as crossed eyes. In this disorder, the eyes don't line up right and point in different directions.Both of these disorders can be easily treated when found early.Vision screening is also used to help find the following vision problems, which affect both children and adults:Nearsightedness (myopia), a condition that makes far away things look blurryFarsightedness (hyperopia), a condition that makes close-up things look blurryAstigmatism, a condition that makes both close-up and far-away things look blurry
","Why do I need vision screening?A routine vision screening is not recommended for most healthy adults. But most adults are encouraged to get eye exams from an eye care specialist on a regular basis. If you have questions about when to get an eye exam, talk to your primary care provider.Children should be screened on a regular basis. The American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend the following vision screening schedule:Newborns. All new babies should be checked for eye infections or other disorders.6 months. Eyes and vision should be checked during a regular well-baby visit.1–4 years. Eyes and vision should be checked during routine visits.5 years and older. Eyes and vision should be checked every year.You may need to get your child screened if he or she has symptoms of an eye disorder. For infants three months or older, symptoms include:Not being able to make steady eye contactEyes that don't look properly alignedFor older children, symptoms include:Eyes that don't look properly lined upSquintingClosing or covering one eyeTrouble reading and/or doing close-up workComplaints that things are blurryBlinking more than usualWatery eyesDroopy eyelidsRedness in one or both eyesSensitivity to lightIf you are an adult with vision problems or other eye symptoms, you will probably be referred to an eye care specialist for a comprehensive eye test.
","What happens during vision screening?There are several types of visual screening tests. They include:Distance vision test. School-age children and adults are usually tested with a wall chart. The chart has several rows of letters. The letters on the top row are the biggest. The letters on the bottom are the smallest. You or your child will stand or sit 20 feet from the chart. He or she will be asked to cover one eye and read the letters, one row at a time. Each eye is tested separately.Distance vision test for preschoolers. For children too young to read, this test uses a wall chart similar to the one for older children and adults. But instead of rows of different letters, it only has the letter E in different positions. Your child will be asked to point in the same direction as the E. Some of these charts use the letter C, or use pictures, instead.Close-up vision test. For this test, you or your child will be given a small card with written text. The lines of text get smaller as you go farther down the card. You or your child will be asked to hold the card about 14 inches away from the face, and read aloud.

white blood cell (wbc) in stool,"What is a white blood cell (WBC) in stool test?
This test looks for white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, in your stool. White blood cells are part of the immune system. They help your body fight off infections and other diseases. If you have leukocytes in your stool, it can be a sign of a bacterial infection that affects the digestive system. These include:

Clostridium difficile (C. diff), an infection that most often happens after someone takes antibiotics. Some people with C. diff could develop life-threatening inflammation of the large intestine. It mostly affects older adults.
Shigellosis, an infection of the lining of the intestine. It is spread by direct contact with the bacteria in the stool. This can happen if an infected person doesn't wash their hands after using the bathroom. The bacteria can then be passed in food or water that this person handles. It mostly affects children under the age of 5.
Salmonella, a bacteria mostly found in undercooked meat, poultry, dairy, and seafood, and inside eggs. You can get the disease if you eat contaminated food.
Campylobacter, a bacteria found in raw or undercooked chicken. It can also be found in unpasteurized milk and contaminated water. You can get the disease by eating or drinking contaminated food.

Leukocytes in stool can also be a sign of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD is a type of chronic disorder that causes inflammation in the digestive system. Common types of IBD include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
Both IBD and bacterial infections of the digestive system can cause severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dehydration, a condition in which your body doesn't have enough water or other fluids to function normally. In some cases, these symptoms can be life-threatening.
Other names: leukocytes in stool, stool WBC, fecal leukocyte test, FLT
","What is it used for?A white blood cell in stool test is most often used to find out the cause of severe diarrhea that's lasted for more than four days.

"
white blood count (wbc),"What is a white blood count (WBC)?
A white blood count measures the number of white cells in your blood. White blood cells are part of the immune system. They help your body fight off infections and other diseases.
When you get sick, your body makes more white blood cells to fight the bacteria, viruses, or other foreign substances causing your illness. This increases your white blood count.
 Other diseases can cause your body to make fewer white blood cells than you need. This lowers your white blood count. Diseases that can lower your white blood count include some types of cancer and HIV/AIDS, a viral disease that attacks white blood cells. Certain medicines, including chemotherapy, may also lower the number of your white blood cells.
There are five major types of white blood cells:

Neutrophils
Lymphocytes
Monocytes
Eosinophils
Basophils

A white blood count measures the total number of these cells in your blood. Another test, called a blood differential, measures the amount of each type of white blood cell.
Other names: WBC count, white cell count, white blood cell count
","What is it used for?
A white blood count is most often used to help diagnose disorders related to having a high white blood cell count or low white blood cell count.
Disorders related to having a high white blood count include:

Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, conditions that cause the immune system to attack healthy tissues
Bacterial or viral infections
Cancers such as leukemia and Hodgkin disease
Allergic reactions

Disorders related to having a low white blood count include:

Diseases of the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS
Lymphoma, a cancer of the bone marrow
Diseases of the liver or spleen

A white blood count can show if the number of your white blood cells is too high or too low, but it can't confirm a diagnosis. So it is usually done along with other tests, such as a complete blood count, blood differential, blood smear, and/or bone marrow test.
","Why do I need a white blood count?
You may need this test if you have signs of an infection, inflammation, or autoimmune disease. Symptoms of infection include:

Fever
Chills
Body aches
Headache

Symptoms of inflammation and autoimmune diseases will be different, depending on the area of inflammation and type of disease.
You may also need this test if you have a disease that weakens your immune system or are taking medicine that lowers your immune response. If the test shows your white blood count is getting too low, your provider may be able to adjust your treatment.
Your newborn or older child may also be tested as part of a routine screening, or if they have symptoms of a white blood cell disorder.
","What happens during a white blood count?
A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out.
To test children, a health care provider will take a sample from the heel (newborns and young babies) or the fingertip (older babies and children). The provider will clean the heel or fingertip with alcohol and poke the site with a small needle. The provider will collect a few drops of blood and put a bandage on the site.
","Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test?
You don't need any special preparations for a white blood count.
","Are there any risks to the test?
After a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.
There is very little risk to your baby or child with a needle stick test. Your child may feel a little pinch when the site is poked, and a small bruise may form at the site. This should go away quickly.
","What do the results mean?
A high white blood count may mean you have one of the following conditions:

A bacterial or viral infection
An inflammatory disease such as rheumatoid arthritis
An allergy
Leukemia or Hodgkin disease
Tissue damage from a burn injury or surgery

A low white blood count may mean you have one of the following conditions:

Bone marrow damage. This may be caused by infection, disease, or treatments such as chemotherapy.
Cancers that affect the bone marrow
An autoimmune disorder, such as lupus (or SLE)
HIV/AIDS

If you are already being treated for a white blood cell disorder, your results may show if your treatment is working or whether your condition has improved.
If you have questions about your results, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about a white blood count?
White blood count results are often compared with results of other blood tests, including a blood differential. A blood differential test shows the amount of each type of white blood cell, such as neutrophils or lymphocytes. Neutrophils mostly target bacterial infections. Lymphocytes mostly target viral infections.

A higher than normal amount of neutrophils is known as neutrophilia.
A lower than normal amount is known as neutropenia.
A higher than normal amount of lymphocytes is known as lymphocytosis.
A lower normal amount is known as lymphopenia.

whooping cough diagnosis,"What is a whooping cough test?
Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a bacterial infection that causes severe fits of coughing and trouble breathing. People with whooping cough sometimes make a ""whooping"" sound as they try to take a breath. Whooping cough is very contagious. It is spread from person to person by coughing or sneezing.
You can get whooping cough at any age, but it mostly affects children. It's especially serious, and sometimes deadly, for babies less than a year old. A whooping cough test can help diagnose the disease. If your child gets a whooping cough diagnosis, he or she may be able to get treatment to prevent severe complications.
The best way to protect against whooping cough is with vaccination.
Other names: pertussis test, bordetella pertussis culture, PCR, antibodies (IgA, IgG, IgM)

","What is the test used for?
A whooping cough test is used to find out whether you or your child has whooping cough. Getting diagnosed and treated in the early stages of infection may make your symptoms less severe and help prevent the spread of the disease.

","Why do I need a whooping cough test?
Your health care provider may order a whooping cough test if you or your child has symptoms of whooping cough. You or your child may also need a test if you've been exposed to someone who has whooping cough.
Symptoms of whooping cough usually occur in three stages. In the first stage, symptoms are like those of a common cold and may include:

Runny nose
Watery eyes
Mild fever
Mild cough

It's better to get tested in the first stage, when the infection is most treatable.
In the second stage, the symptoms are more serious and may include:

Severe coughing that's hard to control
Trouble catching your breath when coughing, which may cause a ""whooping"" sound
Coughing so hard it causes vomiting

In the second stage, infants may not cough at all. But they may struggle to breathe or may even stop breathing at times.
In the third stage, you will start to feel better. You may still be coughing, but it will probably be less often and less severe.

","What happens during a whooping cough test?
There are different ways to test for whooping cough. Your health care provider may choose one of the following ways to make a whooping cough diagnosis.

Nasal aspirate. Your health care provider will inject a saline solution into your nose, then remove the sample with gentle suction.
Swab test. Your health care provider will use a special swab to take a sample from your nose or throat.
A blood test. During a blood test, a health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Blood tests are used more often in later stages of whooping cough.

In addition, your health care provider may order an x-ray to check for inflammation or fluid in the lungs.

","Will I need to do anything to prepare for a whooping cough test?
You don't need any special preparations for a whooping cough test.

","Are there any risks to the tests?
There is very little risk to whooping cough tests.

The nasal aspirate may feel uncomfortable. These effects are temporary.
For a swab test, you may feel a gagging sensation or even a tickle when your throat or nose is swabbed.
For a blood test, you may have slight pain or bruising at the spot where the needle was put in, but most symptoms go away quickly.


","What do the results mean?
A positive result probably means you or your child has whooping cough. A negative result doesn't completely rule out whooping cough. If your results are negative, your health care provider will probably order more tests to confirm or rule out a whooping cough diagnosis.
Whooping cough is treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics can make your infection less serious if you start treatment before your cough gets really bad. Treatment may also help prevent you from spreading the disease to others.
If you have questions about your test results or treatment, talk to your health care provider.
Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results.
","Is there anything else I need to know about whooping cough tests?
The best way to protect against whooping cough is with vaccination. Before whooping cough vaccines became available in the 1940s, thousands of children in the United States died from the disease every year. Today, deaths from whooping cough are rare, but as many as 40,000 Americans get sick with it every year. Most cases of whooping cough affect babies too young to be vaccinated or teens and adults who are not vaccinated or up to date on their vaccines.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination for all babies and children, teens, pregnant women, and adults who have not been vaccinated or are not up to date on their vaccines. Check with your health care provider to see if you or child needs to be vaccinated.

zika virus test,"What is a Zika virus test?
Zika is a viral infection usually spread by mosquitos. It can also spread through sex with an infected person or from a pregnant woman to her baby.  A Zika virus test looks for signs of the infection in blood or urine.
Mosquitos that carry the Zika virus are most common in areas of the world with tropical climates. These include islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific, and parts of Africa, Central America, South America, and Mexico. Mosquitos carrying the Zika virus have also been found in parts of the United States, including South Florida.
Most people infected with Zika have no symptoms or mild symptoms that last a few days to a week. But a Zika infection can cause serious complications if you are pregnant. A Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a birth defect called microcephaly. Microcephaly can severely affect the development of a baby's brain. Zika infections during pregnancy have also been linked to an increased risk of other birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirth.
In rare cases, children and adults infected with Zika may get a disease called Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is a disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack part of the nervous system. GBS is serious, but treatable. If you get GBS, you will probably recover within a few weeks.
