https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,explain drug name,"Fentanyl is a type of opioid painkiller. It treats moderate to severe cancer pain. It can also help to control breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough pain is pain that occurs despite taking regular painkillers.
Breakthrough pain can happen suddenly and can be very severe. It might be caused by movement or activities such as walking, changing position, or coughing. It can also be unexpected and happen for no apparent reason.
Fentanyl is not available over the counter. You can only get it with a prescription from your doctor.
Fentanyl is also called:
Abstral 
Actiq 
Durogesic DTrans
PecFent
Effentora
Matrifen"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,How fentanyl works,"Fentanyl is a type of opioid. Opioids are strong drugs similar to natural pain killing substances made in our body called endorphins. They were originally made from opium poppies but are now man made in the laboratory.
Opioids block pain messages from travelling along the nerves to the brain."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,How you have fentanyl,"You can have fentanyl in different ways including:
patches 
lollies (lozenges)
tablets that dissolve under your tongue or between the gum and the cheek
nasal spray
Fentanyl patches            
        
      
    
    
      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
You should apply a fentanyl patch on a flat part of your upper body or arm. For example, the inner part of your upper arm, the top of your chest, or on your back. 
To make sure that you get the right dose of fentanyl, find an area of skin that is:
 
clean and dry
not too hairy - you can cut the hair but shouldn't shave the area
not irritated or sore
not a previous radiotherapy site
flat and not likely to wrinkle when you move
has no creams, soap or lotions on it
 
The patches take a while to reach the correct dose at first. So you might need to have another type of painkiller when you put the first patch on. The drug is absorbed slowly into your body over a period of time. Each patch usually lasts 72 hours (3 days). 
Putting a patch on
When you open the packet you need to be careful not to damage the patch, so don’t use scissors. When you stick the patch onto your skin, press hard for about 30 seconds with the palm of your hand. Make sure that it has stuck, especially around the edges.
When you need to change the patch, first take off the old patch. Then put the new one on a different area of skin. Your skin can get sore or itchy if you keep putting the patches in the same place. 
The patches are usually waterproof, so you can shower and bathe while wearing them. But you shouldn't scrub them. The patch can loosen and might not work so well when it is hot or you are sweating a lot. You shouldn't put any direct heat on the patch, such as a hot water bottle. If it becomes loose, you may need to stick some tape over the patch.
 
              
    
  
  
  
    
      
        
            
             Fentanyl lolly (lozenge)            
        
      
    
    
      
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
 
Fentanyl lozenges give fast pain relief. You suck the lozenge and move it around your mouth so that it is in contact with the mouth lining. You might have it to relieve any pain that you get between doses of other painkillers. This is known as breakthrough pain. 
You usually suck the lolly for about 15 minutes. It should start to control pain within 5 minutes and work fully within 30 minutes. You must not bite, chew or swallow the lozenge. And always keep fentanyl lozenges out of sight and reach of children.

You might have fentanyl as tablets that dissolve under your tongue (sublingual). Or as tablets that dissolve between your gum and cheek (buccal). 
 
 
Dissolvable tablets give fast relief of pain. So you might have them to relieve any pain that you get between doses of other painkillers (breakthrough pain). It usually starts to control pain within 5 minutes and works fully within 30 minutes.
Taking the tablets
If your mouth is dry, take a sip of water to moisten it. Spit out or swallow the water. Then place the tablet as far back under your tongue or between your gum and cheek. The tablet starts to dissolve straight away. 
You shouldn't chew or swallow the tablet as it won't work properly. You can eat and drink normally after the tablet has been completely absorbed.

The nasal spray gives very fast pain relief. You might have it if you are feeling sick, have a sore month, or if you can't swallow.
Before you apply the spray, blow your nose if you feel the need to. You then spray the liquid up one nostril, while closing the other nostril with a finger. Then breathe in gently through your nose and out through your mouth."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,When you have fentanyl,"Your doctor or specialist nurse will help you choose the type and dose of fentanyl that best controls your pain. It depends on the pain you have and the amount of drug you need to control it.
You should always take fentanyl exactly as your doctor prescribes it. You shouldn't just stop taking fentanyl. You likely need to slowly reduce the amount you take. Always talk to your doctor or specialist nurse before you change your dose."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,Side effects,"We haven't listed all the side effects. It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
The side effects you have also depend on how you have fentanyl."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fentanyl,Fentanyl,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Drowsiness
Drowsiness may be a problem at first or when your dose is increased, but usually wears off after a few days.
Do not operate machinery or drive if you are feeling drowsy.
Difficulty breathing
You may have difficulty breathing with wheezing and coughing. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when you are taking this drug because it can react with the drug.
Some fentanyl lozenges and tablets contain types of sugar called glucose or sucrose. If you have diabetes, you need to take this into account. The sugars can also harm your teeth. Make sure you clean your teeth regularly.
Alcohol and fentanyl
Don't drink alcohol while using fentanyl because it can increase the drowsiness and other side effects.
Pregnancy and contraception
It is unknown whether treatment may or may not harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment.
Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception you can use during treatment. Ask how long you should use it before starting treatment and after treatment has finished.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Tolerance and addition
Because fentanyl is an opioid, some people worry about becoming addicted. When you take an opioid to control pain, you are very unlikely to become addicted. The body uses the drug to control pain, not to make you feel high."

You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Less commonly one or both corners of your mouth might get sore, red, crack and crust. This can be itchy and painful. Let your doctor or nurse know if this happens.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after having this treatment.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Changes to your fingertips
Your fingers tips might get tender, swell, redden and the skin might get hard and thicken.
Nail changes
You might have nail changes such as ridges or darkening. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any nail changes. They can recommend how best to care for them.
Soreness, redness and peeling on the palms and soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Skin problems
Symptoms of 
skin problems
 can include a rash, blistering, thickening, itching and reddening of the skin. Your skin might get darker in colour, you might develop stretch marks, or raised bumps on the skin
.
Less often areas of skin might peel, leaving your skin sore and inflamed. Your skin might also be sensitive at previous radiotherapy sites and to the sun, but this is rare.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you get any skin rash or a rash that gets worse, or you’re worried about any other changes to your skin.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Heart changes
Tests might show you have changes to your heart rhythm, the way your heart pumps blood around the body and the electrical activity. Your doctor will make sure it is safe for you to start treatment.
Less commonly you might have symptoms if your heart is not pumping blood around the body properly. These symptoms include breathlessness, cough and swelling in your ankles, feet and lower parts of your legs.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you notice any of these changes.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Lung problems
You may develop lung problems such as scarring or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Less commonly you might have difficulty breathing.
Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless, have changes to your breathing, feel tired and weak, develop flu-like symptoms or a cough.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tummy (abdominal) pain

You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
As an injection under your skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while."

You usually have bortezomib twice a week, for 2 weeks. Then you have a break of 10 days. This 3 week period is called a cycle of treatment.
The length of your treatment cycle might be different. Your doctor will discuss this with you.
After 4 cycles of treatment you might have a blood or urine test. This is to check the levels of a protein called serum M.
Serum M is made by myeloma cells. So if the bortezomib is working, the serum M levels go down.

A cycle is a continuous drip of blinatumomab over 4 weeks (28 days). You then have a 2 week break with no drip.
You have up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab. This depends on how your cancer responds to the treatment and how bad the side effects are.
You usually start the treatment in hospital and then go home with the drip after a couple of days or weeks."

When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/blinatumomab,Blinatumomab (Blincyto) ,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Reaction to the infusion
Some people have an allergic reaction to blinatumomab. This reaction is most likely to happen in the first 48 hours of having this drug. Symptoms include fever, chills, muscle pain, rash, facial swelling or difficulty breathing.
You have medicines before starting the drug to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. They will slow down or stop your drip for a while.
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Swelling
This drug can cause a build up of fluid in different parts of your body such as your face, hands, and feet. Let your medical team know if you have any swelling.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include redness of the skin or a rash, that may be itchy or bumpy.  This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Feeling shaky (tremors)
You may develop shakes (tremors) with this treatment. This could be an early sign that the treatment is affecting your nervous system. Let your team know if you start to feel shaky.
Cough
Blinatumomab can cause irritation of the lungs, causing you to cough. Less commonly you might bring up mucus (phlegm). Let your medical team know if you have a cough.
Pain in your tummy (abdomen), back, hands, feet, bones and chest
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can work out the cause and give you medicine to help relieve the pain.
Low blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel light headed or dizzy. You have your blood pressure checked regularly.
Low levels of antibodies called immunoglobulins
Immunoglobulins are antibodies made by the immune system to fight infection. You have regular blood tests during and after treatment to check this.
Cytokine release syndrome
Cytokines are a group of proteins in the body that play an important part in boosting the immune system. Blinatumomab stimulates the immune system to make large amounts of cytokines. This can cause symptoms which can be severe. Some of the symptoms include fever, chills, a headache, difficulty breathing, and dizziness.
Let your medical team know straight away if you have any of these symptoms. You can have treatment to reverse the syndrome.
Fast heartbeat
You may feel that your heart is beating very quickly. This can make you feel dizzy, breathless and tired.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started."

Immunisations
Having immunisations
 - Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines at least 2 weeks before, while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations
 - You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You might have between 2 and 4 treatment cycles. The number of cycles you have depends on:
whether your cancer has spread 
how well your cancer responds to BEP
If you have an early testicular cancer, you may have 2 treatment cycles of BEP. This is to stop the cancer from coming back (recurrence).
If your testicular cancer has spread to another part of your body, you may have 3 or more treatment cycles.
You can have BEP in different ways. A common way of having BEP is:
Day 1
etoposide as an injection into your bloodstream (intravenously) 
cisplatin as an injection into your bloodstream over 1 to 4 hours

Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It is a treatment for prostate cancer."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/bicalutamide,Bicalutamide (Casodex),How it works,"Prostate cancer needs the male hormone testosterone to grow. Testosterone is also called an androgen.
Bicalutamide is a type of hormone drug called an anti androgen. It stops testosterone from reaching the cancer cells. This can slow the growth of your cancer and may shrink it."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/bicalutamide,Bicalutamide (Casodex),When you have bicalutamide,"Bicalutamide is a treatment for prostate cancer. You might have bicalutamide:
on its own
after radiotherapy
after an operation to remove your prostate (prostatectomy)
before you have other hormone treatments such as goserelin (Zoladex), leuprorelin and triptorelin
Reducing tumour flare
You need to take bicalutamide before you start some other types of hormone treatment because they take a few weeks to lower your testosterone. During this time they can make your symptoms worse. This is called tumour flare.
If you are having bicalutamide to stop tumour flare, you take it for a few days before starting the luteinising hormone blocker, and stay on it for about 4 to 6 weeks."

This protein helps cancers to grow blood vessels, so they can get food and oxygen from the blood. All cancers need a blood supply to be able to survive and grow.
Bevacizumab blocks this protein and stops the cancer from growing blood vessels, so it is starved and can't grow. Treatments that interfere with the development of a blood supply are called anti angiogenesis treatments."

High blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are having treatment for high blood pressure. Or if you have headaches, nose bleeds, blurred or double vision or shortness of breath. Your nurse will check your blood pressure regularly.
Feeling of numbness or tingling in hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy)
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
An increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
An increased risk of bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling weak and having no energy
This is usually mild. You can do things to help yourself, including some gentle exercise. It’s important not to push yourself too hard and eat a well balanced diet.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if this effect is stopping you from doing your usual daily activities.
Tiredness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.

diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Loss of appetite and weight
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Eye problems including watery eyes
Watery eyes
 is also called excessive tearing or epiphora (pronounced ep-if-or-ah). Tell your doctor or nurse if this is a problem for you. They can prescribe medicines to help. Try to avoid dust, pollen or animal hairs as they can make the watering worse.
Changes to your voice

Runny nose
You might have a runny nose while having treatment.
Protein in you urine
Small amounts of protein in your urine may be found when your nurse tests your urine. This is not usually a problem and goes away on its own. If there are large amounts of protein you may have tests to check how well your kidneys are working.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Muscle and joint pain

You can have it through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment. You can also have it through a long line: a central line, a PICC line or a portacath.
These are long, plastic tubes that give the drugs into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of your treatment."

You have bendamustine every 4 weeks on day 1 and day 2 of your cycle. Each 4 week period is a cycle of treatment. You then have a break from day 3 to day 28. This completes one cycle of treatment. You have a total of 6 cycles of treatment.
You might also have another drug called rituximab.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
You have bendamustine every 4 weeks on day 1 and day 2 of your cycle. Each 4 week period is a cycle of treatment. You then have a break from day 3 to day 28. This completes one cycle of treatment. You have a total of 6 cycles of treatment.
You also have another drug called rituximab with this drug. You have it on day 1 of each cycle.
Myeloma
You have bendamustine every 4 weeks on day 1 and day 2 of your cycle. And you have the steroid, (methyl)prednisolone either as a drip into your bloodstream or as a tablet for the first 4 days. Each 4 week period is a cycle of treatment. You then have a break from day 3 to day 28. This completes one cycle of treatment.
You have at least 3 cycles of treatment."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/bendamustine,Bendamustine (Levact),Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/bendamustine,Bendamustine (Levact),Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Inflammation of tissue (mucosa)
The mucosa lines a number of different areas in the body such as your mouth, bowel and airways. These can become inflamed and cause side effects. For example if this happens in the bowel it can cause symptoms such as  diarrhoea, pain, cramps and swelling of the tummy (abdomen)
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Kidney damage
To help prevent kidney damage, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

B – Carmustine (BCNU)
E – Etoposide
A – Cytarabine (Ara-C, cytosine arabinoside)
M – Melphalan
It is a treatment for 
Hodgkin lymphoma

You usually have BEAM chemotherapy a week before a stem cell transplant."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/beam,BEAM,Variations of BEAM,"There are different variations of BEAM and this means that some people have lower amounts (doses) of drugs or different cancer drugs. Here are some of the different variations:
LEAM
When lomustine is used instead of carmustine the combination is called LEAM. Lomustine comes as capsules. Your doctor will tell you how much (dose), when and how to take it.
Mini-BEAM
Mini-BEAM uses the same drugs as BEAM but at lower doses.
Dexa-BEAM
This is the same as mini-BEAM with the steroid dexamethasone added to it."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/beam,BEAM,When you have BEAM,"You have BEAM just before you have a stem cell transplant. Doctors call the first day of BEAM treatment minus 6. They then count down to the day you have the stem cells which is called day 0.
You usually go into hospital the day before you start BEAM on day minus 7.
This is what BEAM treatment looks like:
Day -7
You go into hospital.
Day -6
You have carmustine as a drip into your bloodstream over 2 hours.
Day -5
You have cytarabine as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 minutes twice a day.

You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream over 2 hours.
Day -2
You have cytarabine as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 minutes twice a day.
You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream over 2 hours.
Day -1
You have melphalan as a drip into your bloodstream over 15 to 30 minutes.
You also have a drip with fluids running before and after the melphalan.
Day 0
You have the stem cells through a drip into your bloodstream 12 to 24 hours after melphalan.
Day 1 onwards
You recover from the chemotherapy and stem cell transplant. You have other drugs during this time such as medicines to prevent you from feeling or being sick, infection, getting a sore mouth and getting a blood clot.
From day 5 you have G-CSF each day until your white blood cell count is above 1 for at least 24 hours. G-CSF isn’t chemotherapy. It makes the body produce white blood cells to reduce the risk of infection.
You usually stay in hospital for about 2 to 3 weeks after your stem cell transplant."

Drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Many medicines, foods and herbal supplements can react with idelalisib. In particular medicines, foods and herbal supplements which contain CYP enzymes.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Zomorph 
MST 
Sevredol 
Oramorph"

Opioids are strong drugs similar to natural pain killing substances made in our body called endorphins. It is extracted from opium poppies in a laboratory.
Opioids block pain messages from travelling along the nerves to the brain."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/morphine,Morphine ,How you have it,"Morphine is available in different forms such as:
tablets or capsules
liquids
injections
suppositories"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/morphine,Morphine ,Morphine tablets or capsules,"Many people take morphine as tablets or capsules. You take them with a glass of water, with or without food.
There are different types and doses of morphine. They come in different colours to help you tell the doses apart. There are also different brands of morphine. Common types include Sevredol and Oromorph (short acting) or MST Continus and MXL (long acting).
Short acting morphine
Short acting morphine lasts for 2 to 4 hours per dose. Most people start on a short acting morphine tablet or liquid. This is because it is easier and quicker to adjust the dose.
Once your pain is under control, you might change to a long acting (or slow release) tablet or capsule.
Long acting morphine
Long acting morphine lasts from 12 to 24 hours per dose. You take it either once or twice a day.
If you are taking it twice a day, you should take it in the morning and at night, for example at 8am and 8pm.
It is important that you take morphine regularly, even if you don't feel pain. The slow release tablets or capsules can take up to 48 hours to give you a steady dose. So if you stop and start, they won't work so well."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/morphine,Morphine ,Liquid morphine,"Liquid morphine comes as a syrup or as a powder that you dissolve in water.
There are different brands of liquid morphine such as Oramorph (short acting) and MST Continus suspension (long acting powder for dissolving in water)."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/morphine,Morphine ,Morphine injections,"When you can't swallow or are feeling sick, you can have morphine as an injection. There are different ways of having morphine injections such as under the skin (subcutaneous), into a muscle (intramuscular) or into a vein (intravenous).
Injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection)
You may have morphine injections under the skin into your:
stomach
thigh
upper arm
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection, but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the injection site may also go red and itchy for a while.
Some people have morphine under the skin continuously through a small needle connected to a pump called a syringe driver. It gives a continuous small volume of morphine.
Your nurse will change the syringe driver every 24 or 48 hours. This way of having morphine is helpful for people who find it difficult to swallow.
Injections into a vein (intravenously injection)
You can have morphine into your bloodstream. You usually have it through a thin, short tube (a cannula) put into a vein in your arm or the back of your hand. Or you may have it through a central line, a portacath or a PICC line.
These are long, plastic tubes that give the drug directly into a large vein in your chest.
Find out more about central lines"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/morphine,Morphine ,When you have morphine,"Your doctor or specialist nurse will help you choose the type and dose that best controls your pain. It depends on the pain you have and the amount of drug you need to control it.
You may feel drowsy when you first start taking morphine or if the dose is increased. If the drowsiness lasts more than a couple of days talk to your doctor or nurse.
You shouldn't just stop taking morphine suddenly. It is likely that you need to slowly reduce the amount you take. Always talk to your doctor or specialist nurse before you change your dose."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. Let your doctor or nurse know before you start treatment if there is any possibility that you may be pregnant. It is important not to become pregnant while you are having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Goserelin is not a contraceptive and, even if your periods have stopped, you could become pregnant while you are having treatment.
It is important to use reliable contraception, such as the condom or cap (diaphragm), throughout the treatment. Don't take the pill (oral contraceptive). Discuss this with your doctor or specialist nurse. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses or dentists that you’re having this drug if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems."

can’t be removed with surgery
has spread to another area of the body (advanced melanoma)
You can only have vemurafenib if you have a gene change (mutation) called BRAF gene. Your doctor tests tissue from your cancer to check for this mutation."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/vemurafenib,Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) ,How vemurafenib works,"About half of all melanomas have a change in the BRAF gene, which means the cells make too much BRAF protein. This protein makes the cancer cells grow and divide.
Vemurafenib works by targeting this protein and so slows down or stops cancer cells developing."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Women must not become pregnant for at least 3 months after the end of treatment. Men should not father a child for at least 5 months after treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Alcohol
It is important not to drink alcohol while having trabectedin treatment as this may cause damage to the liver.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It is made in the laboratory to recognise and find specific proteins on the outside of some cells. Denosumab is also known by its brand names, Xgeva and Prolia.
It helps to prevent fractures and other cancer related bone problems in adults with cancer that has spread to the bones.
Prolia can reduce the risk of spinal fractures in men who have weakened bones due to hormone therapy for prostate cancer.
It also helps to slow down bone damage in people who have giant cell tumour of the bone (a non cancerous type of bone tumour)."

osteoclasts, which break down old bone
osteoblasts, which build new bone
This process is called bone remodelling and is very well controlled. There is a fine balance between the rates of bone breakdown and growth, which keeps bones strong and healthy.
Denosumab works by targeting a protein called RANKL which controls the activity of osteoclasts. This stops bone cells being broken down and strengthens the bone."

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover:
  Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment. Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery. Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Okay, and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin."

Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.

You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 2 weeks after your final treatment. This is because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Slow wound healing
This drug can slow wound healing. If you need to have an operation you may need to stop taking it for a while beforehand. Your doctor will let you know when you can start taking it again.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

These are long plastic tubes that give the drug into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment.
Find out more about long lines
Taking your capsules
You swallow them with plenty of water.
Don’t chew or suck the capsules because the drug could make your mouth sore if it leaks out. If you do this accidentally, rinse your mouth out over and over again with clean water and contact your doctor or nurse as soon as possible.
Don’t take the capsules with a hot drink as this can make them dissolve too quickly.
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.

It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.

drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Fatigue (during and after treatment)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You have VAI in cycles of treatment. This means that you have all the drugs and then have a rest to allow your body to recover. Each cycle of VAI lasts 3 weeks.
You might have up to 8 cycles, taking around 6 months in total. You usually have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
You have vincristine as a quick drip into your bloodstream.
You have actinomycin D as a drip or a slow injection into your bloodstream.
You have ifosfamide as a drip - this takes around 3 hours.

Other medicines, foods and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 2 months afterwards.
Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Do not breastfeed during this treatment and for at least 2 months afterwards. The drug may come through in the breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/veip,VeIP,How you have it,"You have VeIP into your bloodstream (intravenously).
You have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Find out about having medicine into a vein"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/veip,VeIP,When you have VeIP,"You usually have VeIP as cycles of treatment. A cycle of treatment means that you have a combination of drugs, and then have a rest to allow your body to recover. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks (21 days).
You have 4 cycles, taking around 3 months in total. You may need to stay in hospital for the first 5 days of each cycle.
You might have VeIP in the following way:
Day 1 and 2
You have vinblastine as a drip over 10 minutes.
You have cisplatin as a drip over 2 hours.
You have ifosfamide as a drip over 1 hour.
Days 3, 4 and 5
You have cisplatin as a drip over 2 hours.
You have ifosfamide as a drip over 1 hour.
Day 6 to 21
You have no treatment.
You also have fluids and a drug called mesna. You have this as a drip into your bloodstream. Mesna isn't chemotherapy. It helps to stop the ifosfamide from irritating your bladder and making it bleed."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/veip,VeIP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/veip,VeIP,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss or thinning
You could 
lose all your hair
 or it may just thin. This can affect your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will grow back once treatment has finished. But it is likely to be softer. And it may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Irritation of the bladder and kidneys
This treatment can irritate your bladder and kidneys. Drink as much water as possible to flush out the drugs. Make sure that you pass urine often, especially before you go to sleep. You’ll also have a drug called Mesna to protect your bladder and kidneys.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.

You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can check for the cause of the pain and give you medicine to help.
Sore mouth and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Changes to your hearing
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes."

Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/lapatinib,Lapatinib (Tyverb),What else do I need to know?,"Other medicines, foods and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when you are taking this drug because it can react with the drug.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/co-codamol,"Co-codamol (Kapake, Solpadol, Tylex)",explain drug name,Co-codamol is a type of painkiller. You might have it as a treatment for moderate pain. Co-codamol contains paracetamol. So don’t take co-codamol if you are already taking other medicines that contain paracetamol.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/co-codamol,"Co-codamol (Kapake, Solpadol, Tylex)",How co-codamol works,"Co-codamol is a combination of two drugs – paracetamol and codeine.
Paracetamol controls pain by interfering with substances that the body makes in response to injury. These substances are called prostaglandins. Prostaglandins make nerves more sensitive, so you feel pain. By reducing the amount of prostaglandin you feel less pain, or none at all.
Codeine is a type of opioid. Opioids work by mimicking the body’s natural painkillers, endorphins. They control pain by blocking pain messages to the brain. There are different types of opioids – strong ones and weak ones. Codeine is a weak opioid."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/co-codamol,"Co-codamol (Kapake, Solpadol, Tylex)",How you have co-codamol,"You take co-codamol as a:
tablet that you swallow with water
capsule that you swallow with water
soluble tablet (effervescent or dispersible) that you dissolve in water
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/co-codamol,"Co-codamol (Kapake, Solpadol, Tylex)",When you have co-codamol,"Your doctor or nurse will tell you when to take co-codamol and how much to have. The normal dose for adults is 1 or 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours. The maximum you should take is 8 in 24 hours.
Co-codamol is available in different doses. They all contain 500mg of paracetamol (the same as one regular paracetamol tablet or capsule) but the dose of codeine varies and can be 8mg, 15mg or 30 mg. The dose that is right for you will depend on the amount you need to control your pain.
You can buy small packets of the lower dose preparations over the counter. But for larger packets and higher doses, you need a prescription from your doctor."

It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
You might have one or more of these side effects. They include:
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Mild allergic reaction
You might have a mild allergic reaction during or shortly after your treatment. This could be a rash, itching or a red face.
Mood changes
Mood changes can include feeling very sad or very happy. Tell your doctor or nurse if you’re having mood changes. They can arrange for you to talk to someone and give treatment if necessary.
You may also feel confused or anxious.

This drug may make you feel drowsy or dizzy. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you have this.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches.
Changes to your hearing
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.
Difficulty breathing
You may have difficulty breathing with wheezing and coughing. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Tummy (abdominal) cramps
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Inflammation of the pancreas
This drug can cause inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Tell your doctor straight away if you have sudden and severe pain in your tummy (abdomen).
Difficulty passing urine
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
You may also get hives which is a rash formed of pale red bumps on the skin."

But if you have a reaction to the drip you may have it more slowly over 4 hours.
Drugs into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"

Induction treatment
You have arsenic trioxide every day until there is no sign of the leukaemia in your bone marrow. This is called remission induction. You have this induction treatment for up to 50 to 60 days.
Consolidation treatment
You usually have 20 or 25 doses of arsenic trioxide depending on if you are newly diagnosed. Or if your treatment has come back (relapsed) or not gone away (refractory). You have it for 5 days a week with a 2 day break, for 4 to 5 weeks."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds (thrombocytopenia)
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness (anaemia)
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Loss of appetite
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.

Emtansine is a cancer drug that becomes active once it enters the cancer cell.
Some breast cancers have too much of a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on the surface of their cells. These are called HER2 positive cancers. HER2 makes the cells grow and divide. Trastuzumab attaches to the HER2 receptor. When this happens it allows the emtansine to go into the cancer cell. Inside the cell emtansine becomes active and kills the cancer cell."

Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is a protein that makes cells grow and divide. Some cancers have large amounts of HER2 protein and are called HER2 positive cancers. These drugs work by locking onto HER2 on the cancer cells. The aim is to stop the cells them from growing and kills them.
Trastuzumab and pertuzumab only work if your cancer is HER2 positive. You have tests on your cancer cells to check for this.

When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/trastuzumab-pertuzumab,Trastuzumab and pertuzumab,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Diarrhoea
Pertuzumab can cause severe 
diarrhoea
 that can make you dehydrated and poorly. Contact your advice line or healthcare team when this starts.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Pain in your body, muscle and joints
You might feel some pain from your body, muscles and joints. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Skin and nail problems
Skin and nail problems
 include a skin rash, dry, itching and darker skin. Your nails may also become brittle, dry, change colour or develop ridges. This usually goes back to normal when you finish treatment.
Rarely, you might develop a raised, red, itchy rash which looks like a nettle rash. This is known as hives. Let your healthcare team know if this happens as you might be able to have medicine to help.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms and soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Indigestion or heartburn
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have indigestion or heartburn. They can prescribe medicines to help.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Fluid build up
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve the side effects.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Flu-like symptoms
You may have headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature and shivering. You should contact your advice line urgently if you have these symptoms.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Eye problems
You might have 
eye problems
 including blurred vision, sore, red, itchy, dry eyes (conjunctivitis) or an infection. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can give you eye drops or other medication to help.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.

You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

advanced kidney cancer 
mantle cell lymphoma"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/temsirolimus-torisel,Temsirolimus (Torisel),How it works,"Temsirolimus is a type of targeted cancer drug treatment called an mTOR inhibitor. It blocks the effects of a protein called mTOR that is often over active in cancer cells. This protein makes the cells divide and grow.
Temsirolimus also stops the cancer from making blood vessels, which the cells need to be able to grow. This is called an anti angiogenesis treatment. So temsirolimus might help to stop the cancer growing or may slow the growth of the cancer."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/temsirolimus-torisel,Temsirolimus (Torisel),How you have it,"Temsirolimus is a colourless or pale yellow liquid that you have into your bloodstream (intravenously). It takes between 30 and 60 minutes.
You have an anti histamine drug before each dose.
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/temsirolimus-torisel,Temsirolimus (Torisel),When you have it,"For kidney cancer you have temsirolimus once a week. You usually carry on having it for as long as it works, unless the side effects get severe.
For mantle cell lymphoma you have the drug once a week. You start on a higher dose for the first 3 weeks and then have a lower dose for the rest of your treatment.

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/temsirolimus-torisel,Temsirolimus (Torisel),Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Tiredness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Build up of fluid
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
High blood sugar levels
You have regular blood and urine tests to check this. If you have diabetes you may need to check your blood sugar levels more often than usual.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Talk to your doctor or nurse if you have this.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Low levels of potassium in the blood
Low levels of potassium in the blood is called hypokalaemia. Regular blood tests will check for this.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have cramping in your arm or leg muscles, tingling or numbness, palpitations (feeling your heartbeat irregularly), or if you feel faint.
Joint or muscle pain
You might feel some pain from your muscles and joints. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Kidney changes
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
High cholesterol levels
You will have regular blood tests to check this.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative."

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
You may have shortness of breath for other reasons. Tell your doctor if you feel short of breath.
Bruising, bleeding or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Call your advice line if you have any signs of bleeding. Call 999 if you are bleeding a lot.
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes (peripheral neuropathy)
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Nail changes
During treatment your nails may change colour. This gradually goes after treatment as your nails grow.
Your nail might separate from the nail bed and look white or yellow. The nail may eventually fall off but usually grows back.
Soreness, redness, peeling on palms or soles of the feet (hand foot syndrome)
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
You may also get a rash on your arms, face or chest.
Muscle pain
You might have muscle pain during treatment. Let your treatment team know so they can advise you on how to reduce it.
You may get pain in other areas of the body, such as the bones and less commonly your joints.
Lack of energy and strength
This is usually mild. You can do things to help yourself, including some gentle exercise. It’s important not to push yourself too hard and eat a well balanced diet.
Talk to your doctor or nurse if this effect is stopping you from doing your usual daily activities.
Fluid build up
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes."

It lowers the risk of early breast cancer coming back (recurring) after surgery or developing in the other breast. It can also control advanced breast cancer for some time.
Tamoxifen is sometimes used in women who have a high risk of breast cancer, to prevent breast cancer from developing."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/tamoxifen,Tamoxifen,How tamoxifen works,"Many breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone. These breast cancers are called hormone sensitive or hormone receptor positive. Tamoxifen is usually prescribed for people who have oestrogen receptors in the breast cancer cells. These cells are called oestrogen receptor positive or ER positive.
Tamoxifen works by locking on to the oestrogen receptors to block oestrogen from attaching to them. The oestrogen cannot then stimulate the cells to divide and grow."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/sunitinib,Sunitinib (Sutent),Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Low levels of thyroid hormones
The level of your thyroid hormones may drop (hypothyroidism). You may feel tired or cold, gain weight, feel sad or depressed, or your voice may deepen. You will have regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
High blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are having treatment for high blood pressure, or if you have headaches, nose bleeds, blurred or double vision or shortness of breath. Your nurse will check your blood pressure regularly.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Indigestion
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have indigestion or heartburn. They can prescribe medicines to help.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and changes to your skin colour. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes.
Soreness, redness, peeling on palms or soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Hair colour changes
Your hair colour might change. For some people, the hair may become grey while having this treatment.
Pain in different parts of your body
You might have pain in your arms and legs, back, muscles and joints. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have pain anywhere during or after having treatment. There are lots of ways to treat pain, including relaxation and painkillers.
Tiredness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Swelling in the face, hands and feet
You may have swelling of your face, hands and feet due to a build up of fluid (oedema).
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Inflammation of the bowel
Inflammation of the bowel can cause abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhoea. Speak to your doctor if you have these symptoms."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

They help to control many functions including the immune system, reducing inflammation and blood pressure.
Man-made steroids can also be a treatment for many different conditions and diseases. The information on this page is about steroids used in cancer treatment.
The type of steroids you might have as part of your cancer treatment are usually a type called corticosteroids. These are man-made versions of the hormones produced by the adrenal glands just above the kidneys.
Steroids used in cancer treatment include:
prednisolone
methylprednisolone
dexamethasone
hydrocortisone"

They can:
treat the cancer itself
reduce inflammation
reduce your body’s immune response, for example after a bone marrow transplant
help reduce sickness when having chemotherapy
improve your appetite
You might have them:
when you are first diagnosed
before and after surgery
before and after radiotherapy
before, during and after chemotherapy treatment
for an advanced cancer"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/steroids,"Steroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone)",How you have steroids,"The most common ways of taking steroids during cancer treatment are as:
tablets or liquid (take them after a meal or with milk as they can irritate your stomach)
an injection into a vein (intravenous)
Make sure you take your steroids according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you. Take the right dose, not more or less. And don’t stop taking them without talking to your specialist first."

You might need to take them:
every other day
once a day
several times a day
You should have a steroid card to carry with you all the time if you take steroids for more than 3 weeks. Your doctor or pharmacist might also suggest you wear a medical alert bracelet. This is in case you need treatment in an emergency. It tells the healthcare team you are taking steroids.
Always let your dentist know you're taking steroids."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/steroids,"Steroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone)",Stopping steroid treatment,"Take your steroids exactly as your health professional has told you.
When you take steroid tablets, the higher amounts in your bloodstream stop your body from making its own supply. Stopping them suddenly can cause serious symptoms such as:
pale, cold, clammy skin
sweating
fast, shallow breathing
dizziness
feeling or being sick
diarrhoea
Never just stop taking your tablets. Cut them down gradually with help and guidance from your doctor or pharmacist."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/steroids,"Steroids (dexamethasone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone)",Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

You may get some of them, but it is very unlikely that you will have all of them. You might have some of the side effects at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. We’re unable to give an idea of the frequency of these side effects because it depends on:
what other treatment you are having - for example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy
the aim of the steroid treatment (for example to treat your cancer or to help with symptoms)
if you’re taking steroids short or longer term
the dose of steroids
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
You might have one or more of these side effects. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Steroids can hide or change the signs and symptoms of some infections. They might also make it harder for your body to deal with an infection. This means infections are more difficult to diagnose at an early stage.
Symptoms of an infection include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Mood changes
You might feel more anxious and emotional than usual when you take steroids. You may also feel tired and sad for a while after you stop taking them.
Up to 6 out of 100 people (6%) experience serious mental health problems when they take steroids. This includes depression. Let your doctor know if you notice any changes in your emotional or psychological wellbeing. Let your doctor know if you or any family members have ever had depression or manic depression (bipolar disorder).
Rarely, steroids can cause a reaction called steroid induced psychosis. People can become excited, confused and imagine things that aren’t real. This can be frightening, but it goes away when you stop taking the steroids.
Changes in blood sugar levels
You might have regular blood and urine tests to check this. Some people develop diabetes. You might need to have blood sugar lowering treatment. But your sugar levels usually go back to normal shortly after you stop taking steroids.
If you have diabetes already, you might need to check your blood sugar levels more often than usual.
Increased appetite and weight gain
Steroids can increase your appetite. Feeling hungrier can make it difficult to keep your weight down. Your appetite will go back to normal when you stop steroids - but some people need to diet to lose the extra weight.
Talk to your nurse or your dietitian about how to safely control your weight.
Fluid build up
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about when and where you sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Try and take your steroids in the morning or around lunchtime.
Indigestion or heartburn
Take your tablets after a meal or with milk as they can irritate your stomach.
Steroids can cause ulcers in the stomach or top part of the small bowel (duodenum).
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have:
a gnawing or burning pain in your tummy (abdomen)
indigestion
heartburn
Changes to your face and appearance (Cushing's syndrome)
You might develop:
a swollen or puffy face
stretch marks
acne
increased facial hair
You might put on weight around your tummy (abdomen).
This can be quite upsetting. Talk to your doctor or nurse about any of these side effects.
High blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have headaches, nose bleeds, blurred or double vision or shortness of breath. Your nurse will check your blood pressure regularly.
Eye problems
You might have eye problems including:
clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts) 
glaucoma (damage to an eyesight nerve)
eye infections
problems with your vision, such as blurred vision due to increased pressure on the eyesight nerve
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with your eyes.
Skin changes
Skin changes might include:
rashes
skin thinning
bruising
Wounds might take longer to heal than usual.
Weaker bones
You might have weaker bones due to bone loss (osteoporosis).
Dizziness and loss of balance (vertigo)
You might feel dizzy and you may feel as though the room is spinning. This is vertigo. Let your doctor or nurse know if this happens.
Increased numbers of white blood cells
Steroids can increase the number of white blood cells in your blood. Your doctor might see this on a full blood count test.
Hair changes
You might have more body hair than usual. Your head hair may thin. This is usually not noticeable by other people but can be upsetting.
Heart problems
Steroids can cause severe heart problems if you have had a recent heart attack.
Muscle wasting
Your legs may feel weaker and walking or climbing stairs may be more difficult. You may have aching muscles for a short while after stopping treatment.
Allergic reaction
You might have an allergic reaction to steroids, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel odd or strange.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Growth problems in children
Steroids might cause growth problems in babies, children and teenagers. Your child’s doctor will look at the benefits and risks of prescribing high doses of steroids for your child
Low levels of potassium in your blood
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have cramping in your arm or leg muscles, tingling or numbness, palpitations (feeling your heart beat irregularly), or if you feel faint.
A low level of potassium in the blood is called hypokalaemia. You might have blood tests during cancer treatment to check for this.
Burning or tingling around your bottom
You might have a burning or tingling sensation around your bottom during a steroid injection into a vein (intravenous). It usually goes once the injection finishes. Your nurse will give the injection slowly to try and prevent this.
Epilepsy becoming worse
If you have epilepsy this could become worse when taking steroids.
Blood clots
Blood clots
 can develop in the deep veins of your body, usually the leg. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), although this isn’t common.
Symptoms of a blood clot include:
•    pain, redness and swelling around the area where the clot is and may feel warm to touch
•    breathlessness
•    pain in your chest or upper back – dial 999 if you have chest pain
•    coughing up blood
Tell your doctor immediately or go to A&E if you have any symptoms of a blood clot.
Inflammation of the pancreas
This drug can cause inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Tell your doctor straight away if you have sudden and severe pain in your tummy (abdomen).
Changes to your periods
Women might have irregular periods, or they stop altogether (amenorrhoea).
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working."

Other medicines, food and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting your cancer treatment.
Breastfeeding
There is evidence that steroid drugs may come through into your breast milk. Talk about breastfeeding with your doctor. You can make a decision together based on the benefits to you and the possible risks to your baby.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Slow wound healing
This drug can slow wound healing. If you need to have an operation you may need to stop taking it for a while beforehand. Your doctor will let you know when you can start taking it again.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunistions
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You might have it as a treatment for a number of cancers that affect the bones such as 
myeloma
 
 and 
secondary breast cancer
 
.
You may have sodium clodronate for any of the following reasons:
to treat high blood calcium (hypercalcaemia)
to strengthen weak areas of bone (osteolytic lesions)
to reduce bone pain due to cancers that have spread to the bone
to maintain calcium levels in the body after having treatment with another bisphosphonate drug
Find out about bisphosphonates"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/sodium-clodronate,"Sodium clodronate (Bonefos, Clasteon, Loron)",How does sodium clodronate work?,"Cancer that spreads to the bones encourages the breakdown of bone. This weakens the bones, making them more likely to break (fracture). It can also cause pain and releases calcium from the bone cells into the blood.
Sodium clodronate works by slowing down the breakdown of bone and lowering the amount of calcium lost from the bones. It does this by attaching itself to the bone cells (
osteoclasts
 
) to slow down the activity of the osteoclasts.

You should wait at least 1 hour after you take them before you have a meal or other medicines.
Other foods, especially milk, can stop sodium clodronate being absorbed if they are taken closely together.
Taking your tablets and capsules
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Whether you have a full or empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.

is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
This is usually due to the capsules irritating your stomach. Dividing the dose and taking half in the morning and half in the evening may help reduce sickness.
Low levels of calcium in the blood
You might get low calcium levels which are picked up in blood tests. Rarely low calcium levels can cause painful muscle spasms, cramps or muscle twitching
. 
You might also get numbness or tingling in your feet, hands or around your mouth.
Let your healthcare team know if you develop any of these symptoms.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
It is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 2 weeks afterwards.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rituximab,"Rituximab (Mabthera, Rixathon, Truxima)",explain drug name,"Rituximab is a targeted cancer drug and is also known by its brand names MabThera, Rixathon and Truxima.
It is a treatment for:
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)
some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
some non cancer related illnesses
You might have the original rituximab drug called Mabthera, or a biosimilar such as Truxima or Rixathon. A biosimilar is a very similar copy of the original drug, but it is not exactly the same. Biosimilars undergo strict testing to check they work just as well as the original drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rituximab,"Rituximab (Mabthera, Rixathon, Truxima)",How rituximab works,Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It targets a protein called CD20 on the surface of the leukaemia and lymphoma cells. Rituximab sticks to all the CD20 proteins it finds. Then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rituximab,"Rituximab (Mabthera, Rixathon, Truxima)",How you have rituximab,"You might have rituximab on its own or with other cancer drugs (as part of a treatment regimen). You usually have it as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously).
Depending on your cancer type, you may be able to have rituximab as an injection under your skin (subcutaneous). You can only have rituximab under your skin if you have had at least one dose of rituximab into your vein and you didn't have any serious side effects during the infusion.
Into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
As an injection under your skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rituximab,"Rituximab (Mabthera, Rixathon, Truxima)",When you have rituximab,"For non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
For NHL, you may have rituximab in combination with other cancer drugs or on its own (maintenance therapy).
You usually start by having rituximab in combination with other cancer drugs. You might have it every 2 to 3 weeks, for up to 24 weeks. A common way of having rituximab with other cancer drugs is a treatment regimen called R-CHOP.
If the initial treatment works well, you may then go on to have further rituximab treatment as maintenance therapy. You have this treatment every 2 or 3 months for 2 years.
We have detailed information about R-CHOP
For CLL
You usually have rituximab treatment alongside chemotherapy once a month for 6 months."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rituximab,"Rituximab (Mabthera, Rixathon, Truxima)",Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
An allergic reaction
Some people have an allergic reaction to rituximab. This reaction is most likely to happen during treatment and when you first have the treatment. Symptoms of an allergic reaction include high temperature (fever), chills, feeling or being sick and difficulty breathing.
Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any symptoms of an allergic reaction. They will slow down or stop your drip for a while.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
High temperature (fever), weakness and chills
You might get a high temperature (fever), weakness and chills. Contact your doctor or nurse if you have this.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Low levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin G in your body
Immunoglobulin G is an antibody made by the immune system to fight bacteria and viruses. You have regular blood tests during and after treatment to check for this."

You might have blurred vision or clouding of the lens (cataract). Contact to your team if you have any new problems with your vision.
Shaky hands (tremor)
Talk to the team looking after you about this.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Changes in mineral levels in the blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Kidney changes
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Fluid build up
You may have swelling of your hands and legs due to a build up of fluid (oedema).
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Changes in blood sugar levels
You have regular blood and urine tests to check this. If you have diabetes you may need to check your blood sugar levels more often than usual.
Mood changes and difficulty sleeping
Talk to your healthcare team if your mood is affected.
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Pain
You may have painful bones and joints or muscle pain. Some people have tummy (abdominal pain). Talk to your healthcare team, they may be able to prescribe pain relief.
Flu-like symptoms
You may have headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature and shivering. You should contact your advice line urgently if you have these symptoms.
Dry, sore mouth
Your mouth might get sore. You will have mouth washes to keep your mouth healthy. You can have painkillers to reduce the soreness. Take them half an hour before meals to make eating easier.
If you have a dry mouth it can help to drink plenty of fluids after treatment. An artificial saliva spray into your mouth might help. Ask you healthcare team about this."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Lactose intolerance
This drug contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy and contraception
Lenalidomide can cause birth defects in children. So you must not become pregnant or father a child while taking this drug. Your doctor will talk to you about effective methods of contraception before you have the treatment. Some people worry about taking lenalidomide but it doesn’t cause physical defects in adults.
Because lenalidomide causes birth defects, your doctor will talk to you before you start treatment. They will make sure that you understand the risks of taking lenalidomide and agree to use contraception.
Women
You must use contraception for:
for 4 weeks before you start treatment
during treatment
for 4 weeks after you finish treatment
Women also need to have pregnancy tests every 4 weeks while having treatment and 4 weeks afterwards. Pregnant women should not touch or handle lenalidomide. You must store it in a place where pregnant women or children cannot reach it.
Men
Men with a female partner who is pregnant, or could become pregnant should use condoms :
during treatment
at least 1 week after finishing treatment
You should do this even if you have had an operation to cut or seal the tubes that carry sperm (vasectomy).
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

signals that tell cancer cells to grow
cancer cells forming new blood vessels, which they need to be able to grow"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/regorafenib,Regorafenib (Stivarga),How you have regorafenib,"Regorafenib are tablets you take once a day.
The usual dose is 4 tablets (160mg). But your doctor may change the dose.
You take regorafenib at the same time, each day. You swallow the tablets whole with a drink of water and after a low fat meal. A low fat meal means less than 30% fat.
Some examples of a low fat meal includes:
1 portion of cereal (about 30g)
1 glass of skimmed milk
1 slice of toast with jam
1 glass of apple juice
1 cup of coffee or tea
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have problems swallowing the tablets.
Whether you have a full or an empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rice,RICE,How RICE works,"Ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide are chemotherapy drugs. They destroy quickly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.
Rituximab is a type of targeted drug called a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies target proteins on the surface of cells. Rituximab targets a protein known as CD20. CD20 is found on white blood cells called B cells. It is the B cells that are cancerous in the most common types of lymphoma.
Rituximab attaches itself to the B cells and marks them. The cells of immune system then recognise the marked cells and kill them."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rice,RICE,How you have RICE,"You have all the drugs as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously).
Into your bloodstream
You can have the drug through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Or you might have it through a long line: a central line, a PICC line or a Portacath.
These are long plastic tubes that give the drug into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment.
Find out more about long lines
Mesna and GCSF
You usually have ifosfamide with another drug called mesna. You have mesna either as a drip (infusion) into your bloodstream or as tablets.
Mesna is not a chemotherapy drug. It stops the ifosfamide from irritating your bladder and making the lining bleed.
You usually also have a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF). This makes your bone marrow produce white blood cells more quickly after the chemotherapy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rice,RICE,When you have RICE,"You have RICE as cycles of treatment. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks. You usually have 3 cycles of treatment.

To prevent an allergic reaction you usually have the first dose of rituximab slowly over a few hours. You may also have paracetamol, steroids and an antihistamine drug before the treatment.
Different hospitals give RICE in different ways. A common way of having RICE is described below.
Day 1
You have rituximab as a drip into your bloodstream.
You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream.
Day 2
You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream.

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/rice,RICE,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Liver problems
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Irritation of the lining of the bladder
This treatment can irritate your bladder and kidneys. Drink as much water as possible to flush out the drugs. Make sure that you pass urine often, especially before you go to sleep. You might also have a drug called Mesna to protect your bladder and kidneys.
Changes in the levels of minerals in your body
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Inflammation around the drip site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Skin rash
A rash can also be itchy. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a skin rash. They can prescribe medicine to stop the itching and soothe your skin.
An allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Headaches
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers such as paracetamol to help.
High temperature (fever) and chills
You might get a high temperature (fever), weakness and chills. Contact your doctor or nurse if you have this."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 12 months afterwards because the drugs may come through in the breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

R - rituximab
G - gemcitabine
C - cyclophosphamide
V - vincristine
P - prednisolone
It is a treatment for high grade B cell non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). It is used for people who have heart problems and can’t have some types of chemotherapy, such as the combination R-CHOP."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-gcvp,R-GCVP,How does R-GCVP work?,"Rituximab is a type of targeted cancer drug called a 
monoclonal antibody
 
. It targets a protein called CD20 on the surface of the lymphoma cells. Rituximab sticks to all the CD20 proteins it finds. Then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them.
Gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide and vincristine are types of chemotherapy drugs. These drugs destroy quickly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.
Prednisolone is a type of steroid. It treats lymphoma by stopping the cancer cells growing and killing them. It may also help you feel less sick during treatment. And help reduce your body’s immune response, to try and prevent an allergic reaction to rituximab."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-gcvp,R-GCVP,How you have R-GCVP?,"You take prednisolone as tablets. You swallow the tablets whole after a meal, or with milk, as they can irritate your stomach. It is best to take them after breakfast.
You usually have all the other drugs into your bloodstream (intravenously).
Into your bloodstream
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Taking you tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have problems swallowing the tablets.
Whether you have a full or an empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, no more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-gcvp,R-GCVP,How often do you have R-GCVP?,"You have R-GCVP as cycles of treatment. This means you have the drugs and then a rest to allow your body to recover.  You usually have 6 cycles of treatment.
Each cycle of treatment lasts 21 days (3 weeks).
You have R-GCVP in the following way:
Day 1
You take prednisolone tablets once a day in the morning with or after food.
You have rituximab as a drip (infusion) into your bloodstream.
You have gemcitabine as a drip into your bloodstream for about 30 minutes.
You have vincristine as a short drip into your bloodstream over10 minutes.
You have cyclophosphamide as a short drip into your bloodstream over 10 minutes.
Days 2 to 5
You take prednisolone tablets once a day in the morning with or after food.
Day 6 to 7
You have no treatment.
Day 8
You have gemcitabine as a drip into your bloodstream for about 30 minutes.
Day 9 to day 21
You have no treatment.
You then start the next cycle of treatment.
Infusion related reaction to rituximab
Some people can have an allergic reaction to rituximab. So the first time you have it very slowly over about 4 hours. This helps to prevent a reaction. Your nurse will give you paracetamol and another drug called chlorphenamine (Piriton) about 30 minutes before you start.
If you start to have a reaction your nurse will stop the infusion. They start it again once your symptoms have got better and it is safe to do so. If you don't have a reaction, you should be able to have your next rituximab infusion at a faster rate (over about 90 minutes)."

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Hearing changes
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Low blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel light headed or dizzy. You have your blood pressure checked regularly.
Sore and red eyes
Sore, red eyes can happen because cytarabine is partly removed from your body (excreted) in your tears. You will have steroid eye drops to help prevent sore eyes.
Low levels of sodium in your body
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, such as low sodium. This will most likely go back to normal when you finish treatment. You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
High levels of uric acid in your body
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause a type of arthritis known as gout. You’ll have regular blood tests to check these levels.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
An allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for a year afterwards because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-dhap,R-DHAP,explain drug name,"R-DHAP is a cancer drug combination made up of the drugs:
R – rituximab (also called Mabthera), a type of targeted cancer drug called a monoclonal antibody
DH – dexamethasone, which is a steroid
A – cytarabine (also known as Ara C), a chemotherapy drug
P – cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug
It is a treatment for high grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-dhap,R-DHAP,How it works,"These cancer drugs destroy quickly dividing cells, such as cancer cells."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-dhap,R-DHAP,How you have it,"Cytarabine and cisplatin are colourless fluids that you have into your bloodstream (intravenously). Rituximab is a colourless fluid that you might have into your bloodstream or as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection).
You usually have the steroid drug (dexamethasone) as tablets (orally) but you may also have it into your bloodstream. If you take dexamethasone as tablets, you should swallow them whole after a meal, or with milk, as they can irritate your stomach. It is best to take them early in the day, immediately after breakfast.
Drugs into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
An injection under the skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-dhap,R-DHAP,When you have R-DHAP,"You have R-DHAP as cycles of treatment. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks. You may have 1 or 2 cycles.
You have each cycle in the following way:
Day 1
You have dexamethasone tablets or as a drip into your bloodstream. 
You have rituximab as a slow drip into your bloodstream. 
You have cisplatin as a drip into your bloodstream for 24 hours. 
You have hydration fluids as a drip into your bloodstream.
Day 2
You have cytarabine as a drip into your bloodstream twice (each drip lasts for 3 hours and you have them 12 hours apart).
You have hydration fluids as a drip into your bloodstream. 
You have dexamethasone tablets or as a drip into your bloodstream.
Day 3 and 4
You have dexamethasone tablets or as a drip into your bloodstream.
Day 5 to day 21
You have no treatment.
You then start a new treatment cycle.
Your nurse or doctor will give you steroid eye drops to use for 5 to 7 days to help prevent your eyes getting sore.
Allergic reaction
Some people can have an allergic reaction to rituximab so you have the first dose slowly over about 4 hours. To help prevent a reaction you will have paracetamol and a drug called chlorphenamine (Piriton). If you have a reaction your nurse will stop the drip. They will start it again once your symptoms have reduced. You should be able to have further doses of rituximab at a faster rate (about 2 hours)."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-dhap,R-DHAP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment.

This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-chop,R-CHOP,explain drug name,"R-CHOP is a cancer drug combination. It includes:
R - rituximab 
C – cyclophosphamide
H – doxorubicin hydrochloride
O – vincristine (which used to be called Oncovin)
P – prednisolone (a steroid)
It is a treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also a treatment for a rare type of Hodgkin lymphoma called nodular lymphocyte predominat Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL)."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-chop,R-CHOP,How R-CHOP works,"These chemotherapy drugs destroy quickly dividing cells, such as cancer cells.
Rituximab is a type of targeted cancer drug called a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies target proteins on the surface of cells. Rituximab targets a protein known as CD20. CD20 is found on white blood cells called B cells. It is the B cells that are cancerous in the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Rituximab attaches itself to the B cells and marks them. The cells of the immune system recognise the marked cells and kill them."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-chop,R-CHOP,How you have R-CHOP,"You have the drugs into your bloodstream (intravenously).
Prednisolone is a steroid. You take this as a tablet in the morning after food.
Into your bloodstream
You can have the drug through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Or you might have it through a long line: a central line, a PICC line or a Portacath.
These are long plastic tubes that give the drug into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment.
Find out more about long lines
An injection under your skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-chop,R-CHOP,When you have R-CHOP,"You usually have R-CHOP in cycles of treatment over 3 weeks. A usual course of treatment consists of between 3 and 8 cycles so it can last from 9 to 24 weeks.
Some people have an allergic reaction to rituximab. This can cause flu like symptoms such as fever and sickness. To prevent an allergic reaction you usually have the first dose of rituximab slowly over a few hours. You may also have paracetamol, steroids and an antihistamine drug before the treatment.
Some people may have R-CHOP over 2 weeks. You have the drugs in exactly the same way, but with less of a break between treatments. Doctors call treatment over 2 weeks R-CHOP14. Treatment over 3 weeks is called R-CHOP21.
On the first day of each cycle you have the following drugs:
rituximab
cyclophosphamide
vincristine
doxorubicin
You have prednisolone (steroid) tablets to take at home for 5 days. Then you have a break with no treatment until the next treatment cycle starts."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/r-chop,R-CHOP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse

Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Loss of appetite and loss of weight
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
General swelling
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days."

Some cancers use hormones to grow or develop. This means the cancer is hormone sensitive or hormone dependent.
Medroxyprogesterone may work by interfering with the hormone balance in the body so that there are smaller amounts of the hormones that some cancers depend on to grow. It may also interact with other hormones or have a direct effect on the cancer to stop it growing."

Leuprorelin lowers the level of oestrogen in the body by stopping the ovaries making oestrogen. This is because high levels of oestrogen can help the cancer to grow.  This injection can be given on it's own, or with other hormone therapies."

Aldesleukin works in a number of ways. It:
works directly on cancer cells by interfering with how the cells grow and multiply
stimulates the immune system by encouraging the growth of killer T cells and other cells that attack cancer cells
encourages cancer cells to send out chemicals that attract immune system cells"

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ponatinib,Ponatinib (Iclusig),Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathless and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Pain
You might feel some pain from your muscles and joints. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Dizziness
This drug may make you feel drowsy or dizzy. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you have this.
High blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have headaches, nose bleeds, blurred or double vision or shortness of breath. Your nurse will check your blood pressure regularly.
Cough
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Fluid build up (swelling)
This usually goes away on its own, but
 
tell your doctor or nurse if you have it.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost."

You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Ibuprofen (Neurofen)
You should avoid taking ibuprofen from 5 days before and up until 2 days after pemetrexed. Ibuprofen can make the pemetrexed side effects worse.
Pregnancy and contraception
These drugs may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you want to have a baby in the future. You may be able to store sperm before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)

Into your bloodstream
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath

Each cycle of treatment lasts 21 days (3 weeks).
Depending on your cancer, you may have between 4 and 6 cycles of treatment, taking about 4 months in total.
You have each treatment cycle in the following way:
Day 1
You have pemetrexed as a drip into your bloodstream over 10 minutes.
You have carboplatin as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 to 60 minutes.
Day 2 to 21
You have no treatment.
You then start a new cycle of treatment.
To help reduce the side effects of this treatment, you have:
folic acid tablets – starting 1 to 3 weeks before treatment and for 3 weeks afterwards
vitamin B12 injections – starting 1 to 3 weeks before treatment and then once, every 9 weeks (with every third cycle)
You may also have a steroid tablet to help with the side effects, starting on the day before your chemotherapy. You take the tablets twice a day, for up to 3 days (with breakfast and lunch)."

Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Sore mouth and throat
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Skin rash
A rash can also be itchy. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a skin rash. They can prescribe medicine to stop the itching and soothe your skin.
Hair thinning and hair loss
Your 
hair may thin
 but you’re unlikely to lose all your hair. This usually starts after your first or second cycle of treatment. It is almost always temporary and your hair will grow back when you finish your treatment.
Kidney changes
You might have some changes in the way your kidneys work. You'll have regular blood tests to check how well they are working.
Changes in the levels of substances in your body
Your blood contains different minerals, salts, proteins and enzymes. This treatment can change the levels of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium in your blood. It can also change enzymes levels which can affect your bones and liver.
You have regular blood tests to check for any changes."

This treatment affects the immune system. This may cause inflammation in different parts of the body which can cause serious side effects. They could happen during treatment, or some months after treatment has finished. In some people, these side effects could be life threatening.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."

Feeling or being sick (nausea)
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.

Tell your doctor if you have any rashes or itching. Don't go swimming if you have a rash because the chlorine in the water can make it worse.
If your skin gets dry or itchy, smoothing in unperfumed moisturising cream may help. Check with your doctor or nurse before using any creams or lotions. Wear a high factor sun block if you’re going out in the sun.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
You may also be breathless and have a cough. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Low levels of thyroid hormones
The level of your thyroid hormones may drop (hypothyroidism). You may feel tired or cold, gain weight, feel sad or depressed, or your voice may deepen. You will have regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.

Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Loss of appetite

lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.

Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.

Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/pomb-ace,POMB/ACE,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Rarely you might bleed from other areas of the body. Tell your medical team if you notice any bleeding.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Sore mouth, throat and lips
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
. Symptoms might include yellowing of the skin and whites of your eyes (jaundice). Or changes might only show on your blood tests.
You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the levels of liver enzymes.
Indigestion or heartburn
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have indigestion or heartburn. They can prescribe medicines to help.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can check for the cause of the pain and give you medicine to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Kidney changes
You might have some changes in the way your kidneys work. You'll have regular blood tests to check how well they are working.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Diarrhoea and constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Changes in levels of minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium, magnesium, calcium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Inflammation around the drip site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Lung problems
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Poor blood flow in your fingers and toes
These areas might look pale and feel cold. Tell your medical team if this is happening.
Scleroderma
This is an autoimmune condition which can happen with bleomycin. Collagen is laid down in the skin and body organs, thickening them and stopping them working well. It can affect joints, tendons, and internal organs.
Skin and nail problems
Skin and nail problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin, itching and darker skin. Your nails may also become brittle, dry, change colour or develop ridges. This usually goes back to normal when you finish treatment.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Soreness and inflammation of the bladder
Inflammation of the bladder causes a burning feeling when passing urine and the need to pass urine often. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this and try to drink plenty of fluids.
Less commonly your urine might have blood in it, passing urine may be painful or you may find it difficult to pass urine.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when you’re having this treatment as it can react with these drugs.
Avoid drinking alcohol while having this treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with these drugs and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

E – etoposide (also known as Vepesid, Eposin or Etopophos)
P – cisplatin (sometimes called platinum)
It is a treatment for:
small cell lung cancer
germ cell cancers, these most often occur in the ovary or testicle
small cell of the neck of the womb (cervix)"

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ep,EP,How you have EP,"You have etoposide and cisplatin into your bloodstream (intravenously). You can have the drugs through a thin, short tube (a cannula) put into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
Etoposide also comes as capsules that you swallow.
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Whether you have a full or empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."

Lung cancer
For lung cancer you have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
Etoposide as a drip for a couple of hours
Cisplatin as a drip for a couple of hours
Day 2 and 3 
Etoposide as a drip or you have it as capsules that you take at home for 4 days
Days 4 or 5 to 21
You have no treatment during this time. Then you start the cycle again.
Germ cell cancer
For germ cell cancer of the ovary or testicle, you have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
Etoposide and cisplatin as a drip for a couple of hours
Day 2 and 3
Etoposide as a drip, in some hospitals you may also have a further 2 days of etoposide as a drip
You have no treatment for just over 2 weeks. Then you start the next cycle.
Small cell cervical cancer
For small cell cervical cancer you have each cycle in the following way:
Day 1, 2 and 3
Etoposide and cisplatin as a drip for a couple of hours
Day 4 and 5
Etoposide on its own as a drip
You have no treatment for 17 days. Then you start the next cycle.
Fluids
You will have fluids (sterile salt water or saline) into your drip before and after the EP drips. This helps to keep your kidneys working properly."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.

 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Kidney changes

kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Hearing changes
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Inflammation around the drip site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Low blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel light headed or dizzy. You have your blood pressure checked regularly.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.

skin problems
 can include rash and itching.
Less commonly your skin might develop reddening of the skin, dryness, pale white patches of the skin (vitiligo), raised red crusty ring like patches, it may get flaky, your face might get red or you might develop spots.
Your doctor will check your skin regularly throughout your treatment.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you get any skin rash or a rash that gets worse, or you’re worried about any other changes to your skin.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 4 loose watery poos (
diarrhoea
) or more in 24 hours. Or if you have diarrhoea for more than 3 days. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid.
Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty of liquid to replace the fluid lost.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Changes in blood sugar levels
You might get changes to your blood sugar levels. Some of the symptoms for high blood sugar levels (hyperglycaemia) are feeling very thirsty, a dry mouth, passing urine very often, feeling tired, blurred vision, weight loss, feeling or being sick, and fruity smelling breath.
Less commonly you might get a low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia). These symptoms include: sweating, feeling hungry, shaky, trembling, fast heartbeat, dizziness, changes to your mood, and feeling tired.
Rarely you may develop diabetes.
Contact your team or advice line if you have any of these symptoms.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Kidney changes
You might have some changes in the way your kidneys work. You'll have regular blood tests to check how well they are working.
High levels of pancreatic enzymes in your blood
You might have high levels of substances (enzymes) called amylase and lipase in your blood. It doesn’t usually cause symptoms. You have regular blood tests to check this and they return to normal when you stop treatment.
Feeling sick
Feeling sick
 is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicine. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques, can all help.
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel sick.
Changes in the levels of minerals in your body
Your blood contains different minerals and electrolytes. This treatment can change the levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, and potassium in your blood.
You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Changes to your blood counts
Your blood might show a low number of red blood cells (anaemia) or platelets that helps your blood to clot. You will have regular blood tests to check your blood count levels."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant while you are having treatment and for 5 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Fertility

Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover:
  Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin.
As an injection into the muscle
Your nurse gives you the injection in your bottom. They vary the site of the injection. So you might have one injection on the right side and the next injection on the left.
You usually have a stinging or dull ache for a short time, but they don’t usually hurt much."

There are 2 types of octreotide:
short acting
long acting (also called Sandostatin LAR)
Short acting octreotide
Short acting octreotide starts to work straight away. But the drug only stays in your body for a short period of time. This means that you need to have octreotide injections more often.
You usually have short acting octreotide as injections under the skin once or twice a day.
Long acting octreotide
Long acting octreotide is slowly absorbed by the body. This means that the drug stays in your body for longer.
You usually have long acting octreotide as an injection into the muscle in your bottom once every 4 weeks."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/octreotide-sandostatin,Octreotide (Sandostatin),Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better

Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Feeling sick (nausea)
Feeling sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Having Octreotide subcutaneous injections between meals or when you go to bed may help to reduce this.
Tummy (abdominal) pain and bloating
Octreotide might cause tummy pain, or less often can make you feel bloated. Tell your healthcare team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Gallstones
Gallstones are hard lumps, like little rocks that form in the gallbladder. In most cases, they don’t cause symptoms and you don’t need to have treatment unless you have:
a high temperature 
severe and sudden tummy (abdominal) pain 
yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
Changes in blood sugar levels
High blood sugar levels can cause headaches, feeling thirsty and blurred vision.
Less commonly your blood sugar level may be low. This can make you may feel shaky, sweat more than usual, or feel confused.
You have regular tests to check your blood sugar levels. You may need to check your levels more often if you are diabetic.

Monoclonal antibodies work by recognising and finding specific proteins on cells.
Obinutuzumab targets a protein called CD20 on the surface of the lymphoma and leukaemia cells. Obinutuzumab sticks to all the CD20 proteins it finds. This makes it easier for the cells of the immune system to pick out the marked cells and kill them."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/neratinib,Neratinib (Nerlynx),How neratinib works,"Neratinib is a targeted cancer drug that works on a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 proteins make cells divide and grow. Some cancers have large amounts of HER2 proteins which can cause cancer cells to divide and grow faster.
Neratinib works by locking onto the HER2 on the cancer cells. So it stops the cells from growing.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for some time afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Women
 need to use contracption during treatment and for 
3 months
 afterwards.
Men
 need to use contraception during treatment and for 
6 months
 afterwards.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It works by blocking an enzyme called topo isomerase 2 that cancer cells need in order to divide and grow.
Liposomal doxorubicin is doxorubicin contained in tiny spheres called pegylated liposomes. These spheres keep the doxorubicin in the bloodstream longer, so that more of the drug reaches the cancer cells."

It usually takes between 30 to 90 minutes each time you have it.
Into your bloodstream
You have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Or you might have treatment through a long line: a central line, a PICC line or a portacath. These are long plastic tubes that give the drug into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums and nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue) during and after treatment
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Sore throat
You might have a sore throat or pain on swallowing.
Soreness, redness and peeling of your hands and feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Red or orange urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Diarrhoea or constipation

This could be caused by not enough blood getting to your heart. Contact your healthcare line or tell your healthcare team if you have any chest pain.
Sore mouth and throat
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Sore, red, peeling palms of hands or soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Delayed wound healing
It might take longer for wounds to heal while having this treatment.
Feeling tired, weak and lacking energy (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
DPD deficiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Sodium
This drug contains sodium (salt). You might need to take account of this if you are on a controlled sodium diet. Tell your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
You always have a drug called mesna with ifosfamide. You either have this through your drip in a separate bag, before or after the ifosfamide, or they can be mixed together in one bag.
Usually you have a lot of fluid too, so the drugs take a long time to go through the drip. You may need to stay overnight at the hospital."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ifosfamide,Ifosfamide (Mitoxana),When you have ifosfamide,"You usually have ifosfamide as a course of several cycles of treatment, which means you have the drug and then a break with no treatment."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/mitotane-lysodren,Mitotane,explain drug name,Mitotane pronounced my-toe-tain is a chemotherapy drug. It is also called Lysodren. It is used to treat a rare type of adrenal gland cancer (adrenal cortical cancer) that has spread or come back.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/mitotane-lysodren,Mitotane,How it works,Researchers are still looking into how mitotane works. We know that it reduces the amount of hormones produced by the adrenal gland. This can control or shrink the cancer for some time.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/mitotane-lysodren,Mitotane,How you have mitotane,"Mitotane are tablets you take 2 or 3 times a day. You take them with a glass of water during, or straight after, a meal. It is best to take them with foods that contain fats such as milk, chocolate or vegetable oils. This will affect how much drug gets into your bloodstream.
Don't take a double dose of the mitotane if you forget to take it. Just continue with your usual dose.
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Never stop taking a cancer drug without talking to your specialist first.
Steroids and mitotane
You may need to take a steroid when you are taking mitotane. This is because mitotane lowers the amount of natural steroids produced by the adrenal glands. These steroids help the body to react quickly in stressful situations such as a shock, injury or infection.
If you have a severe injury or become very unwell you may need to stop taking mitotane. You have a card to carry saying you are taking mitotane. In the case of an accident or sudden illness the card tells the doctor you are taking mitotane and may also be taking steroids."

Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
It is unknown whether treatment may or may not harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment.
Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception you can use during treatment. Ask how long you should use it before starting treatment and after treatment has finished.
Fertility
It is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Blood tests might show that your blood takes longer to clot.
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Heart changes
You may have changes to how your heart works such as your heart rhythm. Tests such as a heart trace (ECG) might pick this up.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Headaches

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums and nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Mouth sores and ulcers

You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It is also called Megace or megestrol. It is a man made version of the hormone progesterone. Progesterone is one of the female hormones but men also produce a small amount of it.
Megestrol acetate is a treatment for the following cancers that have come back or spread from where they started.
breast cancer
womb cancer
It is also a treatment for poor appetite. Your doctor might suggest you take it if you have lost weight because of cancer or its treatment. Doctors might also use it as a treatment for women who have hot flushes due to their cancer or its treatment."

You have alemtuzumab as a drip (an infusion) over 2 hours. You usually have treatment 3 times a week, for between 4 and 12 weeks.
You start on a low amount (dose) and the doctor gradually increases the dose until you are having the recommended amount. This is called dose escalation. Doctors do this because some people react to the treatment. By gradually increasing the dose you are less likely to react.
Rarely for CLL, you might also have alemtuzumab as an injection under the skin.
For skin lymphoma
You have alemtuzumab as an injection under the skin. You have this 3 times a week for up to 12 weeks.

Reaction to the infusion
Some people have a reaction to alemtuzumab. This reaction is most likely to happen in the first week of having this drug. Symptoms might include feeling or being sick, low blood pressure making you feel weak and faint, fever, chills, diarrhoea, rash, facial swelling or difficulty breathing.
Rarely, you might have a sever allergic reaction to the drug which can be life threatening.
Your nurse keeps a close eye on you when you have the drug and gives you medicine beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell them straight away if you have any symptoms or don’t feel quite right. They will slow down or stop your drip for a while.
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Cytomegalovirus is a common virus that is closely related to the herpes virus. It can remain inactive in your body for many years. But in some people, alemtuzumab can cause it to become active again (reactivate) due to your lowered immune system. This usually happens about 3 to 8 weeks after you started the drug.
Symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature, and shivering. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of these symptoms.
You have regular blood tests to check for this virus. It’s important you have treatment if it does come active again.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
You might bleed from other parts of your body, so you might find blood in your wee or poo for example. Or you might have unusually heavy periods.
Rarely you might have a bleed on the brain. Symptoms include a headache, feeling or being sick, confusion, seizures (fits) or loss of eyesight.
Call your advice line if you have any bleeding.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Sweating more than normal
This drug can cause you to sweat more than normal. Let your doctor or nurse know if this happens.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help and check for causes.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a raised, red, itchy skin rash.
Less commonly alemtuzumab can cause blisters and a sudden reddening of your skin (flushing).
Your skin usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Less commonly you may lose weight. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Pain in your body, muscles and joints
You might feel some pain from different areas of your body such as your tummy (abdomen), bones, muscles and at the site of injection if you have the drug this way.
You might get pain in your back, chest and joints, but this is less common.
Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Dizziness
This drug might make you feel dizzy. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you have this.
Abnormal feeling in your body
You may have an abnormal feeling (sensation) in your body, particularly in your legs and feet, such as burning, prickling or aching.
Less commonly you may have pins and needles or be less sensitive to touch, vibrations or the cold.
This is usually temporary and improves after treatment. Tell your doctor if you have these symptoms.
Difficulty breathing or a cough
It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you have a cough or are breathless. It may be a sign of infection or inflammation in the lungs.
Less commonly this can cause your body not to get enough oxygen to the rest of your body. You might feel confused, restless, your breathing may get faster, and your heartbeat might increase. You might also get changes to the colour of your skin such as a bluish colour. This is called hypoxia. Some lung problems can also cause a high pitched whistling sound (wheeze).
Let your medical team know straight away if you get any of these symptoms.
Blood pressure changes
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel light headed or dizzy as it might be a sign that you have a low blood pressure. Less commonly you might get high blood pressure. You nurse checks your blood pressure regularly."

methotrexate 
vinblastine 
doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 
cisplatin
MVAC is a treatment for bladder cancer. It is often used to try to stop bladder cancer from coming back after surgery. This is called adjuvant therapy.
Sometimes it is also used to shrink the cancer before surgery or radiotherapy. This is known as neoadjuvant therapy. You may also have it for bladder cancer that has spread to other parts of the body."

Usually, you have between 3 to 6 cycles of MVAC or 3 to 6 cycles of accelerated MVAC.
If you have it over 2 weeks (accelerated MVAC)
Day 1

After chemotherapy you may also have a drug called GCSF. You have it as injections under the skin. GCSF encourages the bone marrow (where the blood cells are made) to make more white blood cells.
If you have it over 4 weeks
Day 1

Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Lung changes
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Problems with the nerves and brain
Lomustine can sometimes affect the nerves and brain causing:
confusion
extreme tiredness
difficulty walking
loss of balance
Talk to your doctor straight away if you have any of these symptoms.
Kidney changes
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Second cancers
There is a risk that you may develop some types of blood cancer years after this treatment. These include:
acute leukaemia 
myelodysplastic syndrome
Your doctor will discuss this with you."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy.
Alcohol
Alcohol can increase the side effects of lomustine, and make you feel very unwell. Don't drink alcohol while taking this medicine."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",How cladribine works,Cladribine is one of a group of chemotherapy drugs known as anti metabolites. These stop cells making and repairing DNA. Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA so that they can grow and multiply. Cladribine kills abnormal white blood cells.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",How you have cladribine,"There are 2 types of cladribine, these are called Leustat and LITAK.
You have Leustat into your bloodstream (intravenously). Or you have LITAK as an injection just under the skin (subcutaneous injection)."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",Into your bloodstream,"You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover: 
 Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",When you have Leustat,"For hairy cell leukaemia you usually have intravenous Leustat as a continuous drip for 7 days.
For chronic lymphocytic leukaemia you usually have Leustat as a 2 hour drip each day for 5 days every 4 weeks. Each 4 week period is called a cycle of treatment. You may have up to 6 cycles.
Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called allopurinol to lower blood levels of uric acid which can build up in your blood when the leukaemia cells are killed."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",When you have LITAK,"For hairy cell leukaemia you have LITAK as injections just under the skin each day for 5 days. Your doctor or nurse may show you how to do this yourself.
Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called allopurinol to lower blood levels of uric acid which can build up in your blood when the leukaemia cells are killed.
If you inject a wrong dose of LITAK by accident, tell your doctor straight away. If you accidentally forget a dose, don't inject a double dose to make up for it but let your doctor know as soon as possible."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cladribine,"Cladribine (Leustat, LITAK)",Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Dizziness
This drug may make you feel drowsy or dizzy. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you have this.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Cough
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Skin rash
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Pain at drip site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Sweating
Talk to the team looking after you about this.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/letrozole-femara,Letrozole (Femara),What is letrozole?,"Letrozole is a treatment for breast cancer for women who have been through their menopause. It is a type of hormone therapy drug. It is a tablet, you take once a day.
You might have it:
after other treatments for breast cancer to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back
before surgery to reduce the size of the cancer   
as a treatment for advanced cancer (secondary cancer)
It varies how long you will take it for, you might take it for:
between 4 and 8 months if you are taking it before surgery
5 years if you are taking it after other treatment to reduce the risk of your cancer coming back
for as long as it is working if you’re taking it for advanced cancer"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/letrozole-femara,Letrozole (Femara),How does letrozole work?,"Letrozole lowers the levels of the female sex hormone oestrogen in the body. Oestrogen stimulates some breast cancers to grow. These breast cancers are called hormone sensitive or hormone receptor positive. Letrozole can stop or slow the growth of these cancers.
Letrozole only works in women who have had their menopause.
After the menopause, women don't produce oestrogen from their ovaries. But they still produce a small amount by using an enzyme called aromatase which turns other sex hormones called androgens into oestrogen. This change happens mainly in fatty tissue, muscle and the skin. Letrozole is a type of drug called an aromatase inhibitor. It blocks aromatase so that it can't change androgens into oestrogen."

Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug.
If you accidentally take too much letrozole (Femara)

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/lenvatinib,"Lenvatinib (Lenvima, Kisplyx)",Common side effects,"These effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
You may also have bleeding in different parts of your body such as the lungs, brain and tummy (abdomen). This can be life threatening. Speak to your doctor or nurse straightway in you have any signs of bleeding.
Changes to your blood pressure
During treatment, your blood pressure may be lower or higher than normal. Tell your nurse if you feel dizzy, faint, or if you have headaches, nosebleeds, blurred or double vision, or shortness of breath. Your blood pressure usually goes back to normal while you are on treatment or when treatment ends.
Constipation or diarrhoea
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.
Difficulty speaking
You might have difficulty speaking or a hoarse voice. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have this.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Indigestion
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have indigestion or heartburn. They can prescribe medicines to help.
Dry mouth
A dry mouth
 is also called xerostomia (pronounced zero-stow-mee-a). Talk to your nurse or doctor if you have this. They can give you artificial saliva to help with a dry mouth. It can also help to drink plenty of fluids.
Changes to levels of thyroid hormones
The levels of your thyroid hormones may change. You may feel tired or cold, gain weight, feel sad or depressed, or your voice may deepen. You will have regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms or soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Hair loss
Your
 hair may thin
 but you’re unlikely to lose all your hair. It is almost always temporary and your hair will grow back when you finish your treatment.
Pain in different parts of your body
You may have pain in different parts of your body such as your tummy (abdomen), back, muscles, bones and joints. Speak to your treatment team if you have this. They can give you painkillers to help with this.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Swollen hands and legs
You may have swelling of your hands and legs due to a build up of fluid (oedema).
Protein in your urine

Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You might have it as a treatment:
for carcinoid syndrome
to control the growth of some advanced neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) of the intestine and pancreas when surgery is not possible
Carcinoid syndrome is a group of symptoms that some people get when they have a
 neuroendocrine tumour
 
 (NET). The symptoms happen when the NET makes large amounts of hormones.
Carcinoid syndrome is more common in people with a NET that has spread to the liver."

It slows down or stops the production of a number of hormones such as insulin and gut hormones. It also controls the emptying of the stomach and bowel.
Lanreotide is a synthetic version of somatostatin (a somatostatin analogue) and slows down the production of hormones. This helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome and slow down the growth of the cancer.
Some of the symptoms you may have with carcinoid syndrome include flushing of the skin, diarrhoea, and tummy (abdominal) pain."

As an injection under the skin
You have an injection under the skin into your bottom or upper thigh.
Your nurse usually gives you the injections or they might show you how to do this yourself. They can also show a family member or friend how to give you the injections.
Your skin around the injection site might go red and itchy for some time after the injection. It’s important that you regularly change the site where you give the injection.

Nurse: 
This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover:
  Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin.
As an injection into the muscle
Your nurse gives you the injection in your bottom. They vary the site of the injection. So you might have one injection on the right side and the next injection on the left.
You usually have a stinging or dull ache for a short time, but they don’t usually hurt much."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/lanreotide-somatuline,Lanreotide (Somatuline),How often do you have lanreotide?,"You usually start having lanreotide injections every 2 to 4 weeks. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor might change the amount (dose) and length of time between your injections.
If you are having lanreotide to control the growth of your NET, you continue this for as long as it is working, and the side effects aren’t too bad."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cabazitaxel,Cabazitaxel (Jevtana),Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Lung problems
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Hair loss (complete hair loss)
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Joint or back pain
You might have pain in your back or joints. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Blood in your urine
This can be caused by different reasons, including infection. Tell your doctor if you see blood in your urine or have any pain.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting."

St John’s wort
St John’s wort is a herbal remedy used as a complementary therapy for mild to moderate depression. Let your doctor know if you are taking this.
Alcohol
Cabazitaxel contains a small amount of alcohol, equal to 14ml of beer or 6ml of wine. This medicine may be harmful for people with alcohol problems.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you want to have a baby in the future. You may be able to store sperm before starting treatment.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
You have the fluorouracil (5FU) through a small pump. The pump slowly puts the fluid into your bloodstream (infusion). You can keep the pump in a small bag or attach it to a belt. You’ll need to go back to the hospital after the second day of your treatment to have the pump removed. Or sometimes a chemotherapy nurse may be able to do it for you at home.
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
You usually stay in hospital as an inpatient if you have FOLFIRI through a cannula."

This means that you have the drug and then a rest to allow your body to recover.
Each cycle of treatment lasts 2 weeks (14 days). Depending on your needs, you may have up to 12 cycles, taking up to 6 months in total.
You have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
You have irinotecan through a drip into the bloodstream over 30 to 90 minutes (depending on which cycle you are having).
You have folinic acid through a drip into the bloodstream over 1 hour.
You have an injection of fluorouracil into the bloodstream over 5 minutes.
You have an infusion of 5FU through a drip or pump into the bloodstream for 46 hours.
Day 2
You continue to have the 5FU infusion.
Day 3

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Inflammation of the mouth, throat, food pipe and back passage
It may be painful to swallow drinks or food. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Other parts of the digestive system can also be affected. An inflamed food pipe (oesophagus) can cause heartburn. Inflammation of the back passage (rectum) can cause diarrhoea. Other symptoms are pain, bleeding and discharge and the feeling that you want to pass a bowel movement. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Acute cholinergic syndrome
Irinotecan can cause some people to develop a set of side effects during or within the first 24 hours after having the drug. These side effects include 
diarrhoea
 (which may be severe), sweating, stomach cramps, increased production of saliva, and watery eyes. You may have an injection of atropine before the irinotecan to reduce these side effects.
Diarrhoea can be severe. Contact your treatment centre straight away if you have diarrhoea within 24 hours of having irinotecan. You’ll need to have treatment.
Difficulty breathing
You may have difficulty breathing with wheezing and coughing. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
Raised uric acid levels in the blood
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels.
Changes in your heart rhythm
You may have changes to how your heart works. This can cause changes to your heart rhythm.
Your doctor might ask you to have tests to check your heart, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG).
It is rare but these drugs can cause other side effects such as a heart attack, lack of oxygen to the heart, inflammation of the heart muscle, an enlarged heart muscle or a heart not being able to pump enough blood (cardiac shock).
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms and soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Slow wound healing
Any wounds you might have can take longer to heal. Keep wounds clean to prevent infection. Contact your GP or specialist nurse if you are worried about a wound.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.

Phenytoin
Fluorouracil can raise the levels of phenytoin in your blood. You should have regular blood tests to prevent this from happening.
Sodium
This drug contains sodium (salt). You might need to take account of this if you are on a controlled sodium diet. Tell your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception

Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Low levels of DPD
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.

Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception you can use during treatment. Ask how long you should use it before starting treatment and after treatment has finished.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It is made up of the following drugs:
irinotecan (also called Campto) 
capecitabine (also called Xeloda)"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/xeliri,Irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI),How it works,"These chemotherapy drugs destroy quickly dividing cells, such as cancer cells."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/xeliri,Irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI),How you have it,"Irinotecan is a clear yellow fluid. You have it as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously).
Capecitabine comes as a tablet that you swallow whole, with plenty of water. You should take the tablets within 30 minutes of finishing a meal.
Your doctor will tell you which dose of capecitabine you need to take. You might have 2 different strengths of tablets to make up the correct dose. Take the tablets up to 30 minutes after a meal, with plenty of water.
Taking your tablets or capsules
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Whether you have a full or empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug.
Into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/xeliri,Irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI),When you have it,"You have irinotecan and capecitabine chemotherapy as cycles of treatment. Each cycle lasts 2 or 3 weeks.
You usually have it for as long as it controls your cancer.
2 week cycle
Day 1
You have irinotecan as a 30 minute drip into your bloodstream.
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 2 to 7
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 8 to 15
You have no treatment.
You then start your next treatment cycle.
3 week cycle
Day 1 
You have irinotecan as a 30 minute drip into your bloodstream.
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 2 to 14
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 15 to 21 
You have no treatment.
You then start your next treatment cycle."

It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your advice line or your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, such as a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C, or if you develop a severe skin reaction. Signs of a severe skin reaction include peeling or blistering of the skin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/xeliri,Irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI),Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Sweating
Talk to your doctor or nurse about this.
Making too much saliva
The drug atropine given before the irinotecan drip can help with this.
Watery eyes
Watery eyes
 is also called excessive tearing or epiphora (pronounced ep-if-or-ah). Tell your doctor or nurse if this is a problem for you. They can prescribe medicines to help. Try to avoid dust, pollen or animal hairs as they can make the watering worse.
Tummy (abdominal) cramps
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Sore mouth
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Soreness, redness and peeling on the hands and soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Blood clots
Blood clots
 can develop in the deep veins of your body, usually the leg. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), although this isn’t common.
Symptoms of a blood clot include:
•    pain, redness and swelling around the area where the clot is and may feel warm to touch
•    breathlessness
•    pain in your chest or upper back – dial 999 if you have chest pain
•    coughing up blood
Tell your doctor immediately or go to A&E if you have any symptoms of a blood clot."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 2 weeks after your final treatment. This is because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.

DPD deficiency
Around 5 out of 100 people (5%) have low levels of an enzyme called DPD in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine. It doesn’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. Contact your doctor if your side effects are severe."

Your blood contains different minerals and salts. This treatment can change the levels of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium in your blood.
Rarely, you might get high levels of mineral and salts in your blood due to the breakdown of tumour cells (tumour lysis syndrome). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Feeling short of breath (breathlessness)
You might feel breathless when doing your normal day to day activities or from climbing a short flight of stairs. There could be different causes for this. Call your advice line if you feel short of breath.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Lower than normal level of blood cells in your blood
Your blood tests might show a low number of red blood cells (anaemia), white blood cells (these help fight infection) or platelets (helps your blood clot).
You have regular blood tests to check your blood cell count levels."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with these drugs and for at least 5 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether these drugs come through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Fertility
It is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You need to keep your interferon in the fridge.
As an injection under the skin (subcutaneous)
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover: 
 Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin."

Depending on your needs, you may continue to have interferon alfa for a number of months."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/interferon,"Interferon alfa (IntronA, Roferon-A)",Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/interferon,"Interferon alfa (IntronA, Roferon-A)",Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Mood changes
You might have a change in your mood. Changes can include irritability, excitement, restlessness or depression.
Headaches and dizziness
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers. Don’t drive or operate machinery if you feel dizzy.
Dry mouth
A dry mouth
 is also called xerostomia (pronounced zero-stow-mee-a). Talk to your nurse or doctor if you have this. They can give you artificial saliva to help with a dry mouth. It can also help to drink plenty of fluids.
Blurred vision
Do not drive or operate machinery if you have this symptom and speak to your doctor.

Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Sore mouth
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Hair loss
Your 
hair may thin
 but you’re unlikely to lose all your hair. This usually starts after your first or second cycle of treatment. It is almost always temporary and your hair will grow back when you finish your treatment.
Sweating
Let your doctor know if you are sweating more than normal. They may be able to prescribe medicines to help. Cutting out alcohol and caffeine may help with sweating.
Pain in your muscles and joints
You might feel some pain from your muscles and joints. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Inflammation at the injection site
You might notice redness, swelling and pain around the area where you have had the injection.
Tiredness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Flu like symptoms
This can happen a few hours after treatment. It may include headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature and shivering. Taking paracetamol every 6 to 8 hours can help.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss."

Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception you can use during treatment. Ask how long you should use it before starting treatment and after treatment has finished.
Women must avoid becoming pregnant for at least 8 months after their last dose of inotuzumab.
Men must avoid fathering a child for at least 5 months after their last dose of inotuzumab.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 2 months afterwards. The drug may come through in the breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines at least 2 weeks before treatment, while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations
 - You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

It is a treatment for:
basal cell skin cancer (BCC)
a skin condition called actinic (solar) keratosis
Basal cell skin cancer (BCC)
Imiquimod cream is approved in the UK for the treatment of superficial basal cell skin cancers measuring up to 2cm across. It can be used on your chest, neck, arms or legs (including hands and feet). It is not approved for a type of BCC called nodular BCC.
Actinic (solar) keratosis
This skin condition might develop into squamous cell skin cancer. So you usually have treatment.
Melanoma
Occasionally, imiquimod is used as a treatment for melanoma skin cancer."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/imiquimod,Imiquimod cream (Aldara),How it works,"Imiquimod cream uses your body’s natural defences to help kill the skin cancer cells. It works by releasing a number of chemicals called cytokines. One of these cytokines is called interferon.
Interferon is a protein that the body makes as part of the immune response. Interferon is also used as a cancer treatment. It is thought that imiquimod makes cells produce more interferon which destroys the skin cancer cells."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/imiquimod,Imiquimod cream (Aldara),When you have it,"To treat BCC, you usually put imiquimod cream on to the affected area once a day, 5 days a week for 6 weeks. You usually leave the cream on the skin for about 8 hours. You shouldn't shower or bathe during this time."

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.

This treatment can irritate your bladder and kidneys. Drink as much water as possible to flush out the drugs. Make sure that you pass urine often, especially before you go to sleep. You might also have a drug called Mesna to protect your bladder and kidneys.
Changes in the levels of minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
You might also have a drug called allopurinol. It lowers the amount of uric acid in the blood and so helps to reduce the symptoms of gout."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You can empty the contents of the capsules into a glass of water if you have difficulty swallowing capsules. Then drink it all straight away. Don't leave any behind in the glass.
You can take hydroxycarbamide with or without food.
Taking your capsules
You must take capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug.
If you take more hydroxycarbamide than you should
Contact your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you forget to take hydroxycarbamide
Do not take the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Do not take a double dose to make up for the forgotten dose."

Risk of bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathless and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Loss of appetite

lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Inflammation of the lining of the gut and bowel
This can cause bleeding from your back passage when pooing and blood in your poo. It can also be very painful. Contact your advice line or tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of these symptoms.
Tummy (abdominal) discomfort or pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Skin and nail changes
Skin and nail problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin, itching and darker skin. Your nails may also become brittle, dry, change colour or develop ridges. This usually goes back to normal when you finish treatment.
Sore weak muscles
Your muscles might feel sore, weak and tired especially when climbing stairs, walking or getting out of a chair.
Problems passing urine
You might find it painful and difficult to pass urine. Contact your advice line or tell your doctor or nurse if this happens.

You might have G-CSF after chemotherapy to help your white blood cells recover after treatment. Or you might have it before and after a stem cell transplant.
There are different types of G-CSF, including:
lenograstim (Granocyte)
filgrastim (Neupogen, Zarzio, Nivestim, Accofil)
long acting (pegylated) filgrastim (pegfilgrastim, Neulasta, Pelmeg, Ziextenco) and lipegfilgrastim (Lonquex)
Pegylated G-CSF stays in the body for longer so you have treatment less often than with the other types of G-CSF. This type of G-CSF is not commonly used in the NHS."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/g-csf,Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),How G-CSF works,"Growth factors are proteins made in the body. Some of them make the bone marrow produce blood cells. G-CSF is a type of growth factor that makes the bone marrow produce more white blood cells so it can reduce the risk of infection after some types of cancer treatment.
G-CSF also makes some stem cells move from the bone marrow into the blood. Stem cells are very early cells that develop into red blood cells, white cells and platelets.
Before a stem cell transplant, you have G-CSF to stimulate the bone marrow to produce stem cells and release them into the blood. The stem cells are collected and then you have high dose chemotherapy.
The high dose of chemotherapy stops your bone marrow producing blood cells. So you have the stem cells infused back into your bloodstream. They go into the bone marrow and start making the different types of blood cells again."

Injection under your skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach, thigh or top of your arm.
You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover: 
 Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin.
Into your bloodstream
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment."

It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
You usually have G-CSF after chemotherapy, so it’s not always clear if the side effect are caused by G-CSF or chemotherapy.
The side effects listed below are for the G-CSF drug filgrastim."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/g-csf,Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF),Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10 %). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Bone or muscle pain
You might experience pain in your bones or muscles. Speak to your doctor as they can prescribe medicine to help.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Hair thinning
Your hair may thin but you’re unlikely to lose all 
your hair
. This usually starts after your first or second cycle of treatment. It is almost always temporary and your hair will grow back when you finish your treatment.
Sore mouth, throat, gut and back passage
It may be painful to swallow drinks or food . Or you might also have diarrhoea and pain if your bowel is inflammed.This can be caused by inflammation of the mucosa (thin lining of the internal organs).
Painkillers can help to reduce the soreness. And mouth washes can help keep your mouth healthy. There might also be numbing gel you could use for your back passage when having a poo.
Let your healthcare team know if you notice any of these symptoms."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gliadel,Gliadel (carmustine wafers),explain drug name,Gliadel is a wafer that contains the chemotherapy drug carmustine. Your brain surgeon (neurosurgeon) puts the wafer in during surgery to remove the brain tumour. It is a treatment for a brain tumour called glioblastoma multiforme (glioma) in adults.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gliadel,Gliadel (carmustine wafers),How it works,Gliadel wafers are small discs about the size of a 5p coin. The wafers release the chemotherapy drug carmustine as they dissolve. The carmustine in the wafer works by sticking to one of the cancer cell's DNA strands. The cell can't then divide into 2 new cells. This stops the cells growing and they die.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gliadel,Gliadel (carmustine wafers),How you have Gliadel,"Your brain surgeon puts the wafers in during brain surgery to remove some or all of the tumour. They put up to 8 wafers in the space where the tumour was. Over the next few days, the wafers slowly release the chemotherapy drug carmustine into this area."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gemcitabine,Gemcitabine (Gemzar) ,Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Flu like symptoms
This can happen a few hours after treatment. It may include headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature and shivering. Taking paracetamol every 6 to 8 hours can help.
Swelling in the face, hands and feet
This usually goes away on its own, but
 
tell your doctor or nurse if you have it.
Difficulty breathing
You may have difficulty breathing with wheezing and coughing. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
Blood and protein in your urine
Small amounts of blood and protein in your urine may be found when your nurse tests your urine. This usually goes away on its own. If there are large amounts of protein you may have tests to check how well your kidneys are working.
Skin rash
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before."

You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have problems swallowing the tablets.
Whether you have a full or an empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, no more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."

This means that you have the drugs and then a rest to allow your body to recover. Each cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks).
You may have GemCap for up to 6 treatment cycles. Or you have it for as long as it is working, and the side effects aren’t too bad.
How long you have it for will depend on your situation. Your healthcare team will tell you more about this.
You have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
You have gemcitabine as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 minutes.
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 2 to 7
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 8
You have gemcitabine as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 minutes. 
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 9 to 14
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 15
You have gemcitabine as a drip into your bloodstream over 30 minutes.
You take capecitabine tablets twice a day.
Day 16 to 21

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gemcap,Gemcitabine and capecitabine (GemCap),Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gemcap,Gemcitabine and capecitabine (GemCap),Side effects,"We haven't listed all the side effects. It is very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your advice line or your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, such as a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C, or if you develop a severe skin reaction. Signs of a severe skin reaction include peeling or blistering of the skin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gemcap,Gemcitabine and capecitabine (GemCap),Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Less often you might have bleeding from other areas of the body. Let your doctor or nurse know if this happens.
Tiredness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
You might also feel weak or lacking energy. This is called asthenia.
Flu like symptoms
This can happen a few hours after treatment. It may include headaches, muscle aches (myalgia), a high temperature and shivering. Talk to your nurse about this.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Soreness, redness, and peeling on palms and soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Diarrhoea can be severe, but it's usually well controlled with medicines.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Rarely, you might get yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice).
Blood in urine
This is called haematuria. You might have regular urine tests to check for this. Talk to your team if you see blood in your urine.
Fluid build up
A build up of fluid may cause swelling in your arms, hands, ankles, legs, face and other parts of the body. Contact your doctor if this happens to you.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Sore mouth and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Skin problems
Skin problems include an allergic skin rash, which is red and itchy.
Less often these drugs can make your skin dry and you might develop skin colour changes. Your skin might become more sensitive to sunlight and areas of skin that have been treated with radiotherapy in the past can become sore, irritated and inflamed.
Rarely you might develop a skin reaction that is serious and could be life threatening. It may start as tender red patches which leads to peeling or blistering of the skin. You might also feel feverish and your eyes may be more sensitive to light.
Let your healthcare team straight away. They can give you advice on what to do and what products you can use on your skin to help.
Difficulty breathing
You may have shortness of breath with wheezing and coughing. This could be the cause of different lung problems. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Nail problems
Your nails might break more easily, or slightly change colour."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/gemcap,Gemcitabine and capecitabine (GemCap),What else do I need to know?,"Low levels of DPD
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Other medicines, foods and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Lactose intolerance
Capecitabine contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Sodium
Gemcitabine contains sodium. If you have a sodium restricted diet, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether these drugs come through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/folfox,"Folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX)",Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Numbness and tingling (peripheral neuropathy)
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Feeling sick (nausea)
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Pain
You might have pain in your vein when you have your treatment. Tell your nurse straight away if you have any stinging, pain, redness or swelling around the vein. This could be due to the chemotherapy leaking into the tissue around the vein. This damages the tissue and needs quick treatment.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Allergic reaction to oxaliplatin
A mild or severe allergic reaction to oxaliplatin, mostly happens when you are having it. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel odd or strange, especially if you have difficulty breathing, a skin rash, chest pain or itchy eyes."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
DPD deficiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

LH blockers work by lowering the level of testosterone (the male sex hormone). It stops the release of lutenising hormone from the pituitary gland.
You need to take flutamide before you start some other types of hormone treatment because they can take a few weeks to lower your testosterone. During this time they can make your symptoms worse. This is called tumour flare.
If you are having flutamide to stop a flare reaction, you take it for a few days before starting the LH blocker, and stay on it for about 4 to 6 weeks."

You may be able to have the infusions of 5FU at home if you have a central line.
To have the 5FU at home, you need to have the infusions through a small pump. You can keep the pump in a small bag, or a bag on a belt (like a bum bag). You’ll need to go back to the hospital to have the pump changed or taken down. Or sometimes a chemotherapy nurse may be able to do this at your home.
Into your bloodstream
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment."

It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C or if you develop a severe skin reaction. Signs of a severe skin reaction include peeling or blistering of the skin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fluorouracil-mitomycin,Fluorouracil (5FU) and mitomycin C,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Difficulty breathing
You might have a sudden feeling of tightness in your chest, difficulty catching your breath, wheezing and a cough. This is caused by spasms in the muscles of your airways. Contact your healthcare advice line or tell your doctor.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after having this treatment.
Feeling weak
You might feel weak while having this treatment.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
A sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Inflammation of the digestive system
This treatment may cause inflammation of the 
digestive system
 
. This can cause pain and soreness.
It might include one or all of the following:
the throat 
the tummy (stomach) 
the back passage (rectum)
You can have painkillers to reduce the soreness. Take them half an hour before meals to make eating easier. Your nurse, doctor or dietician will explain the best foods to have if you have any of these symptoms.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Heart problems
You might have heart rhythm changes picked up on a heart trace (ECG). Less commonly it can cause chest pain. Other heart problems include a heart attack or problems with your heart muscle not working properly to pump blood around the body, but these are rare.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any chest pain.
Soreness, redness and peeling of palms and soles (hand foot syndrome)
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Raised uric acid levels in the blood
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels."

changes in the way your kidneys work -you have regular blood tests to check this
eye problems such as red, gritty, itchy, and watery eyes (conjunctivitis), rarely you might have rapid eye movement side to side, inflammation of the eyelids, blocked tear ducts, sensitivity to light, blurred or double vision, or eyelid turning outwards
redness, swelling or leaking at your drip site. Tell your nurse or doctor straight away if you notice this
skin problems such as a rash or skin that becomes dry and itchy (contact dermatitis), you might have increased sensitivity to sunlight, hives, or darkening of the skin, but this is rare."

an allergic reaction that can cause a rash, shortness of breath, redness or swelling of the face and dizziness
feeling happy and excited
shaking and trembling 
stiffness and slow movement (symptoms of Parkinson's disease)
headaches 
dizziness

Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Other medicines, foods and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)

Reactions during or after having rituximab
This can happen while having rituximab or within the next 24 hours. These include:
flu-like symptoms (high temperature, chills, muscle aches, tiredness, dizziness and headache)
low blood pressure
flushing
allergic reactions such as skin rashes, itching, feeling of swelling in the tongue or throat, irritation of the nasal passages, wheezing, coughing and breathlessness
They are most noticeable when you have your first treatment of rituximab. You will have medications beforehand to try and prevent a reaction.
General swelling
This most often affects the:
hands
feet
area around the eyes
lips and tongue
genitals
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Fever or chills
You might have a high temperature (fever). Or you might feel cold and shiver (chills). Tell your doctor or nurse they might be able to prescribe medication for this.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Low levels of an antibody called immunoglobulin G in your body
Immunoglobulin G is an antibody made by the immune system to fight bacteria and viruses. You have regular blood tests during and after treatment to check for this.
Cough
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have a cough.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Inflammation of the bladder
You might have pain when you pass urine. Or you may see blood when you pass urine. This is caused by inflammation of the bladder. Let your doctor know if this happens.
You should drink 8 to 12 cups of fluid a day to try to prevent this.
Feeling tired and lacking energy (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help."

Other medicines, food and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 12 months afterwards. The drug may come through in the breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover:
  Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin."

Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/folfirinox,FOLFIRINOX,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while
You might have difficulty swallowing or breathing that can be triggered by cold (such as cold air). This can start during the drip or up to a few hours after the infusion.
Tiredness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might lose your appetite for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Acute cholinergic syndrome
Irinotecan can cause some people to develop a set of side effects during or within the first 24 hours after having the drug. These side effects include diarrhoea (which may be severe), sweating, stomach cramps, increased production of saliva, and watery eyes. You may have an injection of atropine before the irinotecan to reduce these side effects.
Diarrhoea can be severe. Contact your treatment centre straight away if you have diarrhoea within 24 hours of having irinotecan. You’ll need to have treatment.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
You might also have inflammation of the food pipe (oesophagus) making it difficult and sore to swallow. Or inflammation and soreness of the back passage (anus).
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Eye changes
You might have 
eye problems
 including blurred vision, sore, red, itchy, dry eyes (conjunctivitis) or an infection. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can give you eye drops or other medication to help.
Less commonly you might have more tears than usual.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms or soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Numbness or tingling in the fingers and toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Heart problems
Heart problems include changes to how your heart works. This can cause changes to your heart rhythm and your ankles can swell.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any chest pain. Your doctor might ask you to have tests to check your heart, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Raised uric acid levels in the blood
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
DPD deficiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Sodium
Talk to your team if you are on a low sodium diet
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

mitoxantrone as a drip into your bloodstream
dexamethasone as tablets that you swallow whole, or as a drip into your bloodstream
Into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Speak to your pharmacist if you have problems swallowing the tablets.
Whether you have a full or an empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, no more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fmd,FMD,When you have FMD,"You usually have FMD as cycles of treatment. Each cycle of treatment lasts 4 weeks. You may have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1

Less commonly you might notice blood in your poo (stools) or wee (urine). Call your advice line if you have any signs of bleeding.
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
You usually have medicine to help prevent an allergic reaction at least 24 hours beforehand.
Some allergic reactions can be life-threatening alert your nurse or doctor if notice any of these symptoms.
High temperature and shivering
You might get a high temperature (fever) or a sudden feeling of cold with shivering with a rise in temperature (rigor).
Contact your advice line or healthcare team immediately if you have this.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
High blood sugar levels
High blood sugar levels can cause headaches, feeling thirsty and blurred vision. You have regular tests to check your blood sugar levels. You may need to check your levels more often if you are diabetic.
Changes in levels of salts or minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, such as low potassium and high sodium.
Less commonly you might have low levels of calcium in your blood. Symptoms include tingling in the lips, tongue, fingers and feet, muscle aches or spasms.
You have regular blood tests during treatment to check these levels.
Numbness of fingers and toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Increased sensitivity to the cold
Oxaliplatin can make you more sensitive to the cold. It can affect your throat causing it to feel as though it is difficult to breathe and swallow. This can happen whilst you have oxaliplatin or within 2 hours of it finishing. It’s only temporary but can feel quite frightening.
Opening and closing the fridge or freezer, touching metal, eating or drinking cold foods and changes in temperature from the weather can trigger this.
It can help wearing gloves and avoid very cold food and drink for 24 hours before and after oxaliplatin.
Let your nurse know straight away if it's affecting your breathing and swallowing.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Headaches
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers such as paracetamol to help.
Cough and shortness of breath
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are short of breath, have a tightening in your chest, wheeze or you have a cough. This could be due to spasms in the muscles of your airways or infection. Although rare, it could also be due to changes to the lung tissue, making it less flexible.
Contact your doctor straight away if you have sudden difficulty in breathing and a cough or high temperature.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Skin changes
Your skin may become red and sore or you may have an itchy rash. Less commonly your skin might become sensitive to sunlight, develop hives (raised, itchy rash), or areas of your skin might darken.
Tell your doctor if you have any rashes or itching. Don't go swimming if you have a rash because the chlorine in the water can make it worse.
If your skin gets dry or itchy, smoothing in unperfumed moisturising cream may help. Check with your doctor or nurse before using any creams or lotions. Wear a high factor sunblock if you’re going out in the sun.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Pain in your body
You might feel some pain from your body such as your back, tummy (abdomen), joints and bones. Speak to your doctor or nurse about what painkillers you can take to help with this.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Fluorouracil can cause liver cell damage, but this is rare.
Weight gain
You may gain weight while having this treatment. You may be able to control it with diet and exercise. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are finding it difficult to control your weight.
Soreness, redness and peeling on the palms and soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Slow wound healing
Any wounds you might have can take longer to heal. Keep wounds clean to prevent infection. Contact your GP or specialist nurse if you are worried about a wound.
Heart changes
You may have changes to how your heart works such as your heart rhythm. Tests such as a 
heart trace (ECG)
 
 might pick this up. Less often you might get chest pain. Let your healthcare team know if this happens. Your doctor will make sure it is safe for you to have treatment.
It is rare but these drugs can cause other side effects such as a heart attack, lack of oxygen to the heart, inflammation of the heart muscle, an enlarged heart muscle or the heart not being able to pump enough blood (cardiac shock).
An increase in the level of uric acid in your blood
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels.
Swelling of your hands, legs and feet
Swelling of the hands, legs and feet is due to fluid build up. This is called oedema. You might also notice a build up of fluid in other areas of the body.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any swelling.
Inflammation and pain at or near the drip site
When you're having treatment into your bloodstream through a 
cannula
 
 tell your nurse straight away if you have any redness, swelling, pain or discomfort at or nearby to your drip site during the infusion."

Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Other medicines, foods and drinks
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Phenytoin
Fluorouracil can raise the levels of phenytoin in your blood. You should have regular blood tests to prevent this from happening.
Sodium
Fluorouracil contains sodium (salt). You might need to take account of this if you are on a controlled sodium diet. Tell your doctor if you are on a low salt diet.
Alcohol
Docetaxel contains small amounts of alcohol. This is not harmful to most people but maybe if you have liver disease, epilepsy or suffer from alcohol problems.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether these drugs come through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/fec,FEC,How often do you have FEC?,"You have FEC chemotherapy as 
cycles of treatment
 
. This means you have the drugs and then a rest to allow your body to recover.
Each cycle of treatment lasts 3 weeks. You usually have up to 6 cycles of treatment.
You have all 3 drugs on the first day of each 3 week cycle.
You might also have an injection of a drug called G-CSF. This is a type of

It is also known by its brand name Aromasin. You might have it as a treatment for breast cancer after you have had the menopause.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/exemestane-aromasin,Exemestane (Aromasin),How exemestane works,"Many breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the female sex hormones oestrogen and progesterone. These breast cancers are called hormone sensitive or hormone receptor positive. Blocking the effects of these hormones can treat breast cancer.
In women who have had their menopause, oestrogen is mainly produced by changing androgens (sex hormones produced by the adrenal glands) into oestrogens. This process is called aromatisation and happens mainly in the fatty tissues, muscle and skin. It needs a particular enzyme called aromatase.
Exemestane blocks the process of aromatisation. So it lowers the amount of oestrogen in the body. In early breast cancer, taking exemestane can help to stop breast cancer coming back. In advanced breast cancer, the cancer cells may grow more slowly or stop growing completely."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Do not take hormone replacement therapy while you are having exemestane treatment.
The following medicines should be used cautiously when taking exemestane. Let your doctor know if you are taking medicines such as:
rifampicin (an antibiotic)
carbamazepine or phenytoin (anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy)
St John’s wort - a herbal remedy used as a complementary therapy for mild to moderate depression
Sugar intolerance
This drug contains a type of sugar called sucrose. Tell your doctor if you have an intolerance to any type of sugar.
Pregnancy and contraception
Exemestane might harm a developing baby in the womb. It’s important to use contraception while taking this drug if it’s unclear if you have been through the menopause or you are taking drugs to stop your periods. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception. They can tell you how long to carry on using contraception after you stop taking exemestane.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems."

It is a treatment for children and young people up to the age of 21 years with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is used when the leukaemia has come back after at least two other treatments.
Researchers are also looking at it as a treatment for:
older people with acute myeloid leukaemia who can’t have high dose treatment with a stem cell transplant
people with myelodysplastic syndrome"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/clofarabine,Clofarabine (Evoltra),How clofarabine works,"Clofarabine is a type of chemotherapy drug known as an anti metabolite. Anti metabolites stop cells making DNA, which is the genetic material of the cell. Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA so that they can grow and multiply."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/clofarabine,Clofarabine (Evoltra),How you have clofarabine,"You have clofarabine into your bloodstream (intravenously).
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/clofarabine,Clofarabine (Evoltra),When you have clofarabine,"You have clofarabine as a drip for 2 hours each day for 5 days. You also have extra fluids through the drip to help stop the build up of uric acid. Uric acid can build up in the body when cancer cells are broken down. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine called allopurinol to lower blood levels of uric acid.
After the 5 days, you have a break from treatment of 2 to 6 weeks. This makes up a treatment cycle. You might have clofarabine with other treatments.
Once your level of blood cells goes back to normal you have the next cycle of treatment. The number of cycles of treatment you have depends on your treatment plan and how well the treatment works."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/clofarabine,Clofarabine (Evoltra),Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment.

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Skin rash
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Soreness, redness and peeling on hands and soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Mood changes (such as anxiety)
You might feel more worried or panicky than usual. Talk to your doctor or nurse about this if you do.
Skin flushing

Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

 can develop in the deep veins of your body, usually the leg. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), although this isn’t common.
Symptoms of a blood clot include:
•    pain, redness and swelling around the area where the clot is and may feel warm to touch
•    breathlessness
•    pain in your chest or upper back – dial 999 if you have chest pain
•    coughing up blood
Tell your doctor immediately or go to A&E if you have any symptoms of a blood clot.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Inflammation of the pancreas
This drug can cause inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis). Tell your doctor straight away if you have sudden and severe pain in your tummy (abdomen).
An allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
High levels of pancreatic and liver enzymes
You might have changes in the levels of pancreatic and liver enzymes such as amylase and lipase. You have regular blood tests during treatment to check for this.
High blood sugar levels
High blood sugar levels can cause headaches, feeling thirsty and blurred vision. You have regular tests to check your blood sugar levels. You may need to check your levels more often if you are diabetic.
Changes to the way your blood clots
You may have changes to the way your blood clots which can cause bleeding and bruising.
Low levels of albumin in your body
Albumin is an important protein in your body. Low levels of albumin can cause weakness, muscle cramps and swelling in different parts of your body. You have regular blood tests to check the albumin levels.
High levels of bilirubin
You might have high levels of bilirubin in your blood. You will have regular blood tests to check the bilirubin levels.
High blood cholesterol
Cholesterol is a fatty substance which helps cells in the body to work normally. When the cholesterol level is too high it could have an effect on your heart. You usually have blood tests to check your cholesterol levels.
Skin rash
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Tiredness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting."

Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.

 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Kidney changes
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Redness, soreness and peeling on hands or soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.

Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms or soles of the feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Heart problems
You may get heart problems, such as angina, heart failure or a heart attack. You will have regular heart checks during and after the treatment. Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have any chest pain.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Kidney problems
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for 2 weeks after your final treatment. This is because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy.
Lactose intolerance
This drug contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
DPD deficiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/epirubicin,Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin),explain drug name,Epirubicin is a chemotherapy drug and its brand name is Pharmorubicin (pronounced farm-oh-roo-bis-in). It is a treatment for many different types of cancer.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/epirubicin,Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin),How epirubicin works,Epirubicin belongs to a group of chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines. They damage the DNA (genetic code) in cancer cells. This stops the cancer cells from dividing or growing.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/epirubicin,Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin),How you have it,"For most types of cancer you have epirubicin into your bloodstream (intravenously). For bladder cancer, you might have it given directly into the bladder. Epirubicin is a red liquid.
Into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
Into your bladder
You can have epirubicin directly into your bladder (intravesical chemotherapy). It’s used to treat some types of early bladder cancer.
Your doctor or specialist nurse puts the epirubicin through a flexible tube called a catheter, which goes into your bladder. They then remove the catheter. Avoid passing urine for the next 1 to 2 hours. This gives the chemotherapy time to be in contact with the lining of your bladder."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/epirubicin,Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin),When you have epirubicin,"When you have epirubicin depends on your cancer type. You usually have it in cycles of treatment that last 3 weeks. A cycle means that you have epirubicin, or epirubicin in combination with other cancer drugs, and then have some time with no treatment.
It can take up to 30 minutes if you have it on its own but it might take longer if you have it with other drugs.
For bladder cancer, you might have epirubicin every week, for up to 8 weeks."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/epirubicin,Epirubicin (Pharmorubicin),Tests,"You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
You might also have tests to check how well your heart is working. Epirubicin can weaken the heart. This isn’t very common, but doctors need to know how well your heart is working before you start."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when you are taking encorafenib because it can react with the drug and make side effects worse.
Lactose intolerance
Binimetinib contains lactose (milk sugar). Contact your doctor before taking this medicine if you have an intolerance to lactose.
Driving and use of machinery
This drug can cause tiredness and dizziness. Don’t drive or operate heavy machinery if you have these symptoms.
Fertility
It is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether these drugs come through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a month afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
If you are taking hormonal contraceptives like the pill, you should also use another barrier method such as a condom. This is because encorafenib affects how well hormonal contraceptives work.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eshap,ESHAP,explain drug name,"ESHAP is the name of a cancer drug combination that includes:
E – etoposide
S – solu-medrone (also called methylprednisolone, which is a steroid) 
HA – high dose cytarabine, also known as Ara C
P – cisplatin (which is a type of platinum chemotherapy)
It is a treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and myeloma. It is usually used before having a stem cell transplant.
For some types of NHL, you might also have ESHAP with a drug called rituximab. This is called R-ESHAP."

You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eshap,ESHAP,When you have it,"You usually have ESHAP as cycles of treatment. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks (21 days). Depending on your needs, you might have between 1 and 6 cycles of treatment.
You usually have each treatment cycle in the following way:
Day 1
You have cisplatin as a drip into your bloodstream continuing for 4 days
You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream for 1 hour 
You have methylprednisolone as a drip into your bloodstream for 15 to 30 minutes 
You have cytarabine as a drip into your bloodstream for 2 hours
Day 2 to 4
You have cisplatin as a continuous drip into your bloodstream
You have etoposide as a drip into your bloodstream for 1 hour 
You have methylprednisolone as a drip into your bloodstream for 15 to 30 minutes
Day 5
You have methylprednisolone as a drip into your bloodstream for 15 to 30 minutes 
Your cisplatin drip finishes
Day 6 to 21 
You have no treatment
You stay in hospital during the 5 days of treatment. You will be able to move around the ward even when the drip is going through. You also have fluids (hydration) during treatment. This is because ESHAP can cause kidney damage and the extra fluids help to keep your kidneys working properly.
Your doctor or nurse might also give you steroid eye drops to use for a few days. This helps to stop your eyes from getting sore."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eshap,ESHAP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eshap,ESHAP,Common side effects,"Each of these effects happens in more than 1 in 10 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Hearing changes
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Low blood pressure
Tell your doctor or nurse if you feel light headed or dizzy. You have your blood pressure checked regularly.
Sore and red eyes
Sore, red eyes can happen because cytarabine is partly removed from your body (excreted) in your tears. You will have steroid eye drops to help prevent sore eyes.
Low levels of sodium in your body
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, such as low sodium. This will most likely go back to normal when you finish treatment. You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
High levels of uric acid in your body
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause a type of arthritis known as gout. You’ll have regular blood tests to check these levels.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help."

Blood clots
Blood clots
 can develop in the deep veins of your body, usually the leg. This is called deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A blood clot can be very serious if it travels to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), although this isn’t common.
Symptoms of a blood clot include:
•    pain, redness and swelling around the area where the clot is and may feel warm to touch
•    breathlessness
•    pain in your chest or upper back – dial 999 if you have chest pain

Tummy (abdominal) and back pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can work out the cause and give you medicine to help relieve the pain.
Sore mouth and ulcers
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Numbness and tingling in fingers and toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can usually improve slowly after you finish treatment. Talk to the team looking after you when you first notice this, especially if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Increased sensitivity to the cold
Oxaliplatin can make you more sensitive to the cold. It can affect your throat causing it to feel as though it is difficult to breathe and swallow. This can happen whilst you have oxaliplatin or within 2 hours of it finishing. It’s only temporary but can feel quite frightening.
Opening and closing the fridge or freezer, touching metal, eating or drinking cold foods and changes in temperature from the weather can trigger this.
It can help wearing gloves and avoid very cold food and drink for 24 hours before and after oxaliplatin.
Let your nurse know straight away if it's affecting your breathing and swallowing.
Hair thinning and loss
Your hair may thin or you could 
lose all your hair

diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms and soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Let your doctor or nurse know as you may be able to have creams to help manage this.
Skin and nail problems
Skin and nail problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin, itching and darker skin. Your nails may also become brittle, dry, change colour or develop ridges. This usually goes back to normal when you finish treatment.
Skin flushing
Your skin may redden and appear flushed.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Inflammation around the drip or injection site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Also let them know if it causes pain along the vein when you have the injection.
Allergic reactions
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after treatment.
Changes to your periods
Women might stop having periods (amenorrhoea) but this may be temporary. This is a side effect from the chemotherapy only.
Eye problems
You might have eye problems, including watery eyes, irritation and redness (conjunctivitis).  Other less common symptoms include blurred or double vision and eye pain.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with your eyes. They can give you eye drops to help.
Indigestion or heartburn
Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have indigestion or heartburn. They can prescribe medicines to help.
Cough or breathing problems
You might develop a cough or difficulty breathing due to an infection such as pneumonia. Or it can just be due to the drugs. Let your team know immediately if this happens.
Weight gain
You may gain weight while having this treatment. You may be able to control it with diet and exercise. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are finding it difficult to control your weight.
Changes to the way your liver works

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eox,EOX,What else do I need to know?,"DPD deficiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Other medicines, foods and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Lactose intolerance
Capecitabine contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eof,EOF,How you have EOF,"You have all EOF drugs into your bloodstream (intravenously).
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
You have the 5FU through a small pump. The pump slowly puts the fluid into your bloodstream (infuses). You can keep the pump in a small bag or attached it to a belt. You'll need to go back to the hospital every 7 days during your treatment to have the pump changed. Or sometimes a chemotherapy nurse may be able to do it for you at home."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eof,EOF,When you have EOF,"You usually have EOF chemotherapy as cycles of treatment. This means that you have the drugs and then a rest to allow your body to recover.
Each cycle of treatment lasts 21 days (3 weeks). Depending on your needs, you may have up to 8 cycles, taking between 4 and 6 months in total.
You have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1 
You have epirubicin as an injection into your vein.
You have oxaliplatin as a drip into your vein over 2 hours.
You have fluorouracil (5FU) as a continuous drip through a portable pump.
Day 2 to 21
You have fluorouracil (5FU) as a continuous drip through a portable pump (you have the pump changed on day 8 and day 15).
You then start your next cycle of treatment."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eof,EOF,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eof,EOF,Side effects,"We haven't listed all the side effects. It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/eof,EOF,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Difficulty swallowing or breathing due to cold air
Oxaliplatin can make you more sensitive to the cold. It can affect your throat causing it to feel as though it is difficult to breathe and swallow. This can happen whilst you have oxaliplatin or within 2 hours of it finishing. It’s only temporary but can feel quite frightening.
Opening and closing the fridge or freezer, touching metal, eating or drinking cold foods and changes in temperature from the weather can trigger this.
It can help wearing gloves and avoid very cold food and drink for 24 hours before and after oxaliplatin.
Let your nurse know straight away if it's affecting your breathing and swallowing.
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse might give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction.
Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while.
Difficulty breathing or a cough
It is important to tell your doctor or nurse if you have a cough, or are breathless.
More rarely lung changes such as stiffening of the lungs can cause breathing problems too.
Eye problems
You might have eye problems, such as inflammation of the white tissue of your eye (pink eye or conjunctivitis). Symptoms include itchy, watery or gritty eyes. Or you might have inflammation of the clear, dome shaped tissue on the front of your eye (keratitis). Symptoms include pain, blurred vision, watery eyes and sensitivity to light.
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any problems with your eyes. They can give you eye drops to help.
More rarely you might have eyes moving quickly from side to side (nystagmus), blocked tear ducts, an eyelid turning outwards, double vision or temporary loss of vision.
Hot flushes
We have some tips for 
coping with hot flushes
 and the possible treatments for men and women. Talk to your doctor if your hot flushes are hard to cope with. They might be able to prescribe you some medicines.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Sore mouth and throat and other parts of the digestive system
It may be painful to swallow drinks or food. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Other parts of the digestive system can also be affected. An inflamed food pipe (oesophagus) can cause heartburn. Inflammation of the back passage (rectum) can cause diarrhoea. Other symptoms are pain, bleeding and discharge and the feeling that you want to pass a bowel movement. Speak to your doctor or nurse if you have these symptoms.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Skin changes
You might notice skin changes, such as dryness, itching, rashes or areas of skin which differ in appearance and are raised like bumps.
Tell your healthcare team if you have any rashes or problems with your skin and nails. They might be able to give you something to help like a cream or lotion.
Occasionally these drugs can cause your skin to get flaky and your skin might change colour. So, they might get darker or lighter.
More rarely EOF can cause your skin to get red, crack, blister, ooze, crust and you might develop a sudden rash that’s raised, red and itchy (hives). Your skin might also be sensitive to the sun so you may burn easily. Wear a high factor sun block if you're going out in the sun.
Hair thinning and hair loss
You may have some
 hair loss or hair thinning
. This can be upsetting. Your hair might grow back once treatment has finished.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Periods stopping
Women might stop having periods (amenorrhoea) but this may be temporary.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after taking this drug.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
5FU can cause liver cell damage, but this is rare.
Inflammation of the bladder (cystitis)
Inflammation of the bladder causes a burning feeling when passing urine and the need to pass urine often. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this and try to drink plenty of fluids.
Occasionally you might have blood in your urine.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
High blood sugar levels
High blood sugar levels can cause headaches, feeling thirsty and blurred vision. You have regular tests to check your blood sugar levels. You may need to check your levels more often if you are diabetic.
Changes to the levels of minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, such as low potassium and high sodium. You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Occasionally you might have low levels of calcium in the blood. You have regular blood tests to check this.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Headaches
Let your doctor or nurse know if you have headaches. They can give you painkillers such as paracetamol to help.
Tummy (abdominal) cramps
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Occasionally you might have inflammation of the lining of the stomach or a stomach ulcer.
Back pain
You might have back pain. Speak to your doctor if this is a problem for you. They can prescribe medicine to help.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
High levels of enzymes in the blood
You might have higher than usual levels of an enzyme called blood lactate dehydrogenase in your blood. Body tissues release blood lactate dehydrogenase when damaged.
Weight changes
You may gain weight while having this treatment. You may be able to control it with diet and exercise. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are finding it difficult to control your weight.
Less commonly you might lose weight.
Raised uric acid levels in the blood
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels.
Changes in how your heart works
You may have changes to how your heart works. This can cause changes to your heart rhythm and how well it is able to pump blood around your body. Symptoms that your heart is not working properly might include breathlessness when resting or after an activity; feeling tired and lacking energy most of the time and swollen ankles and legs.
Your doctor might ask you to have tests to check your heart, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Occasionally people experience chest pain when the heart muscle does not get the blood it needs.
It is rare but these drugs can cause other side effects like a heart attack, lack of oxygen to the heart, inflammation of the heart muscle, an enlarged heart muscle or a heart not being able to pump enough blood (cardiac shock).
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms and soles of feet
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Slow wound healing
Any wounds you might have can take longer to heal. Keep wounds clean to prevent infection. Contact your GP or specialist nurse if you are worried about a wound."

Drugs into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ec,EC,When you have EC,"You usually have EC chemotherapy as a course of several cycles of treatment. This means that you have the drugs and then a rest to allow your body to recover.
You have both drugs every 2 to 3 weeks and then a break with no treatment. You have between 3 and 6 cycles, taking 3 to 4 months in total.
The treatment usually takes just over an hour each time however you may be at the hospital for longer."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ec,EC,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Pink or red urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Periods stopping
This might only be temporary. Talk to the team looking after you about this.
Blood in urine (haemorrhagic cystitis)
You might have pain when you pass urine. Or you may see blood when you pass urine. This is caused by inflammation of the bladder. Let your doctor know if this happens.
You should drink 8 to 12 cups of fluid a day to try to prevent this.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after taking this drug.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your treatment team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Hot flushes
We have some tips for coping with hot flushes and the possible treatments. Talk to your doctor if your hot flushes are hard to cope with. They might be able to prescribe you some medicine.
Skin changes
This might include a rash, itching or changes to the colour of skin or nails (pigmentation).
Sore mouth
This might be caused by mucosal inflammation in the mouth.
Eye problems
This might include inflammation of the conjunctiva (conjunctivitis) or inflammation of the cornea (keratitis).
Liver changes
You will have regular blood tests to check for this.
Swelling of the veins (phlebitis)

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drug may come through into your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
If you have had radiotherapy
Tell your doctor if you have had radiotherapy treatment to your chest that might have been near to or involving your heart. This could increase the risk of heart damage from doxorubicin and your doctor will need to take this into account.
Rarely you might have skin changes in an area where you have had radiotherapy. Talk to your team about this.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Sore mouth and throat
It may be 
painful to swallow drinks or food
. Painkillers and mouth washes can help to reduce the soreness and keep your mouth healthy.
Fatigue
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Taste changes
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes.
Headaches
Tell your doctor or nurse if you keep getting headaches. They can give you painkillers to help.
Difficulty sleeping
It can help to change a few things about how you try to sleep. Try to go to bed and get up at the same time each day and spend some time relaxing before you go to bed. Some light exercise each day may also help.
Hearing changes
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.
Fluid build up
You may have swelling of your hands and legs due to a build up of fluid (oedema).
Lung problems
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons."

Low levels of DPD
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/diamorphine,Diamorphine,How you have diamorphine,"You can have diamorphine in a number of different ways. You might have it as:
an injection under your skin (subcutaneous)
an injection into your vein (intravenous)
as tablets that you swallow whole
The dose you have depends on the amount of pain you have. You usually start by having a low dose. And your doctor or nurse will gradually adjust the dose depending on your needs.
As an injection under the skin
You usually have diamorphine as an injection into the fatty tissue just under the skin. This might be in your thigh, stomach or upper arm. You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this injection but they don't usually hurt much. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.
Some people have diamorphine through a small needle put under the skin and connected to a pump called a syringe driver. The pump gives you a small amount of diamorphine continuously. A nurse changes the pump every 24 to 48 hours.
As an injection into your vein
You might have diamorphine into your bloodstream. You usually have it through a thin, short tube (a cannula) put into a vein in your arm or the back of your hand. Or you may have it through a central line, a portacath or a PICC line. These are long, plastic tubes that give the drug directly into a large vein in your chest.
Find out more about central lines
Taking your tablets
You must take tablets according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you. You should take the right dose, no more or less.
If you have too much diamorphine
Having too much diamorphine can cause severe breathing and heart changes. You should only take the dose of diamorphine prescribed by your doctor or nurse. Talk to your specialist team if you think you need a higher dose of painkillers.
Go to your local accident and emergency (A&E) department if you have taken too much diamorphine and have slower breathing, low blood pressure and unconsciousness. Doctors may give you a drug called naloxone to stop the effects of diamorphine."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/daunorubicin,Daunorubicin ,Possible side effects,"You might have one or more of these side effects:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Allergic reaction
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They can give you medicine to help.
Not enough fluid in your body (dehydration)
If you are dehydrated you might find you aren't passing much urine and the colour is a very dark yellow. Your skin might be very dry and you might feel dizzy. So make sure you drink around 2 litres of fluid every day. Tell your nurse or doctor if you are not able to drink this much.
High uric acid levels
High uric acid levels in the blood are due to the breakdown of tumour cells (tumour lysis syndrome). You have regular blood tests to check your uric acid levels and you may take a tablet called allopurinol. Drinking plenty helps to flush out the excess uric acid.
Inflammation around your drip site
Tell your nurse straight away if you have any pain, redness, swelling or leaking around your drip site.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Sore mouth
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Red or pink urine
This won't harm you. It’s due to the colour of the chemotherapy and lasts for one or two days.
Facial flushing
The skin on your face may appear red (flushed), and you may feel warm at the same time. This can happen at the same time as you have the medicine into your bloodstream. This is temporary.
Skin changes
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Diarrhoea

diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Inflammation of your food pipe and bowel
This drug can cause inflammation of your food pipe (oesophagus) and bowel. Symptoms that your food pipe might be inflamed include difficulty and painful swallowing, heartburn or indigestion, food getting stuck, chest pain that’s worse when eating, feeling or being sick.
Symptoms of inflammation of the bowel include feeling bloated or swollen, loose or watery poo, being sick and blood in your poo.
Talk to your treatment team if you have any of these symptoms.
Periods stopping
You might stop having periods (amenorrhoea) but this may be temporary. Your periods usually start again within 6 to 12 months of your treatment finishing.
If you are close to the menopause age, your periods may not come back.
No sperm in semen
Talk to your treatment team if you are planning to father a child after treatment. You may be able to 
store some of your sperm
 before you start treatment.
Heart problems

Changes in the brain
Changes in the brain that are usually reversible, causing a sudden onset of symptoms including headaches, dizziness, confusion, fits (seizures) and changes to vision (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome).
Contact your healthcare team straight away if you have any of these symptoms.
Kidney changes (nephrotic syndrome)
Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms that show there are changes to how well your kidneys are working. You may have large amounts of protein in your urine and low amounts in your blood. You may also have a build up of fluid in your body, usually in your feet, ankles and legs. Your nurse regularly checks your urine for protein while you are having treatment.
Second cancers
There is a very small risk that you may get a second cancer, such as leukaemia, some years after this treatment. Your doctor will discuss this with you."

 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
This usually happens a few hours after having treatment.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Difficulty swallowing
Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you have any problems swallowing.
Fatigue
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Liver problems
This includes inflammation of the liver and changes to the levels of liver enzymes. You have regular blood tests to check for this.
You may also develop a condition in which some of the veins in the liver are blocked. This may cause liver damage and can be life threatening.
A build up of fluid in your tummy (abdomen)
This is called ascites. You may notice that your clothes feel tighter and your tummy feels bloated. You might also find it difficult to sit comfortably or to move around. Tell your doctor if you think you have this.
Low levels of calcium in your body
Low calcium levels in the blood can cause painful muscle spasms, cramps or muscle twitching. You might also get numbness or tingling in your feet, hands or around your mouth.
Inflammation of the lungs
This drug can cause inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor know if you have breathlessness, a high temperature and chills, extreme tiredness, a dry cough, or pain in your lungs when you take a deep breath.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Skin changes
You might notice 
skin changes
, such as dryness, itching and rashes similar to acne on your face, neck and trunk.
Tell your doctor if you have any rashes or itching. Don't go swimming if you have a rash because the chlorine in the water can make it worse.
If your skin gets dry or itchy, using unperfumed moisturising cream may help. Check with your doctor or nurse before using any creams or lotions. Wear a high factor sun block if you’re going out in the sun.
You might also have soreness, a burning feeling, and dry skin in the areas treated with radiotherapy in the past.
Some people have also developed a severe skin reaction that starts as tender red patches and leads to peeling or blistering of the skin. You might also feel feverish and your eyes may be more sensitive to light. This is serious and could be life threatening.
Muscle pain
You might have muscle pain during treatment. Let your treatment team know so they can advise you on how to reduce it.
Inflammation at your drip site
When you're having treatment into your bloodstream tell your nurse straight away if you have any redness, swelling, pain or leaking at your drip site."

Whether you have a full or an empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, no more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/dhap,DHAP,When you have it,"You usually have DHAP chemotherapy as cycles of treatment. You may have between 2 and 6 cycles and each cycle lasts 3 weeks.
You have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
You have cisplatin as a drip into your vein (intravenously) for up to 24 hours
You start taking dexamethasone tablets or have dexamethasone into your vein
Day 2 
You have cytarabine (Ara C) as a drip into your vein, twice. Each drip lasts for 2 to 3 hours and you have them 12 hours apart
You take dexamethasone tablets or have dexamethasone into your vein
If you have the dexamethasone as tablets you will be able to go home and carry on taking the tablets at home. If you have the dexamethasone into your vein, you will need to go back to the hospital for 2 more days.
Day 3 and 4
You take dexamethasone tablets or have dexamethasone into your vein
Day 5 to 21
You have no treatment
You then start the next cycle.
Drugs to help with the side effects
You have fluids (hydration) into your vein during your first two days of treatment. This is because DHAP can cause kidney damage and the extra fluids help to keep your kidneys working properly. You may also take a drug called allopurinol on your first cycle of treatment. This is to help keep the levels of uric acid in your blood stable.
Your doctor will give you steroid eye drops to take for 5 to 7 days. The drops help to stop your eyes getting sore."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/dhap,DHAP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/dhap,DHAP,Side effects,"We haven't listed all the side effects. It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/dhap,DHAP,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (more than 10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Risk of bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Sore anus
Your anus could become inflamed, sore and develop ulcers. This can be painful. Contact your advice line or talk to your doctor or nurse if this happens.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Changes to how your liver works
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Cytarabine syndrome
This can happen about 6 to 12 hours after having cytarabine.
It is a combination of symptoms including a high temperature, aching muscles, bone pain, occasionally chest pain, a rash, sore eyes, and extreme weakness. You have steroids to help to prevent this syndrome. Contact your advice line or tell your doctor or nurse if this happens.
Skin problems
Skin problems
 include a skin rash, dry skin and itching. This usually goes back to normal when your treatment finishes. Your nurse will tell you what products you can use on your skin to help.
Less common you could also get skin ulcers.
With high dose cytarabine your skin might also peel.
High temperature
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Low level of sodium in the blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, such as low sodium. This will most likely go back to normal when you finish treatment. You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Feeling sleepy (drowsy)
High doses of cytarabine can make you drowsy.
Changes to how you think and feel
High dose cytarabine can:
make you feel confused
cause slurred speech
affect your level of consciousness making you sleepy or not alert
Contact your advice line or tell your doctor or nurse if you or someone else notice these changes.
Eye problems
High dose cytarabine can cause eye problems.
You might have 
eye problems
 including blurred vision, sore, red, itchy, dry eyes (conjunctivitis) or an infection. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can give you eye drops or other medication to help.
Lung and breathing problems
High dose cytarabine can cause a life threatening syndrome called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Symptoms are:
severe shortness of breath
rapid, shallow breathing
tiredness, drowsiness or confusion
feeling faint
You might also get fluid on the lung which can cause difficulty breathing.
Contact your advice line or tell your doctor or nurse if you have any of these symptoms."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

into your bloodstream (intravenously)
just under the skin (subcutaneously)
into your spinal fluid (intrathecal injection)
Drugs into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
Injection under your skin
You usually have injections under the skin (subcutaneous injection) into the stomach or thigh. You might have stinging or a dull ache for a short time after this type of injection. The skin in the area may go red and itchy for a while.
Chemotherapy into the spinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy)
You might have chemotherapy injected into the fluid around the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF). This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.
Your doctor gives you the drug during a procedure called lumbar puncture. The drug mixes with the cerebrospinal fluid and circulates through the brain."

Many medicines can react with cabozantinib.
Don’t eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while having treatment with cabozantinib. It can change the amount of cabozantinib you absorb and make the side effects worse.
This drug contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, talk to your doctor before taking this medication.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This drug may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 4 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment and for at least 4 months afterwards. The drug may come through in the breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy.
Driving and using machines
Be careful when driving or using machines. This drug can make you feel tired or weak and can affect your ability to drive or use machines."

Cisplatin and fluorouracil are chemotherapy drugs, and trastuzumab (Herceptin) is a targeted drug called a monoclonal antibody.
You might have cisplatin, fluorouracil and trastuzumab as a treatment for stomach cancer that:
has spread to another part of the body (advanced)
has large amounts of HER2 protein (HER2 positive)"

Into your bloodstream
You have the treatment through a drip into your arm or hand. A nurse puts a small tube (a cannula) into one of your veins and connects the drip to it.
You might need a central line. This is a long plastic tube that gives the drugs into a large vein, either in your chest or through a vein in your arm. It stays in while you’re having treatment, which may be for a few months.
Find out about central lines
If you have a central line, you might be able to have fluorouracil through a small pump which slowly puts the fluid into your bloodstream (infusion). You can keep the pump in a small bag or attached to a belt. When the fluorouracil infusion finishes, the nurse blocks the end of the central line with a plastic cap until the start of your next treatment. A district nurse or chemotherapy nurse may be able to do this at home."

First, you have 6 cycles of treatment with cisplatin and fluorouracil. You have each cycle of treatment in the following way:
Day 1
You have cisplatin as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously)
You have trastuzumab as a drip into your bloodstream 
You have an infusion of fluorouracil through a drip or a pump into your bloodstream
Day 2 to 5
You continue with fluorouracil as a drip or a pump into your bloodstream
Day 6 to 21
You have no treatment
You then start a new cycle of treatment. You might also have fluids into your bloodstream for a few hours before and after each cisplatin treatment. The extra fluids help to protect your kidneys.
After 6 cycles of treatment with cisplatin, trastuzumab and fluorouracil, you continue trastuzumab alone.
This continues for as long as the treatment is helping you and the side effects aren't too bad."

You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired

Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Changes to your hearing
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes.

High temperature (fever)
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Changes in levels of minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Lung problems
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs (pneumonitis). Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become breathless or develop a cough.
Heart problems
Heart problems include changes to how your heart works. This can cause changes to your heart rhythm and your ankles can swell.
During treatment, your blood pressure may be lower or higher than normal. Tell your nurse if you feel dizzy, faint, or if you have headaches, nosebleeds, blurred or double vision, or shortness of breath. Your blood pressure usually goes back to normal while you are on treatment or when treatment ends.

Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
DPD defiency
Between 2 and 8 out of 100 people (2 to 8%) have 
low levels of an enzyme called DPD
 in their bodies. A lack of DPD can mean you’re more likely to have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil. It might take you a bit longer to recover from the chemotherapy. These side effects can rarely be life threatening.
Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.
Some people have severe side effects from capecitabine or fluorouracil even if they don't have low DPD levels. Contact your doctor or nurse if your side effects are severe.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Increased risk of getting an infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nosebleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Tiredness, weakness (fatigue) during and after treatment
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Diarrhoea
Contact your advice line if you have 
diarrhoea
, such as if you've had 4 or more loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours. Or if you can't drink to replace the lost fluid. Or if it carries on for more than 3 days.
Your doctor may give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty to replace the fluid lost.
Sore or dry mouth and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Soreness, redness and peeling on palms and soles of feets
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Changes in levels of minerals in your blood
You may have changes in levels of minerals and salts in your blood, including low levels of sodium or high levels of uric acid (causing gout). You have regular blood tests during treatment to check this.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Changes to your hearing
You might have some hearing loss, especially with high pitched sounds. You might also have some ringing in your ears (tinnitus). Tell your doctor or nurse if you notice any changes."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/chlvpp,ChlVPP,What else do I need to know?,"Other medicines, foods and drinks
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Procarbazine food and alcohol
Procarbazine interacts with alcohol and some foods, causing sickness, headaches, difficulty breathing, sweating, faintness or drowsiness. You should not drink alcohol while you are taking procarbazine.
Reactions to food are rare, so if you want to try a food on this list, you could have a little at a time until you are sure it won't upset you:
mature cheeses (including processed cheeses)
yeast or meat extracts such as Marmite, Oxo, and Bovril
salami and pepperoni
overripe fruit, broad beans
foods which have been fermented, pickled, smoked, hung or matured
Lactose intolerance
Chlorambucil contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Diabetes
Prednisolone can cause changes to blood sugar levels. So there is a risk of developing diabetes or making your diabetes worse while on this medication.
You might have regular blood and urine tests to check this. You might need to have blood sugar lowering treatment. But your sugar levels usually go back to normal shortly after you stop taking steroids.
If you have diabetes already, you might need to check your blood sugar levels more often than usual.
Chicken pox or shingles
Keep away from people who have chicken pox or shingles while you’re taking prednisolone, if you have never had these illnesses. They could make you very ill.
Tell your doctor or nurse straight away if you have been with someone who has chicken pox or shingles.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ceritinib,Ceritinib (Zykadia),How it works,"Ceritinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking an enzyme called anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Ceritinib only works in cancer cells that have an overactive version of ALK. About 5 in 100 people (5%) with NSCLC have this. It is called ALK positive disease.
Your doctor might recommend you have ceritinib if you have advanced non small cell lung cancer that is ALK positive and you have already had treatment with a drug called crizotinib.
You might also have certinib if you have not had any other treatments before."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/ceritinib,Ceritinib (Zykadia),How you have it,"Ceritinib is a capsule or tablet. You swallow your capsules or tablets whole with a glass of water.
You take it once a day, at the same time every day. Ceritinib should be taken with food (light to full meal). If ceritinib is taken on an empty stomach, then have it at least 2 hours before eating or 1 hour after eating.

Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."

Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Less commonly you might bleed from other areas of the body. Tell your medical team if you notice any bleeding.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can check for the cause of the pain and give you medicine to help.
Loss of appetite
You might 
lose your appetite
 for various reasons when you are having cancer treatment. Sickness, taste changes or tiredness can put you off food and drinks.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after taking these drugs.

Changes in the levels of minerals, proteins and enzymes in your body
Your blood contains different levels of minerals, proteins and enzymes. This treatment can change the levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, creatinine, and urea in your blood.
You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in these levels.
Liver changes
You might have liver changes that can cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. This is called jaundice. It is caused by high levels of bile pigments in the blood. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you have this.
You might also have changes in the levels of liver enzymes.
You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Changes in skin colour
Areas of skin may get darker or lighter. This usually gets better after treatment finishes but occasionally it can be permanent. Let your doctor or know if this happens.
Sore mouth, throat and lips

Tell your doctor or nurse if your mouth and throat is sore.
Changes to your taste
Taste changes
 may make you go off certain foods and drinks. You may also find that some foods taste different from usual or that you prefer to eat spicier foods. Your taste gradually goes back to normal a few weeks after your treatment finishes."

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment and for at least 6 months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

Difficulty breathing
You may have difficulty breathing with wheezing and coughing. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if this happens.
High levels of uric acid in your body
High levels of uric acid in your blood can lead to a build up of crystals in body tissues and cause inflamed joints. You’ll have regular blood tests to check your levels. Drinking plenty of fluids helps to flush out the excess uric acid. You might also have medicines to control the uric acid levels.
Changes to the way your heart works
You might have heart changes that show up on a heart trace (ECG). You have regular tests throughout your treatment to check for this. Your doctor may stop treatment for a short time or may lower the dose if you have this.

Low DPD levels don’t cause symptoms so you won’t know if you have a deficiency. You should have a test before you start this treatment to check if you have a DPD deficiency.

Keep away from people who have chicken pox or shingles whilst taking steroids if you have never had these illnesses. They could make you very ill.
If you do come into contact with someone who has them, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
Other medicines, food and drink
Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are having cyclophosphamide because it may increase the side effects.
Lactose intolerance
Prednisolone contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
Contraception and pregnancy
This treatment may harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least a year afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Loss of fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with these drugs. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
Don’t breastfeed during this treatment because the drugs may come through in your breast milk.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cav,CAV,When you have CAV,"You usually have CAV chemotherapy as cycles of treatment. This means that after each round of treatment you have a break to allow your body to recover.
Each cycle of treatment lasts 3 weeks. Depending on your needs, you might have between 4 and 6 cycles.
On the first day of the cycle you have:
doxorubicin and vincristine as slow injections into your bloodstream 
cyclophosphamide as a drip or slow injection
It takes about an hour to have all 3 drugs.
You don't have any treatment for the rest of the 3 weeks. Then you start the cycle again."

When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your advice line or your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, such as a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C, or if you develop a severe skin reaction. Signs of a severe skin reaction include peeling or blistering of the skin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/cav,CAV,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising and bleeding
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
High temperature or chills
You might get a high temperature. Or you might feel cold or start shivering (chills).
Contact your advice line straight away if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C.
Hair loss (complete hair loss)
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Mouth sores and ulcers
Mouth sores and ulcers 
can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes (peripheral neuropathy)
Numbness or tingling in fingers or toes
 is often temporary and can improve after you finish treatment. Tell your doctor if you're finding it difficult to walk or complete fiddly tasks such as doing up buttons.
Soreness, redness, peeling on palms or soles of the feet (hand foot syndrome)
The 
skin on your hands and feet may become sore, red, or may peel
. You may also have tingling, numbness, pain and dryness. This is called hand-foot syndrome or palmar plantar syndrome.
Moisturise your skin regularly. Your doctor or nurse will tell you what moisturiser to use.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Abnormal heart trace
You might have irregular results when you have a heart trace (ECG) done.
Blood in urine
You might have pain when you pass urine. Or you may see blood when you pass urine. This is caused by inflammation of the bladder. Let your doctor know if this happens.
You should drink 8 to 12 cups of fluid a day to try to prevent this.
Kidney damage
To help prevent 
kidney damage
, it is important to drink plenty of water. You might also have fluids into your vein before, during and after treatment. You have blood tests before your treatments to check how well your kidneys are working.
Tiredness (fatigue)
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting."

Nurse:
 This is a short film showing you how to give an injection just under your skin. This is called a subcutaneous or sub cut injection. This does not replace what your doctors and nurses tell you, so always follow their advice.
Voiceover: 
 Subcutaneous injections may be part of your cancer treatment.  Or, you may need them to prevent side effects of treatment, such as blood clots after surgery.  Or to help control cancer symptoms, such as pain or sickness.
Most injections come in prefilled syringes.
Nurse:
 So, today I am going to show you how to give a subcutaneous injection. I am going to start by giving it into a practice cushion and then you can have a go at giving one yourself. Before you start, you need to get your equipment together. What you are going to need is an alcohol wipe to clean your skin, some cotton wool, a prefilled syringe and a sharps bin. It is important that you wash your hands with soap and water and dry them thoroughly before you start. Check that you have got the correct drug and that it is in date.
You can give the injection into the back of your arm, your tummy, your thigh or the outer part of your bottom. It is important that you vary where you give the injection. So it may be that you give it one day in your tummy and the next in your thigh.
So you start by cleaning the skin with the alcohol wipe and allowing it to air dry. Then you take the cover off the needle and pinch the skin up and hold it a bit like a pen and in an upright position, in a quick dart like motion pop it straight down into the skin. Then you press the plunger right to the end, quickly pull the needle out, dab it with cotton wool, pop the needle into the sharps bin. And then you need to wash your hands again.
So here’s what you are going to need. If you start by checking the drug and the expiry date. And then with the alcohol wipe give your skin a clean. That’s it give it a few seconds for the air to dry it. Ok and then if you want to pick up the syringe and take the cover off the needle. Then pinch your skin up and at a ninety degree angle gently push the needle in...then press the plunger...and then quickly remove it... dab your skin with the cotton wool and put the syringe in the sharps bin."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/buserelin,Buserelin (Suprefact),When you have it,"You have it as an injection 3 times a day for 7 days. On the 8th day you start using buserelin as a nasal spray.
You spray the drug into each nostril 6 times a day. One way of remembering to do this is to use the spray before and after each meal. So you can have the treatment before and after breakfast, lunch and your evening meal.
You continue taking the buserelin for as long as it is working."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/buserelin,Buserelin (Suprefact),Tests during treatment,You have blood tests before starting treatment and during your treatment. They check your levels of testosterone every 3 months. They also check the levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. Other tests see how well your liver and kidneys are working.

Cancer drugs can interact with some other medicines and herbal products. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about any medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, herbal supplements and over the counter remedies.
Pregnancy and contraception
This treatment might harm a baby developing in the womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you're having treatment and for a few months afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Fertility
You may not be able to become pregnant or father a child after treatment with this drug. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Men might be able to store sperm before starting treatment. And women might be able to store eggs or ovarian tissue. But these services are not available in every hospital, so you would need to ask your doctor about this.
Breastfeeding
It is not known whether this drug comes through into the breast milk. Doctors usually advise that you don’t breastfeed during this treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisations
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy.
Sodium
This drug contains sodium (salt). You might need to take account of this if you are on a controlled sodium diet. Tell your doctor if you are on a low salt diet."

You take procarbazine and prednisolone as capsules or tablets.
Into your bloodstream
You might have treatment through a long plastic tube that goes into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment. This can be a:
central line
PICC line
portacath
If you don't have a central line
You might have treatment through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Find out more about central lines
Taking your tablets or capsules
You must take tablets and capsules according to the instructions your doctor or pharmacist gives you.
Whether you have a full or empty stomach can affect how much of a drug gets into your bloodstream.
You should take the right dose, not more or less.
Talk to your specialist or advice line before you stop taking a cancer drug."

https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/beacopp,BEACOPP,Tests,You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver and kidneys are working.
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/beacopp,BEACOPP,Side effects,"We haven't listed all the side effects. It's very unlikely that you will have all of these side effects, but you might have some of them at the same time.
How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatments you're having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you're also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
When to contact your team
Your doctor, nurse or pharmacist will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/beacopp,BEACOPP,Common side effects,"These side effects happen in more than 10 in 100 people (10%). You might have one or more of them. They include:
Increased risk of infection
Increased risk of getting an infection
 is due to a drop in white blood cells. Symptoms include a change in temperature, aching muscles, headaches, feeling cold and shivery and generally unwell. You might have other symptoms depending on where the infection is.
Infections can sometimes be life threatening. You should contact your advice line urgently if you think you have an infection.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Bruising, bleeding gums or nose bleeds
This is due to a 
drop in the number of platelets in your blood
. These blood cells help the blood to clot when we cut ourselves. You may have nosebleeds or bleeding gums after brushing your teeth. Or you may have lots of tiny red spots or bruises on your arms or legs (known as petechiae).
Lung problems
You might develop a 
cough or breathing problems
. This could be due to scarring (fibrosis) or infection, such as pneumonia or inflammation of the lungs. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you suddenly become short of breath or develop a cough. This can be life-threatening.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
High temperature and chills
You might get a high temperature. Or you might feel cold or start shivering (chills).
Contact your advice line straight away if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C.

can be painful. Keep your mouth and teeth clean; drink plenty of fluids; avoid acidic foods such as oranges, lemons and grapefruits; chew gum to keep the mouth moist and tell your doctor or nurse if you have ulcers.
Hair loss
You could 
lose all your hair
. This includes your eyelashes, eyebrows, underarm, leg and sometimes pubic hair. Your hair will usually grow back once treatment has finished but it is likely to be softer. It may grow back a different colour or be curlier than before.
Tiredness and weakness
You might feel 
very tired 
and as though you lack energy.
Various things can help you to reduce tiredness and cope with it, for example exercise. Some research has shown that taking gentle exercise can give you more energy. It is important to balance exercise with resting.
Feeling generally unwell
Speak to your doctor or nurse if you feel generally unwell after having this treatment.
Diarrhoea or constipation
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea or constipation
. They can give you medicine to help.
Heart problems
You may have changes to how your heart works. This can cause changes to your heart rhythm. Less commonly you might have a heart attack.
Your doctor might ask you to have tests to check your heart, such as an electrocardiogram 
(ECG)
 
.
Liver changes
You might have 
liver changes
 that are usually mild and unlikely to cause symptoms. They usually go back to normal when treatment finishes. You have regular blood tests to check for any changes in the way your liver is working.
Inflammation of the bladder
Inflammation of the bladder (cystitis) can cause pain and occasionally blood when passing urine.
Contact your advice line straight away if you see blood in your urine.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have this. They can check for the cause of the pain and give you medicine to help.
Changes to your finger tips

This drug contains lactose (milk sugar). If you have an intolerance to lactose, contact your doctor before taking this medicine.
You should not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice when you are taking this drug because it can react with the drug.
Loss of fertility
It is not known whether this treatment affects fertility in people. Talk to your doctor before starting treatment if you think you may want to have a baby in the future.
Contraception and pregnancy
This drug may harm a baby developing in your womb. It is important not to become pregnant or father a child while you are having treatment with this drug and for at least 1 week afterwards. Talk to your doctor or nurse about effective contraception before starting treatment.
Treatment for other conditions
Always tell other doctors, nurses, pharmacists or dentists that you’re having this treatment if you need treatment for anything else, including teeth problems.
Immunisation
Don’t have immunisations with live vaccines while you’re having treatment and for up to 12 months afterwards. The length of time depends on the treatment you are having. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how long you should avoid live vaccinations.
In the UK, live vaccines include rubella, mumps, measles, BCG, yellow fever and the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).
You can:
have other vaccines, but they might not give you as much protection as usual
have the flu vaccine (as an injection)
Contact with others who have had immunisations - 
You can be in contact with other people who have had live vaccines as injections. Avoid close contact with people who have recently had live vaccines taken by mouth (oral vaccines) such as the oral typhoid vaccine.
If your immune system is severely weakened, you should avoid contact with children who have had the flu vaccine as a nasal spray. This is for 2 weeks following their vaccination.
Babies have the live rotavirus vaccine. The virus is in the baby’s poo for about 2 weeks and could make you ill if your immunity is low. Get someone else to change their nappies during this time if you can. If this isn't possible, wash your hands well after changing their nappy."

merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) that has spread to other parts of the body 
a type of kidney cancer called renal cell cancer that has spread"
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/avelumab,Avelumab (Bavencio),How avelumab works,"Avelumab is a type of immunotherapy called a checkpoint inhibitor. This type of treatment stimulates the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells.
Avelumab targets and blocks a protein called PD-L1 on the surface of certain immune cells. Blocking PD-L1 activates the immune cells to find and kill cancer cells."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/avelumab,Avelumab (Bavencio),How you have avelumab,"You have avelumab as a drip into your bloodstream (intravenously). It takes about an hour each time you have it.
Into your bloodstream
You can have the drug through a thin short tube (a cannula) that goes into a vein in your arm each time you have treatment.
Or you might have it through a long line: a central line, a PICC line or a Portacath.
These are long plastic tubes that give the drug into a large vein in your chest. The tube stays in place throughout the course of treatment.
Find out more about long lines"

You might have paracetamol and an anti histamine drug before at least the first 4 avelumab treatments. This reduces your risk of having an allergic reaction during treatment."
https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/cancer-drugs/drugs/avelumab,Avelumab (Bavencio),Tests,"You have blood tests before and during your treatment. They check your levels of blood cells and other substances in the blood. They also check how well your liver, thyroid and kidneys are working."

How often and how severe the side effects are can vary from person to person. They also depend on what other treatment you are having. For example, your side effects could be worse if you are also having other drugs or radiotherapy.
This treatment affects the immune system. This may cause inflammation in different parts of the body which can cause serious side effects. They could happen during treatment, or some months after treatment has finished. In some people, these side effects could be life threatening.
When to contact your team
Your doctor or nurse will go through the possible side effects. They will monitor you closely during treatment and check how you are at your appointments. Contact your advice line as soon as possible if:
you have severe side effects 
your side effects aren’t getting any better
your side effects are getting worse
Early treatment can help manage side effects better.
Contact your doctor or nurse immediately if you have signs of infection, including a temperature above 37.5C or below 36C."

A reaction during the infusion
A reaction may happen during the infusion, causing a skin rash, itching, swelling of the lips, face or throat, breathing difficulties, fever and chills. Your nurse will give you medicines beforehand to try to prevent a reaction. Tell your nurse or doctor immediately if at any time you feel unwell. They will slow or stop your drip for a while and give you medicine to help relieve your symptoms.
Diarrhoea and inflamed bowel
Tell your doctor or nurse if you have 
diarrhoea
. Your doctor might give you anti diarrhoea medicine to take home with you after treatment. Eat less fibre, avoid raw fruits, fruit juice, cereals and vegetables, and drink plenty of liquid to replace the fluid lost.
Call your advice line if you have 4 loose watery poos (stools) in 24 hours, diarrhoea at night, or it carries on for more than 3 days. Or if you can’t drink enough to replace the lost fluid. Also, call if you have blood or mucus in your poo, your poo looks darker than usual, or if you develop pain in your tummy (abdomen).
Tiredness
Tiredness and weakness (fatigue)
 can happen during and after treatment - doing gentle exercises each day can keep your energy up. Don't push yourself, rest when you start to feel tired and ask others for help.
Let your doctor know if you are more tired than usual.
Loss of appetite and weight loss
You might not feel like eating
 and may lose weight. It is important to eat as much as you can. Eating several small meals and snacks throughout the day can be easier to manage. You can talk to a dietitian if you are concerned about your appetite or weight loss.
Difficulty breathing and cough
You may have difficulty breathing or a cough. Let your doctor or nurse know straight away if you have these symptoms. They can give you medicine to help.
Breathlessness and looking pale
You might be 
breathless and look pale
 due to a drop in red blood cells. This is called anaemia.
Feeling or being sick
Feeling or being sick 
is usually well controlled with anti sickness medicines. Avoiding fatty or fried foods, eating small meals and snacks, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation techniques can all help.
It is important to take anti sickness medicines as prescribed even if you don’t feel sick. It is easier to prevent sickness rather than treating it once it has started.
Tummy (abdominal) pain
Tell your treatment team if you have this. They can check the cause and give you medicine to help.
Pain in your back or joints
Let your doctor know if you have pain in your back or joints. There are lots of ways to treat pain, including painkillers and relaxation.
Constipation
Constipation
 is easier to sort out if you treat it early. Drink plenty of fluids and eat as much fresh fruit and vegetables as you can. Try to take gentle exercise, such as walking. Tell your doctor or nurse if you are constipated for more than 3 days. They can prescribe a laxative.
High temperature
If you get a high temperature, let your health care team know straight away. Ask them if you can take paracetamol to help lower your temperature.
Swollen hands and feet
Swelling of hands and feet is due to fluid build up. This is called oedema. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any swelling."
