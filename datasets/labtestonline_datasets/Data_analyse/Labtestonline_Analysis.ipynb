      "  \"Tumor markers are substances, often proteins, that are produced by the cancer tissue itself or sometimes by the body in response to cancer growth. Because some of these substances can be detected in body samples such as blood, urine, and tissue, these markers may be used, along with other tests and procedures, to help detect and diagnose some types of cancer, predict and monitor a person's response to certain treatments, and detect recurrence.\\nMore recently, the idea of what constitutes a tumor marker has broadened. Newer types of tests have been developed that look for changes in genetic material (DNA, RNA), rather than proteins, in patient samples. The genetic changes have been found to be associated with certain cancers and can be used as tumor markers to help determine prognosis, guide targeted treatment, and/or detect cancers early on. Moreover, advances in technology have led to tests that can evaluate several genetic markers or panels of markers at the same time, providing expanded information about characteristics of a tumor. Examples of these are included, along with more traditional tumor markers, in the table within this article.\\nWhile quite a few tumor markers are available and have been found to be clinically useful, others are available but not ordered frequently because they have been found to be less sensitive and/or specific. Still others are currently used only in research settings and continue to be evaluated in clinical trials. With ongoing research, and as the field continues to evolve, it is likely that more tumor markers with greater effectiveness will come on the market in the coming years, eventually replacing less useful ones.\\nLimitations\\nWhile tumor marker tests can provide very useful information, they do have limitations: Many tumor markers may also be elevated in persons with conditions or diseases other than cancer.\\nSome tumor markers are specific for a particular type of cancer, while others are seen in several different types of cancer.\\nNot every person with a particular type of cancer will have an elevated level of the corresponding tumor marker.\\nNot every cancer has a tumor marker that has been identified as associated with it. Consequently, tumor markers alone are not diagnostic for cancer; for some types of cancer, they provide additional information that can be considered in conjunction with a patient's medical history and physical exam as well as other laboratory and/or imaging tests.\"]\n",

In some laboratories, the direct LDL test will automatically be performed when the triglyceride levels are too high to calculate LDL-C. This saves the healthcare practitioner time by not needing to order another test, saves you time by not needing to have a second blood sample drawn, and speeds up the time to provide the test result.\\nWhether calculated or measured directly, LDL-C values are used to assess your risk for heart disease and help guide decisions about what treatment may be best if you are at borderline, intermediate, or high risk. The results are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow up. Treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or lipid-lowering medications such as statins.

These tests are most often recommended when a person has been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 or has been in a situation with an elevated risk of virus exposure such as a large social gathering.\\nScreening tests may be utilized in other circumstances such as:\\xa0 For residents and workers in shared living environments, especially if some individuals are vulnerable to severe illness with COVID-19. Examples of these potentially high-risk environments include nursing homes, correctional facilities, and homeless shelters.\\nFor all people admitted to the hospital, especially if there is significant community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\\nFor patients prior to surgeries or other medical procedures.\\nFor patients who are being prescribed drugs that could suppress their immune system.\\nFor employees or students who are often in close contact to detect asymptomatic cases as part of health programs to reduce virus transmission.\\xa0 Monitoring of patients can also employ tests for active infection. It is important to note, though, that a positive result on a repeat test does not always mean that a person is contagious, and likewise, a follow-up negative test result does not always mean that the individual is no longer contagious.\\nThere are not clear guidelines for who should receive testing for past infection. Many serologic tests are conducted as part of epidemiological studies about the number of people with prior infections. An antibody test may also be appropriate in patients who have health concerns that could be late-developing complications of COVID-19.\\nWith all of these test types, especially tests for active infections, available resources are an important factor in determining who should be tested. If testing capacity is limited, public health officials and health care providers may establish guidelines to prioritize the use of tests in specific patients or circumstances.\\nTalking with a doctor is the best way to determine if you should receive a coronavirus test, and, if so, which test is the best fit for your situation. It is especially important to talk with your doctor promptly if you have symptoms of COVID-19.\\nGetting test results\\nHow you get test results and how long it takes to receive them varies based on the type of test: Tests that require laboratory analysis usually have results available within a few business days, although some of these tests can be performed more quickly. Results are normally provided by your doctor’s office or sent electronically and/or by mail.\\nPoint-of-care tests are designed for rapid analysis without sending a sample to a laboratory. For these tests, results are often available in minutes or hours. Results may be delivered by a health care provider or sent directly to you either electronically or by mail.\\nMany at-home tests allow for your sample to be analyzed right after taking the test sample. You see the results yourself, and they are normally available in less than an hour.\\xa0 High demand for testing may affect the time required to receive some test results. Reduced test availability and strained laboratory capacity may create delays in analyzing test samples.']\n",

      "  'Testing is usually indicated if a person has symptoms of Lyme disease and a known or possible exposure to ticks that can carry the Borrelia bacteria. However, because it takes time for antibodies to develop, the timing of testing is important to consider.\\nLyme disease symptoms depend on the extent of the bacterial infection. Three phases are used to describe the infection:\\xa0 Early localized: In this initial phase, symptoms are normally found only near the tick bite. This early stage is called erythema migrans and involves a noticeable rash that typically develops within a few weeks after being bitten.\\nEarly disseminated: In this phase, the bacteria move through the blood to affect other parts of the body and can cause general symptoms like fever, headaches, and pain. In some cases, the bacteria can affect the heart or nervous system.\\nLate disease: This phase occurs long after the initial tick bite and most often includes symptoms affecting the joints or nervous system.\\xa0 It is important to understand these phases because testing is not equally valuable in each stage. With early localized disease and erythema migrans, blood testing is generally not helpful because antibodies have not had enough time to develop.\\nIn people with symptoms of early disseminated or late disease, testing can help determine whether they have had a previous Borrelia infection. Blood testing alone, though, does not diagnose Lyme disease. It is one factor to be considered alongside symptoms and potential tick exposure.\\nSome symptoms of Lyme disease, like joint pain, can be caused by many other health conditions. For this reason, testing is not recommended if you only have these kinds of nonspecific symptoms and no other indications of Borrelia exposure. In these cases, a positive test can be misleading because antibodies could be the result of a past infection rather than an active condition causing your present symptoms.\\nBecause of similar concerns about potential false positive results, random screening for Lyme disease in people without symptoms is not recommended even in areas that are known to have ticks that can carry the Borrelia bacteria.\\nTesting of the cerebrospinal fluid is most often indicated when a person has neurological symptoms consistent with Lyme disease and positive or inconclusive blood tests.\\nGetting test results\\nFor a blood test or lumbar puncture, you will likely receive test results from your doctor. Your doctor may call you with results or schedule you for a follow-up office visit. Results may also be sent to you through an online health portal or in the mail.\\nFor at-home blood tests that are sent to a lab, you usually get results a few business days after your sample is received. Results are often provided through a smartphone app or website.\\nLyme disease tests are generally effective for determining whether someone has been exposed to Borrelia, but, like any medical test, they are not perfect. There are considerations that can affect the accuracy of tests and how they are interpreted.\\xa0 Cross-reactivity: It is possible for antibodies to other bacteria to be detected by tests for antibodies to Borrelia. This is known as a false positive because the test shows Borrelia exposure when none actually occurred. A misleading positive result can also occur in patients who have previously had Lyme disease or who have received a vaccine for Lyme disease.\\nStandardization of interpretation: The CDC has issued guidelines for how to interpret antibody test results. Studies have found that laboratories that follow these guidelines produce more consistent and reliable analyses than laboratories that apply non-standard criteria.\\nTest timing: When the test is taken is important to consider because of the time it can take for different antibodies to develop and be detectable in the blood.\\xa0 The laboratory and doctor can take these factors into account when interpreting your test results. Overall, testing is typically reliable in assessing bacteria exposure, but it is important to remember that this is distinct from a definitive diagnosis of Lyme disease.']\n",

Doctors can assess an individual’s personal risk factors and determine the most appropriate testing strategy. Below is a brief overview of common STD screening recommendations: Adults and adolescents: Everyone from ages 13 to 64 should be tested for HIV at least once or more as needed based on risk level.\\nSexually active women: All sexually active women under 25 years old should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia at least every year. This recommendation also applies to women 25 years and older at an increased risk of STDs due to new or multiple sexual partners, or a partner who has been diagnosed with an STD.\\nPregnant women: During a pregnancy, women should be tested for syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B. Pregnant women with additional risk factors should also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea.\\nSexually active gay and bisexual men: Men in this group should be tested at least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Men with multiple or anonymous partners should be tested more frequently, such as every 3 or 6 months. This group may also benefit from more frequent HIV testing.\\nUnsafe sex and injectable drug users: Anyone who shares injection drug equipment or has sex without protection such as a condom should be tested for HIV at least once a year. Getting test results\\nPatients may receive results of STD tests during a follow-up appointment with their doctor, over the phone, or though online medical charts. It’s important to discuss STD test results with a healthcare professional who can help you manage your risk for STDs and answer your questions about test results.\\nIf STD test results are positive, it’s important to begin treatment as early as possible in order to reduce the chance of health complications.Your doctor can help you make a plan for sharing your results with sexual partners who may be infected and can discuss retesting that may be necessary after treatment is completed.']]\n"

      "  'Testing for antinuclear antibodies is a useful test for identifying patients who may have an autoimmune disorder. Like other blood tests though, ANA testing isn’t 100% accurate. When interpreting results of ANA testing, there are several important points about test accuracy to keep in mind: Positive results in healthy patients: Between 3 and 15% of healthy patients may test positive for ANAs. Testing positive is even more common in patients over 65 years of age, with approximately 10 to 37% of patients in this age group testing positive despite not having an autoimmune disorder. A positive ANA test result in a healthy patient is sometimes referred to as a false positive.\\nLack of standardization: The level of ANAs that is interpreted as a positive test result varies between laboratories. Some labs may interpret lower levels of ANAs as positive, making this test more sensitive for autoimmune disorders, but also increasing false positive results. Other laboratories may only interpret higher levels of ANAs as positive, increasing the risk of false negative results in which a person tests negative despite having an autoimmune disorder.\\nLimitations of solid phase assays: Compared to FANA testing, solid phase assays are capable of detecting fewer types of autoantibodies in a blood sample. This limitation means that patients with types of autoantibodies not detected in a solid phase assay may have false negative ANA test results. In order to reduce the risk of inaccurate or false positive results, doctors limit ANA testing to patients who have signs and symptoms of having an autoimmune disorder. If doctors order ANA testing for patients without symptoms, there is an increased risk of false positive test results.']\n",

In serology tests that look for these specific antibodies, vaccination may cause a positive result.

Once a local anesthetic has been sprayed onto the patient's upper airway, the practitioner can insert a tube into the bronchi and smaller bronchioles and aspirate fluid samples for testing. Sometimes, the healthcare practitioner will introduce a small amount of saline through the tubing and into the bronchi and then aspirate it to collect a bronchial washing.\\nSince young children cannot produce a sputum sample, gastric washings/aspirates may be collected. This involves introducing saline into the stomach through a tube, followed by fluid aspiration.\\nIf the healthcare practitioners suspect\\xa0TB is present outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary), they may test the body fluids and tissues most likely affected. For instance, one or more urine samples may be collected if the practitioner suspects TB has infected the kidneys. A needle may be used to collect fluid from joints or from other body cavities, such as the pericardium or abdomen.

A second set of blood cultures should be collected from a different site, immediately after the first venipuncture.

To preserve the organisms in the sample, the sample is put into a special container, referred to as \"viral transport media\" or VTM, for delivery to the laboratory.\\nThe nasopharyngeal swab is collected by having the person tip his or her head back, then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip®) is gently inserted into one of the nostrils until resistance is met (about 1 to 2 inches in), then rotated several times and withdrawn.

      "  'Light chains are proteins produced by immune cells called plasma cells. Also called kappa and lambda light chains, they link together with other proteins (heavy chains) to form immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) that target and neutralize specific threats to the body such as bacteria and viruses. Plasma cells normally produce some excess light chains that do not combine with heavy chains and instead enter the bloodstream. Free light chains (FLC) or serum free light chains (SFLC) refer to those that are not part of whole (intact) immunoglobulins and are present in the blood. This test measures the amount of free kappa and lambda light chains in the blood and calculates a kappa/lambda ratio to help detect, diagnose, and monitor conditions associated with an increased production of free light chains.\\nEach type of immunoglobulin is composed of four protein chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. A particular plasma cell will produce only one type of immunoglobulin. Normally, there is a slight excess of free light chains produced, so low levels of free kappa and lambda chains are detected in the blood.\\nWith a group of conditions called plasma cell disorders (dyscrasias) or monoclonal gammopathies, a plasma cell becomes neoplastic, dividing more than it should and producing a large number of copies (clones) of itself that crowd out other cells in the bone marrow. Since the clones come from a single plasma cell, they may produce large amounts of the same type of abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein). This may be an intact immunoglobulin, only a light chain, or rarely only a heavy chain.\\nExcess light chain production may be seen with any of the plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, a condition that may progress to multiple myeloma), monoclonal light chain (primary) amyloidosis, and others. These conditions may go unnoticed or may progress to produce various signs and symptoms characteristic of the different diseases.']\n",

This test measures the amount of cyclosporine in the blood.\\nWhen people undergo an organ transplant, their immune system recognizes the graft as \"foreign\" and will begin to attack it just as it would any invasive bacteria or virus. Cyclosporine diminishes the ability of certain white blood cells in the immune system to respond to this foreign tissue. The transplanted organ then has a better chance of survival and will not be as easily rejected by the transplant recipient\\'s immune system. Cyclosporine is used routinely in the transplantation of kidney, heart, liver, and other organs.\\nThe immunosuppressant qualities of cyclosporine have also been found to be useful in treating symptoms of some autoimmune and other disorders. These conditions are characterized by the immune system reacting to the body\\'s own cells or tissue. Cyclosporine helps to control the immune response in these cases, decreasing the severity of symptoms. Some examples of these conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, aplastic anemia, and Crohn disease.\\nWhen the symptoms in these cases are judged to be severe, extensive, and disabling, cyclosporine may be prescribed. Usually, the symptoms have not diminished with other treatments or medications. Cyclosporine is used with caution in these cases and needs to be carefully monitored with blood tests.\\nTesting cyclosporine levels in the blood can help ensure that drug levels are in a range that will be therapeutic. If the level is too low, organ rejection may occur (in the case of transplantation) or symptoms may reappear (autoimmune cases). It is also important to ensure that the level is not too high and will not result in toxicity.']\n",

HDL-C consists primarily of protein with a small amount of cholesterol. It is considered to be beneficial because it removes excess cholesterol from tissues and carries it to the liver for removal. HDL cholesterol is often called \"good\" cholesterol. The test for HDL cholesterol measures the amount of HDL-C in blood.\\nHigh levels of cholesterol have been shown to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease. When cholesterol levels in the blood increase and not enough is removed by HDL, it may be deposited in the walls of blood vessels. These deposits, called\\xa0plaques, can build up, causing vessel walls to become more rigid, and may eventually narrow the openings of blood vessels, constricting the flow of blood.\\nA higher level of blood HDL-C is usually associated with a lower risk of developing plaques, lowering the risk of heart attack or stroke.']\n",

      "  \"Heparin is a drug that inhibits blood clotting (anticoagulant) and is used to treat people who have developed dangerous blood clots (thrombi) or have a high risk of developing them. This test indirectly measures the amount of heparin in a person's blood by measuring its inhibition of factor Xa activity, one of the proteins involved in blood clot formation (known as heparin anti-Xa activity).\\nThe test is used to monitor heparin therapy to ensure that a person is receiving sufficient heparin for anticoagulation without causing excess bleeding. Since the test involves a chemical reaction color change (colorimetric), it is also known as chromogenic anti-Xa assay or anti-Xa assay, chromogenic.\\nBlood clotting is a normal response to blood vessel or tissue injury. It is a complex process that involves the activation and clumping of platelets at the site of injury and the initiation of the coagulation cascade, a sequential activation of coagulation factors, proteins that produce clots and regulate their development.\\nThere are a variety of conditions that can cause excessive clotting and lead to the formation of blood clots within veins and arteries. Some examples include surgeries, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and other excessive clotting disorders (hypercoagulable disorders). These clots can obstruct blood flow and cause tissue damage. Pieces of the blood clot can also break off and travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism. In pregnant women, blood clot formation can sometimes occur in the placenta and affect blood flow to the developing baby (fetus) and result in a miscarriage.\\nHeparin may be used to prevent or treat these excessive clotting conditions (anticoagulation therapy). Through its binding to the protein antithrombin, heparin interferes with the clotting process by inhibiting clotting factors, particularly factors Xa and IIa (thrombin).\\nHeparin molecules vary in size and activity and there are three types of heparin that may be used for treatment: Standard heparin, commonly known as unfractionated heparin (UFH), is usually given through injections into a vein (intravenously, IV). UFH affects both factors Xa and IIa and has varying effects among patients, so it must be closely monitored. Complications may include clotting (insufficient heparin), excessive bleeding (too much heparin), and sometimes decrease in platelets and thrombosis (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis).\\nLow molecular weight heparin (LMWH) consists of a narrower range of smaller heparin molecules and is typically given through injections under the skin (subcutaneous). LMWH primarily affects Xa and its effect is more predictable; therefore, routine laboratory monitoring is not required.\\nFondaparinux consists of only a small fraction of UFH (a sequence of five monomeric sugar units of heparin) and only inhibits factor Xa. It does not inhibit thrombin. Like LMWH, fondaparinux is given subcutaneously and routine laboratory monitoring is not required. Unfractionated heparin is often used for initial treatment when excessive clotting conditions are acute. It is eventually replaced by the use of oral anticoagulants or LMWH for longer-term treatment to lower the risk of blood clots. UFH is usually given in a hospital setting and monitored with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test, but it may need to be monitored with the heparin anti-Xa test.\\nHigh doses of UFH given during surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass are typically monitored using the activated clotting time (ACT) test.\\nLMWH and fondaparinux may be given in either an outpatient or hospital setting. Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux significantly prolong PTT at therapeutic dosage. If monitoring is required, the anti-Xa test is used.\"]\n",

Calcium levels are tightly controlled; if there is too little absorbed or ingested, or if there is excess loss through the kidney or gut, calcium is taken from bone to maintain blood concentrations.

The ionized calcium test measures only the free, metabolically active form.\\nSome calcium is lost from the body every day, filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted into the urine and sweat.
