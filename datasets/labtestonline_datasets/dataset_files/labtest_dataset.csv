17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) is a steroid hormone that is produced as part of the process of making the hormone cortisol. This test measures the amount of 17-OHP in the blood to detect and/or evaluate congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an inherited condition that results in decreased adrenal cortisol and aldosterone and increased male sex hormone (androgen) production.
17-OHP is derived from cholesterol. It is not an active steroid hormone, but is a precursor that can be converted to active hormones.
The adrenal glands produce the hormone coritsol, which helps break down protein, glucose, and lipids, maintains blood pressure, and regulates the immune system. The adrenal glands also produce other steroid hormones such as aldosterone, which helps regulate salt levels and blood pressure, and androgens, substances that, like testosterone, cause male sexual features as well as other effects.
Several enzymes are required to complete the steps involved in the production of cortisol. If one or more of these enzymes is deficient or dysfunctional, then inadequate amounts of cortisol are produced, as occurs with CAH. The most common cause of CAH is a partial or complete lack of the enzyme 21-hydroxylase, accounting for about 90% of cases.
Because a low level of cortisol causes an elevation in the level of a particular pituitary hormone that stimulates adrenal growth and hormone production (adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH), the adrenal gland increases in size (adrenal hyperplasia). However, the increased size and activity cannot overcome the block in cortisol production. Other substances such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone and androgens that do not need the defective enzyme are produced in excess. This is why testing for 17-OHP can help to detect CAH.
CAH is a group of inherited disorders caused by specific gene mutations and associated with cortisol-related enzyme deficiencies. About 90% of CAH cases are caused by a mutation in the 21-hydroxylase gene (also called CYP-21 or P450c1 or CYP21A2) and may be detected due to the accumulation of 17-OHP in the blood. The disease is caused when both genes, one from each parent, have mutations that decrease or stop the activity of the enzyme for which the gene codes. Parents may be carriers, and carriers may not have any signs of the disease.
CAH with 21-hydroxylase deficiency is inherited as either a severe or mild type:

Severe forms can cause babies to be born with serious deficiencies of both aldosterone and cortisol that will require medical attention. This severe form is most often detected in infancy during routine newborn screening or during early childhood. If not detected by screening, it may present in early childhood with signs and symptoms such as vomiting, listlessness, lack of energy (lethargy), not eating well, failure to thrive, dehydration and low blood pressure, particularly with acute illness.

	Due to the excess androgens, the development of male sexual characteristics in females (virilization) can occur. Female babies may have sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia), making it difficult to initially determine their sex. Females may have excess hair growth on face and body (hirsutism) and other male secondary sexual characteristics during childhood and adolescence as well as irregular menstruation. Males with this condition will appear normal at birth but may start to develop sexual characteristics prematurely and are at risk for fertility issues later in life.

In the milder, yet more common form of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, there may be only partial deficiency of the enzyme. This type, sometimes called late-onset or non-classical CAH, can have symptoms that begin to appear any time during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The symptoms can be vague, may develop slowly over time, and may vary from person to person. Though this form of CAH is not life-threatening, it may cause problems with growth, development, and puberty in children and may lead to infertility in adults.

As part of a routine newborn screen when an infant's sex is not obvious (ambiguous genitalia); when a female has increased growth of facial and body hair (hirsutism) or other symptoms that could be related to elevated male sex hormones; when a male child has premature sexual development; periodically to monitor CAH treatment


","



The 17-OHP test is ordered routinely as part of a newborn screen and may be repeated if the screening test is elevated in order to confirm the initial results.
A 17-OHP test may be ordered when an infant or young child has signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or of CAH. Some signs and symptoms may include:

Listlessness, lack of energy (lethargy)
Not eating well
Skin color that looks more tanned than would be otherwise expected
Dehydration
Low blood pressure
Sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)
Development of male secondary sex characteristics (virilization)
Acne
	 

This test may sometimes be ordered in older children or in adults when the milder form of CAH (late-onset) is suspected. The 17-OHP test may also be conducted when a girl or woman is experiencing symptoms that may be due to CAH or may be due to another condition, such as PCOS. Symptoms may include:

Excess facial and body hair (hirsutism)
Lack of or irregular menstrual periods (menses)
Development of male secondary sex characteristics
Infertility
	 

Testing may be performed on boys or men when they experience:

Early (precocious) puberty
Infertility
	 

When a person has been diagnosed with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, then a 17-OHP test may be ordered periodically to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.



","



If a newborn or infant has significantly elevated concentrations of 17-OHP, then it is likely that he or she has CAH. If a person has moderately increased levels, then that person may have a less severe case of CAH or may have an 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (another enzyme defect that is associated with CAH).
Normal 17-OHP results mean that it is likely that the person tested does not have CAH due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Low or decreasing concentrations in a person with CAH indicate a response to treatment. High or increasing levels may indicate that changes in treatment are required.



","



Sometimes an ACTH stimulation is required to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the 17-OHP test. This test involves measuring the level of cortisol in a person's blood before and after an injection of synthetic ACTH. In CAH, ACTH stimulation will markedly increase 17-OHP levels.
Premature infants often have elevated levels of 17-OHP. The newborn screen may need to be repeated at a later time.
Rarely, prenatal 17-OHP testing may be performed on amniotic fluid to detect and treat CAH in the fetus during pregnancy. Treatment of the fetus before birth is controversial.



",,"



The 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) test is used to screen for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and may be used along with other tests to help diagnose and monitor CAH.
Screening

The 17-OHP test is routinely ordered as part of newborn screening in the United States to detect CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
The 17-OHP test may be used to screen for CAH in older children or adults before symptoms appear or to confirm a CAH diagnosis in people with symptoms.

Diagnosis

Measurement of 17-OHP in the blood may be used to aid in the diagnosis of CAH in older children and adults who may have a milder, ""late-onset"" form.

Monitoring

If someone is diagnosed with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, a 17-OHP test along with plasma renin activity, androstenedione and testosterone tests may be used periodically to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

Ruling out CAH

A 17-OHP test may also sometimes be used, along with other hormone tests, to help rule out CAH in women who have symptoms such as excess facial and body hair and irregular periods. This includes women with suspected polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and infertility, and rarely those with suspected adrenal or ovarian cancers.

17-OHP testing, especially the newborn screening test, may produce false-positive results. If the level is elevated but not so high that it is diagnostic of CAH, other tests may be performed, such as:

Plasma renin activity
Androstenedione
Testosterone

Other tests

An ACTH stimulation test may be also be ordered as a follow-up test. In CAH, ACTH stimulation will markedly increase 17-OHP levels.
Genetic testing may be performed to detect CYP21A2 gene mutations that can cause the condition.
A karyotype test may be ordered as a follow-up test to detect chromosome disorders and to help determine a baby's sex.
Electrolytes may be ordered to measure the person's sodium and potassium levels.

5-hiaa,"['HIAA', 'Serotonin Metabolite']","

You may be instructed to avoid certain foods and medications prior to this test. (For more details, see the ""What is being tested?"" section below.)


","

To help diagnose and monitor treatment for a carcinoid tumor that produces serotonin


","

A 24-hour urine sample; rarely, a random urine sample or a blood sample drawn from a vein


","



5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is the primary breakdown product (metabolite) of serotonin, a chemical substance (neurotransmitter) that transmits messages between nerve cells. This test measures the amount of 5-HIAA in the urine or blood.
Serotonin is produced as needed by the nervous system, mainly the brain, but also special cells in the bronchial tubes (lungs) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It helps transmit nerve impulses and constrict blood vessels, participates in the wake-sleep cycle, and affects mood. After it is used by the body, serotonin is broken down in the liver, and its metabolites, including 5-HIAA, are eliminated in the urine.
Ordinarily, only small varying amounts of 5-HIAA are present in the urine. Large quantities of serotonin and 5-HIAA may be produced, however, by some carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing noncancerous or cancerous neuroendocrine masses that can form in the GI tract, especially in the appendix, and in the lungs. About 2 out of every 3 carcinoid tumors are found in the GI tract with most of the rest occurring in the lungs, although they may affect other organs as well.
According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 neuroendocrine tumors or cancers that start in the GI tract and 2,000 to 4,000 that start in the lungs diagnosed each year in the United States. Many more of these tumors may exist, but most remain small and do not cause any symptoms. When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs.
About 10% of carcinoid tumors, primarily those found in the GI tract affecting the liver, will produce enough serotonin to cause symptoms, such as flushing of the face, diarrhea, a rapid heart rate, and wheezing, which are referred to as carcinoid syndrome. The serotonin that causes carcinoid syndrome may be released continuously or intermittently and can lead to significantly increased quantities of 5-HIAA in the blood and urine.
How is the sample collected for testing?

A 24-hour urine sample is preferred for the 5-HIAA test because the level of the metabolite can vary during the day. For a 24-hour urine collection, all of the urine produced should be saved for a 24-hour period. It is best to keep the sample in a cool, dark place, such as a refrigerator.
A random urine sample is sometimes tested, usually along with a urine creatinine level, when a 24-hour sample is not feasible. The random sample is not as accurate, however, and if excess 5-HIAA is released intermittently, then it may be missed.
Sometimes a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm.

Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Test preparation is important for accurate 5-HIAA test results. Foods rich in serotonin such as avocados, bananas, pineapples, plums, cantaloupes, grapefruits, plantains, melons, kiwi fruits, walnuts, hickory nuts, butternuts, pecans, tomatoes, and eggplants can interfere with 5-HIAA measurement and should be avoided for 3 days prior to and during sample collection. There are also a variety of drugs that can affect metabolism of serotonin and thus the 5-HIAA test. It is important that you talk to your healthcare provider before decreasing or discontinuing any medications.
Some laboratories request for overnight fasting prior to collection of blood samples.

Flushing of the face and neck (appearance of deep red color, usually with sudden onset)
Diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
Rapid heart rate
Wheezing, coughing, difficulty breathing


This test may also be ordered at intervals when monitoring the effectiveness of treatment for a carcinoid tumor.



","



A significantly increased level of 5-HIAA when you have carcinoid syndrome symptoms is suggestive but not diagnostic of a carcinoid tumor. In order to diagnose the condition, the tumor itself must be located, biopsied, and examined by a pathologist. Your healthcare practitioner will frequently follow an abnormal test result with an order for an imaging scan to help locate any tumor(s) that may be present.
You may still have a carcinoid tumor even if your 5-HIAA level is normal. Some carcinoid tumors do not produce serotonin or only produce it intermittently.
If you have no symptoms and normal levels of 5-HIAA, it is unlikely you have a carcinoid tumor that produces serotonin.
If you are being monitored following treatment for carcinoid tumor, decreasing levels of 5-HIAA indicate a response to treatment, while increased or rising levels indicate that treatment has not been successful.



","



There are a variety of drugs that can affect the 5-HIAA test: 

Medications that can increase 5-HIAA include acetaminophen, caffeine, ephedrine, diazepam (Valium®), fluorouracil, glyceryl guaiacolate (an ingredient found in some cough medicines), melphalan (Alkeran®), mephenesin, methamphetamine (Desoxyn), methocarbamol (Robaxin®), naproxen, nicotine, phenacetin, phenmetrazine, phenobarbital, phentolamine, rauwolfia, and reserpine.
Medications that can decrease 5-HIAA include aspirin, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), corticotropin, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, ethyl alcohol, gentisic acid, homogentisic acid, hydrazine derivatives, imipramine(Tofranil®), isocarboxazid (Marplan), levodopa, MAO inhibitors, heparin, isoniazid, methenamine, methyldopa(Aldomet®), perchlorperazine, phenothiazines (Compazine®), promazine, promethazine (Mepergan®) and tricyclic antidepressants.

acetaminophen,['Paracetamol'],"

None


","

To determine if an overdose has occurred and if an antidote is required; to determine risk of liver damage and to help monitor the outcome of antidote treatment


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Acetaminophen is one of the most common pain relievers (analgesics) and fever reducers (antipyretics) available over the counter. It is generally regarded as safe. However, it is also the most common cause of toxic hepatitis in North America and Europe and one of the most common poisonings from either accidental or intentional overdose.
Once entering your body, like many other medications, acetaminophen is processed in the liver into harmless substances and removed in your urine. However, about 5 to 10% of the absorbed acetaminophen is converted to a toxic, highly-reactive byproduct. Fortunately, your liver makes a antioxidant called glutathione that binds to the byproduct and minimizes its toxic effects. When a large dose of acetaminophen is ingested or that exceeds the recommended amount over a period of time, the liver is no longer able to produce enough protective glutathione; as a result, the toxic byproduct builds up in the liver and may cause severe liver damage if timely treatment is not given.
For this reason, acetaminophen can be harmful or even fatal if not taken correctly and children in particular are at risk if caregivers do not follow dosing instructions carefully. Often, people do not realize that acetaminophen is one of the ingredients in many combination medications such as cold and flu preparations. If two or more of these medications are taken together, levels of acetaminophen may exceed safe limits.
Acetaminophen preparations come in varying strengths and several different forms, including tablets, capsules and liquid.

For adults, the typical maximum daily limit for acetaminophen is 4000 milligrams (mg). Consuming more than 4000 mg in a 24-hour period is considered an overdose, while ingesting more than 7000 mg can lead to a severe overdose reaction unless treated promptly.
For children, the amount that is considered an overdose depends on their age and body weight. (For more on this, see the MayoClinic webpage Acetaminophen and children: Why dose matters.)

If it is known or suspected that someone has ingested an overdose of acetaminophen, it is recommended to take the person to the emergency room. If a health practitioner determines that an overdose has occurred, treatment may include an antidote, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which can help minimize damage to the liver, especially if given within 8 to 12 hours after an overdose. Though NAC is ideally administered within this timeframe, people who seek treatment more than 12 hours after ingestion may still be given the antidote.
Until recently, NAC for people who visit healthcare providers later than 24 hours after acetaminophen ingestion was not the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose management in the United States. However, study data from England suggest that NAC may be beneficial for acetaminophen-induced liver failure more than 24 hours after ingestion.

When it is suspected that a person has ingested an overdose of acetaminophen or has signs and symptoms of toxicity, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain; when following a patient, every 4 to 6 hours after an overdose of the drug is ingested


","



Healthcare practitioners may order acetaminophen levels beginning at 4 hours after ingestion or possible ingestion and then every 4 to 6 hours to monitor whether the drug level is increasing or decreasing. Samples collected too soon after ingestion may not accurately reflect the amount absorbed from the stomach into the blood.
Testing may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms of an overdose. These can appear as early as 2 to 3 hours after ingestion or may not occur for 12 or more hours. Some of these include:

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
Loss of appetite
Abdominal pain or cramping
Irritability
Sweating
	 

If untreated, toxicity can progress within 3 to 4 days to include jaundice, liver and kidney failure, convulsions, coma and death. If treatment is received within 8 hours of the overdose, however, there is a very good chance of recovery.
For children who have taken acetaminophen in liquid form, a treatment decision may be made as soon as 2 hours after ingestion since the drug is absorbed more rapidly in this form.

The table below summarizes some results that may be seen:



Acetaminophen Level
Result Interpretation


10-20 mcg/mL
Therapeutic levels


Less than 150 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion
Low risk of liver damage


Greater than 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion
			Or
Greater than 50 mcg/mL 12 hours after ingestion

Associated with toxicity and liver damage



The levels discussed above typically apply to a single ingestion of a toxic amount of the drug. They do not necessarily apply to cases in which the recommended amount of acetaminophen has been exceeded over a period of time (chronic overdose ingestion). However, a healthcare practitioner may take acetaminophen levels into account along with clinical signs and symptoms and liver tests to determine the risk and/or presence of liver damage in chronic overdose cases.



","



Acetaminophen is the most common drug ingredient for medicines used in the U.S., including over-the-counter medicines for cold and the flu, allergies and sleeplessness. Consumers can buy many products containing acetaminophen without a prescription. Accidental overdose may happen when multiple medications containing acetaminophen are used simultaneously, resulting in a total combination dose that exceeds the maximum safe limits, especially for those with liver diseases and excessive alcoholic consumption.
If you drink three or more alcoholic beverages each day, ask your healthcare provider if you should take acetaminophen. If you will be taking more than the occasional 1 or 2 doses of acetaminophen, do not drink alcohol as this may increase the chance of liver damage.
It is important for you to tell your physicians, dentists and other healthcare providers about all the medications you are taking so that accidental overdose due to combination use can be avoided.



","



The test for acetaminophen is used to measure the level of drug in the blood in order to establish a diagnosis of overdose, to assess the risk of liver damage, and to help decide on the need for treatment. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important for a positive outcome.

","



Acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target proteins called acetylcholine receptors that are located on muscles that you can consciously or voluntarily control (known as skeletal muscle fibers). This test detects and measures AChR antibodies in the blood.
Muscle movement starts when an impulse is sent down a nerve to the nerve ending, where it stimulates the release of acetylcholine, a chemical substance (neurotransmitter) that transmits messages between specific types of cells. Acetylcholine travels across the very small gap between the nerve ending and a muscle fiber (this gap is called the ""neuromuscular junction""). When acetylcholine reaches the muscle fiber, it binds to one of many acetylcholine receptors or ""docking stations"" and activates it, initiating muscle contraction.
AChR antibodies impede communication between nerves and skeletal muscles, inhibit muscle contraction, and cause rapid muscle fatigue by preventing activation of the acetylcholine receptors. They do this in three major ways:

Binding antibodies attach to the receptors on nerve cells and may initiate an inflammatory reaction that destroys the receptors.
Blocking antibodies may sit on the receptors, preventing acetylcholine from binding.
Modulating antibodies may cross-link the receptors, causing them to be taken up into the muscle cell and removed from the neuromuscular junction.

The end result of this interference is the development of myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic autoimmune disorder associated with the presence of these antibodies and with their effects on muscle control.
AChR antibodies may be detected in different ways to determine which mechanism may be the problem, and the antibodies may be referred to as ""binding,"" ""blocking,"" or ""modulating."" However, the technique that measures ""binding"" is the most commonly performed and, generally speaking, it is rare for the other two tests to be positive without the ""binding"" test being positive as well. These other two tests may be useful when a healthcare practitioner strongly suspects myasthenia gravis and the ""binding"" test is negative.

The AChR antibody test may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms that suggest myasthenia gravis, such as:

Drooping eyelid
Double vision
Decreased eye movement control
Difficulty swallowing, chewing, with choking, drooling and gagging
Slurred speech
Weak neck muscles
Trouble holding up your head
Difficulty breathing
Difficulty walking and an altered gait
Specific muscle weakness but normal feelings/sensations
Muscle weakness that worsens with sustained effort and improves with rest

In patients with known myasthenia gravis, repeat AChR antibody tests may be done to monitor response to therapy, to guide disease management, or to assess the risk of AChR antibody transfer from a mother to her unborn child.
An AChR antibody test may sometimes be ordered when a thymoma is detected during an imaging scan.



","



AChR antibodies are not normally present in the blood. They are autoantibodies and their presence indicates an autoimmune response.
If you have AChR antibodies and symptoms of myasthenia gravis (MG), then it is likely that you have this condition. The extent to which AChR antibodies are elevated does not predict the severity of the disease at the time of diagnosis. However, changes in AChR antibody concentrations over time may help inform the effectiveness of treatment or predict the recurrence of disease. Therefore, repeat testing of AChR antibodies may be requested in some cases.
AChR antibodies may also be positive with some thymomas, in people who are being treated with drugs such as penicillamine, with some small cell lung cancers, with autoimmune liver disease, with Guillain-Barre syndrome, and with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (a condition associated with interference with the release of acetylcholine from the nerve ending).
A negative test result does not rule out MG. Up to 50% of those with ocular MG (affecting only eye-related muscles) and about 10-15% of those with generalized MG will be negative for AChR antibodies. Repeat testing of AChR antibodies in those with initially negative results may be useful as the concentration of antibodies may increase as the disease progresses, resulting in a subsequent positive AChR antibody test result.
Results from other tests for autoantibodies, such as anti-MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) antibody test, anti-LRP4 (LDL-receptor-related protein 4) antibody test, and anti-striated muscle antibody test, may also aid in establishing a diagnosis.



","



Use of drugs such as succinylcholine can increase AChR antibodies.
People who have MG are more likely to also have other autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.
Recent radioactive treatments can interfere with testing.



","



An acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody test is used to help diagnose myasthenia gravis (MG) and to distinguish it from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as chronic muscle fatigue and weakness.
Three types of AChR antibodies may be tested:

AChR binding antibodies
AChR blocking antibodies
AChR modulating antibodies

The test that measures binding antibodies is most commonly used because it is generally rare for the other two tests to be positive without the binding antibody test being positive as well. These other two tests may be used when a healthcare practitioner strongly suspects myasthenia gravis and the binding antibody test is negative.
One or more of these AChR antibody tests may be ordered as part of a panel of tests that may also include a striated muscle antibody test to help establish a diagnosis. If AChR antibody test results are normal but a healthcare practitioner strongly suspects myasthenia gravis, an anti-MuSK (muscle-specific tyrosine kinase) antibody test may also be ordered.
People with MG often have an enlarged thymus gland and may have thymomas (typically benign tumors of the thymus). Located under the breastbone, the thymus is an active part of the immune system during childhood but normally becomes less active during the teen years. If a thymoma is detected, such as during a chest computed tomography (CT) scan done for a different reason, then an AChR antibody test may sometimes be used to determine whether the person has developed these antibodies.

To help diagnose tuberculosis (TB) and infections caused by other Mycobacterium species, which are known as acid-fast bacilli (AFB), in people at risk of developing mycobacterial infections; to monitor the effectiveness of treatment


","

For suspected cases of tuberculosis lung infections, usually three sputum samples are collected early in the morning on different days. If you are unable to produce sputum, a bronchoscope may be used to collect fluid during a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In children, gastric washings/aspirates may be collected. Depending on symptoms, urine, an aspirate from the site of suspected infection, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), other body fluids, or biopsied tissue samples may be collected for AFB testing.


","



Most samples that are submitted for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) testing are collected because the healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has tuberculosis (TB), a lung infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacteria are called acid-fast bacilli because they are a group of rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) that can be seen under the microscope following a staining procedure where the bacteria retain the color of the stain after an acid wash (acid-fast). AFB laboratory tests detect the bacteria in a person's sample and help identify an infection caused by AFB.
There are several types of AFB that may be detected with this testing; however, the most common and medically important ones are members of the genus Mycobacterium. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most prevalent and infectious species of mycobacteria.
Since TB is transmitted through the air when an infected person sneezes, coughs, speaks, or sings, it is a public health risk. It can spread in confined populations, such as in the home and schools, correctional facilities, and nursing homes. Those who are very young, elderly, or have preexisting diseases and conditions, such as AIDS, that compromise their immune systems tend to be especially vulnerable. AFB testing can help diagnose, track, and minimize the spread of TB in these populations and help determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Another group of mycobacteria referred to as nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) can also cause infections. However, only a few of the more than 60 species of mycobacteria that have been identified cause infections in humans. Some examples include Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex (MAC), which can cause lung infection and disseminated disease in people with weakened immune systems. (See the article on Nontuberculous Mycobacteria for more details on different types). In addition to TB, AFB testing can help identify infections caused by these nontuberculous mycobacteria.
See ""How is it used?"" under Common Questions below for details on AFB tests.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Sputum is the most commonly tested sample. Sputum is phlegm, thick mucus that is coughed up from the lungs. Preferably, three early morning samples obtained by deep cough are collected on consecutive days in individual sterile cups to increase the likelihood of detecting the bacteria.
If a person is unable to produce sputum, a healthcare practitioner may collect respiratory samples using a procedure called a bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy allows the healthcare practitioner to look at and collect samples from the bronchi and bronchioles. Once a local anesthetic has been sprayed onto the patient's upper airway, the practitioner can insert a tube into the bronchi and smaller bronchioles and aspirate fluid samples for testing. Sometimes, the healthcare practitioner will introduce a small amount of saline through the tubing and into the bronchi and then aspirate it to collect a bronchial washing.
Since young children cannot produce a sputum sample, gastric washings/aspirates may be collected. This involves introducing saline into the stomach through a tube, followed by fluid aspiration.
If the healthcare practitioners suspect TB is present outside of the lungs (extrapulmonary), they may test the body fluids and tissues most likely affected. For instance, one or more urine samples may be collected if the practitioner suspects TB has infected the kidneys. A needle may be used to collect fluid from joints or from other body cavities, such as the pericardium or abdomen. Occasionally, the practitioner may collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or perform a minor surgical procedure to obtain a tissue biopsy.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed, except to rinse the mouth with water before collecting the sputum sample.

A TB screening test is positive and the person is at increased risk for active disease and/or characteristic signs are seen in an X-ray of the lung; there are two types of tests that are used to determine if a person has had contact or is infected with M. tuberculosis: the tuberculin test (TST) and the blood test (IGRA).
Someone has been in close contact with a person who has been diagnosed with TB and the exposed person either has symptoms or has a condition or disease, such as HIV, that puts the person at a much higher risk of contracting active TB.
An individual is being treated for TB; AFB testing is usually ordered at intervals, both for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment and for determining whether or not a person is still infectious.
An individual has a chronic skin infection that does not respond to the usual antibiotics given for a bacterial infection; NTM may be the cause of the infection since they do not respond to the same antibiotics used to treat a staphylococcal or streptococcal infection.

AFB Smear and NAAT
A negative AFB smear may mean that no infection is present, that symptoms are caused by something other than mycobacteria, or that the mycobacteria were not present in sufficient numbers to be seen under the microscope. Usually three samples are collected to increase the probability that the organisms will be detected.
Nevertheless, if AFB smears are negative and there is still a strong suspicion of a mycobacterial infection, then additional samples may be collected and tested on different days. A smear negative sample may still grow mycobacteria since the culture media  allows low numbers of bacteria that cannot be seen in a microscopic examination to multiply and be detected.
Positive AFB smears indicate a probable mycobacterial infection. However, a culture must be performed to confirm a diagnosis and identify the species of mycobacteria present.
For people with signs and symptoms of an active TB infection, AFB smear results are considered together with results from NAAT for TB, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though definitive diagnosis requires results from a culture, results from the smear and NAAT may be helpful in deciding what to do. For example, if there is a presumptive diagnosis of TB based on rapid test results, most health practitioners would treat.
Interpretation of smear and NAAT results are summarized in the following table. Again, all results must be confirmed by results from culture.



AFB smear result
NAAT result for TB
Interpretation


Positive
Positive
Presumptive diagnosis for TB


Negative
Positive
NAAT is more sensitive than an AFB smear so this may occur in people with true disease; may test additional samples using NAAT. If more than one sample is positive by NAAT, this is a presumptive diagnosis for TB.


Positive
Negative
Questionable results for TB; the AFB seen on the smear are not M. tuberculosis.


Negative
Negative
Symptoms probably not due to active mycobacterial infection.



AFB Culture
Positive AFB cultures identify the particular mycobacterium causing symptoms, and susceptibility testing on the identified organism gives the healthcare practitioner information about how resistant it may be to treatment.
A positive AFB smear or culture several weeks after drug treatment has started may mean that the treatment regimen is not effective and needs to be changed. It also means that the person is still likely to be infectious and can pass the mycobacteria to others through coughing or sneezing.
A negative culture means that the person tested does not have an active AFB infection or that mycobacteria were not present in that particular sample (which is why multiple samples are often collected) or were present in numbers too low to be detected. Cultures are held for six to eight weeks before being reported as negative. The person tested may have a latent infection that caused a TB screening test to be positive but does not have active TB.
If it is suspected that someone has a TB infection that has spread to another part of the body, a sample from the site of suspected infection may need to be collected and tested to identify the infection.
A negative culture several weeks after treatment indicates that the TB infection is responding to drug treatment and that the person is no longer infectious.
Susceptibility Testing
Susceptibility testing results will list the antibiotics that will likely be most effective in treating the infection. Isoniazid and rifampin are two drugs commonly used to treat TB. If the bacteria are resistant to more than one or the primary drugs used for therapy, the organisms are called multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and if the organisms are resistant to multiple drugs approved for first and second lines of therapy, they are called extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).



","



TB requires a lengthy course of multiple antibiotics to cure an active infection. People with inactive (latent) infections, although asymptomatic, may be treated with a single drug to reduce the risk of having an active infection in the future.
A faster lab method to culture Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been developed. Culturing the sample in a liquid broth-based medium allows the organisms to be detected sooner. Some of the broth cultures require an automated instrument to detect the presence of the mycobacteria, while other methods can be read manually. A liquid culture method, called Microscopic-Observation Drug-Susceptibility (MODS) assay, takes only about 7 days to diagnose TB and detects bacterial resistance to antibiotics at the same time. Since this method can recognize the presence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) much more quickly than conventional culture, it can help health practitioners diagnose and treat the disease at an earlier stage and has the potential to help control the spread of infectious TB. The benefits and limitations of this non-automated test are still being evaluated in resource-limited countries with high prevalence of TB.
There are other new methods being used in some laboratories that can identify M. tuberculosis very rapidly and accurately once the mycobacteria is growing in culture.



",,"



AFB testing may be used to detect several different types of acid-fast bacilli, but it is most commonly used to identify an active tuberculosis (TB) infection.
Mycobacteria are called acid-fast bacilli because they are rod-shaped bacteria (bacilli) that can be seen under the microscope following a staining procedure in which the bacteria retain the color of the stain after an acid wash (acid-fast).
A few different tests may be used to help identify AFB as the cause of an infection:

AFB smear—a microscopic examination of a person's sputum or other specimen that is stained to detect acid-fast bacteria. It is a rapid test used to provide presumptive results within one to two days. It is valuable in helping to make decisions about treatment while waiting for culture results. However, AFB smears must be confirmed with AFB cultures.
Molecular tests for TB (nucleic acid amplification test or NAAT) detect the genetic material of mycobacteria. These tests are often used when the AFB smear is positive or TB is highly suspected. Like AFB smears, they can provide a presumptive diagnosis, which can aid in the decision of whether to begin treatment and isolate potentially infectious people before culture results are available. Results of NAAT are typically available in one to three days after a sample is collected. Molecular methods are approved for use with respiratory samples but must be confirmed with an AFB culture. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that people with signs and symptoms of TB have at least one sample tested using nucleic acid amplification with AFB smear and culture. The NAAT test currently available is done directly on sputum samples and can simultaneously detect TB and its resistance to rifampicin in less than two hours. Rifampicin is a common treatment for TB.
AFB cultures are used to diagnose active M. tuberculosis infections as well as infections due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. AFB cultures can also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and can help determine when a person is no longer infectious. Though culture is more sensitive than an AFB smear, positive results may take days to several weeks, while negative culture results (no mycobacterial growth) can take up to 6 to 8 weeks to confirm.
Susceptibility testing is usually ordered in conjunction with an AFB culture to determine the most effective antibiotic to treat the mycobacterial infection. M. tuberculosis may be resistant to one or more drugs commonly used to treat TB.

acth-stimulation-test,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) stimulation test', 'Cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) stimulation test', 'Corticotropin test', 'ACTH stim test', 'ACTH challenge test']","

Follow directions given to you by your healthcare practitioner. In some cases, you may be instructed to refrain from taking certain medications on the day of testing.


",,,"



Although the ACTH stimulation test name sounds as though it would measure adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), it is actually a procedure used to evaluate cortisol production and to help diagnose adrenal insufficiency.
Cortisol is a hormone produced by two small glands that sit atop the kidneys called the adrenal glands. Cortisol plays a role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. It affects blood glucose levels, helps maintain blood pressure, and helps regulate the immune system. Normally, the level of cortisol in the blood rises and falls in a consistent pattern throughout the day (called diurnal variation), peaking shortly after waking, then declining gradually to its lowest level at bedtime.
Production of cortisol by the adrenal glands is regulated by a negative feedback system involving the hypothalamus in the brain and the pituitary gland, a small organ located below the brain. Normally, in a healthy person:

When the cortisol level falls, the hypothalamus responds by releasing corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH).
CRH signals the pituitary gland to produce ACTH.
ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol.
As the cortisol level rises, the hypothalamus decreases CRH production, the pituitary reduces ACTH production, and the adrenal glands decrease cortisol production.

In order for appropriate amounts of cortisol to be made, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands must be functioning and communicating with each other properly.
Decreased cortisol levels may be seen with:

Underactive or damaged adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency) that limit cortisol production; this is referred to as primary adrenal insufficiency and is also known as Addison disease.
An underactive pituitary gland or a pituitary gland tumor that inhibits ACTH production; this is known as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Treatment utilizing glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone and prednisone.

If you have a cortisol test done and the result is low, your healthcare practitioner may do an ACTH stimulation test to help confirm the findings and to help determine its cause.
The most common ACTH stimulation test is the short or rapid test. For this test:

Your blood is drawn for an initial, baseline level (pre-stimulation).
You are given an injection of a manufactured fragment of ACTH (cosyntropin or tetracosactide). The manufactured fragment may be injected into a muscle or vein. When the manufactured ACTH fragment is administered, it acts like the body's own ACTH and stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol.
Your blood is drawn again after a specified amount of time (30 minutes and/or 60 minutes).
The cortisol level is measured in both the first (baseline) and subsequent samples.

2016 guidelines from the Endocrine Society consider this the best test to establish a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency.

",,"



The ACTH stimulation test may be ordered when you have a low result on a cortisol test and a combination of signs and symptoms that suggest low cortisol or adrenal insufficiency, such as:

Weight loss
Muscle weakness
Fatigue
Low blood pressure
Abdominal pain
Dark patches of skin (this occurs in Addison disease but not secondary adrenal insufficiency)
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia, especially in children)




","



If your adrenal glands are functioning normally, then your cortisol level will rise in response to the ACTH you are given. (The cortisol level in the second sample drawn should be elevated above a certain level and to a certain degree when compared to the baseline sample.) This result rules out primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease).
If your adrenal glands are damaged or not functioning properly, then your cortisol level will not increase after you are given ACTH. You may be diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency. Additional testing may be necessary to identify the cause.
The ACTH stimulation test is not a definitive test for adrenal insufficiency due to pituitary damage. If injury to the pituitary occurred only in the previous few weeks, a falsely normal response to ACTH injection may be observed. A repeat ACTH stimulation test 6 to 8 weeks later might then reveal secondary adrenal insufficiency. Other tests may also be considered.
Rarely, there is a problem with the hypothalamus and the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The ACTH stimulation test does not distinguish this problem from other causes of adrenal insufficiency.



","



Once your healthcare practitioner has identified a problem associated with the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, or other cause, other testing such as CT (computerized tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans may be performed to locate the source of the problem and to evaluate the extent of any damage to the glands. For more details about these imaging scans, see RadiologyInfo.org.
Since the ACTH stimulation test involves giving an injection of manufactured ACTH, the test can interfere with subsequent tests that measure ACTH levels. Therefore, ACTH testing is not recommended for several hours following an ACTH stimulation test.



","



The ACTH stimulation test may be used to investigate a low cortisol test result. It may be used to help diagnose primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) if your healthcare practitioner suspects that your adrenal glands may not be producing enough cortisol. The test may also be done to help determine whether a condition affecting the pituitary gland is causing low cortisol levels (secondary adrenal insufficiency).
This test is used to determine whether your adrenal glands are capable of responding to ACTH and whether this is a typical response.
The Endocrine Society recommends using tests for ACTH, aldosterone (also produced by the adrenal glands) and renin (a hormone that controls aldosterone production) as part of the evaluation for primary adrenal insufficiency.

None


","

To monitor treatment with heparin or other blood-thinning medications (anticoagulants) when undergoing heart bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty, or dialysis


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



The activated clotting time (ACT) is a test that is used primarily to monitor high doses of unfractionated (standard) heparin therapy. Heparin is a drug that inhibits blood clotting (anticoagulant) and is usually given through a vein (intravenously, IV), by injection or continuous infusion. High doses of heparin may be given during medical or surgical procedures that require that blood be prevented from clotting, such as heart bypass surgery.
In moderate doses, heparin is used to help prevent and treat inappropriate blood clot formation (thrombosis or thromboembolism) and is monitored using the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) or the heparin anti-factor Xa test. Monitoring is a vital part of the anticoagulation therapy because the blood thinning (anticoagulant) effect of heparin can affect each person a little bit differently. If the amount of heparin administered is not enough to inhibit the body's clotting system, blood clots may form in blood vessels throughout the body. If there is too much heparin, excessive, even life-threatening, bleeding can occur.
High doses of heparin are given, for example, before, during, and for a short time after, open heart surgeries. During these operations, the patient's heart and lungs are often bypassed. This means their blood is filtered and oxygenated outside of the body using mechanical devices. The blood's contact with artificial surfaces activates platelets and coagulation, initiating a sequence of steps that results in blood clot formation. A high dose of heparin prevents clot formation but leaves the body in a delicate dynamic balance between clotting and bleeding. At this level of anticoagulation, the PTT is no longer clinically useful as a monitoring tool. The PTT test involves an in vitro clotting reaction and at high levels of heparin, it will not clot. In these cases, the ACT must be used for monitoring.

","

When you are receiving high doses of heparin to prevent clotting during and after surgical procedures such as a heart bypass; when heparin levels are too high to allow monitoring with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and/or when a rapid result is necessary to monitor treatment


","



The ACT is ordered after an initial dose (bolus) of heparin and before the start of an open heart surgery or other procedure that requires a high level of anticoagulation. During surgery, the ACT is measured at intervals to achieve and maintain a steady level of heparin anticoagulation. After surgery, the ACT is monitored until the person has stabilized and the heparin dosage has been reduced and/or neutralized with a counter agent such as protamine sulfate.
Occasionally, the ACT may be measured during a bleeding episode or used as part of a bedside evaluation of a person's heparin anticoagulation level, particularly if the person has lupus anticoagulant (LAC).
It may also be used when someone is receiving direct thrombin inhibitor therapy (e.g., argatroban).



","



The ACT is measured in seconds: the longer the time to clot, the higher the degree of clotting inhibition (anticoagulation). During surgery, the ACT is kept above a lower time limit, a limit at which most people will not form blood clots. There is no widespread agreement of exactly what this lower limit should be. It will vary from hospital to hospital and depends to some degree on the method used to determine ACT.
It is important to evaluate how the person is responding to this ACT lower limit and to the amount of heparin that person is being given. The amount of heparin needed to reach and maintain a certain ACT (for instance, 300 seconds) will vary as will the body's clotting potential at that ACT. If there are clotting or bleeding problems, the dosages and ACT may need to be adjusted accordingly. After surgery, the ACT may be maintained within a narrow range (for instance, 175-225 seconds) until the person has stabilized.



","



The ACT and PTT results are not interchangeable. In the area where they overlap (upper measurements of PTT and lower levels of ACT), they have poor correlation. ACT and PTT results should be evaluated independently. It is better to determine someone's heparin anticoagulant requirements, stabilize the person, and then change the monitoring tool.
The ACT may be influenced by a person's platelet count and platelet function. Platelets that are activated during surgery often become dysfunctional, and both surgery and heparin can sometimes cause platelet numbers to decrease (thrombocytopenia).
The temperature of the blood may also affect ACT results; the blood tends to cool during surgery as it is mechanically filtered and oxygenated. Acquired and inherited conditions such as coagulation factor deficiencies and in patients receiving oral anticoagulants or with liver disease may also affect ACT results.
With high doses of heparin and in individuals with a prolonged PTT prior to heparin anticoagulation (e.g., lupus anticoagulant), the PTT cannot be used to monitor heparin therapy. In such situations, the ACT and Heparin Anti-Xa tests are used instead of the PTT, respectively.
Direct Thrombin Inhibitors (e.g., argatroban) will prolong the ACT.



","



The activated clotting time (ACT) is commonly used to monitor treatment with high-dose heparin before, during, and for a short time after medical or surgical procedures that require that blood be prevented from clotting, such as heart bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty, and dialysis.
The ACT is a rapid test that can be performed at the patient's bedside prior to surgery or other medical procedures. It can also be done in or near the operating room at intervals during and immediately after surgery. (This type of testing is known as point-of-care testing.) ACT testing allows measurement of relatively rapid changes in heparin infusion, helping to achieve and maintain a constant level of anticoagulation throughout the surgical or medical procedure. Once the procedure is complete and the patient has been stabilized, heparin doses are typically decreased.
The ACT measures the inhibiting effect that heparin has on the body's clotting system, not the actual level of heparin in the blood. The sensitivity of the ACT test to heparin depends on the method used. Some ACT tests are designed to monitor lower levels of heparin while others are best at monitoring high levels of heparin. When heparin reaches therapeutic maintenance levels, the ACT is usually replaced as a monitoring tool by the PTT.
The ACT test is also sometimes used to monitor regular-dose heparin therapy in people with documented lupus anticoagulant (LAC). The PTT test cannot be used in those patients because LAC interferes with the PTT. In rare clinical situations, the ACT test may also be used to monitor the inhibiting effect of a different class of anticoagulation drugs called direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., argatroban) on the clotting system.

To detect and diagnose an infection with a hepatitis virus


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Hepatitis is an inflammation and enlargement of the liver. One of the most common causes of acute hepatitis is infection with a hepatitis virus, usually hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C. An acute viral hepatitis panel is a group of blood tests often performed together to help diagnose viral hepatitis. Some of the tests detect antibodies produced by the immune system in response to the infection and one detects proteins (antigens) that indicate the presence of the virus.
A hepatitis panel typically includes:

Hepatitis A antibody, IgM
Hepatitis B tesing: Hepatitis B core antibody, IgM and Hepatitis B surface Ag
Hepatitis C antibody

See ""How is the test used?"" under Common Questions below for more details.
If acute symptoms are suspected to be caused by one of the hepatitis viruses or if someone is at an increased risk of being infected or has been exposed, then a hepatitis panel can help determine if the person has been infected and which virus is present.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is highly contagious and is usually contracted by ingesting food or water contaminated with the virus or by coming in contact with an infected person. While hepatitis A infections are usually mild, the virus can on rare occasions cause a severe, acute disease. Hepatitis A does not cause a chronic infection, as do hepatitis B and C. A vaccine is available to prevent hepatitis A.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis. It is spread through contact with blood or other body fluids from an infected person. Exposure can occur, for example, through sharing of needles for intravenous drug use or through unprotected sex. People who live in or travel to areas of the world where hepatitis B is prevalent are at a greater risk. Rarely, mothers can pass the infection to their babies, usually during birth. The virus, however, is not spread through food or water, casual contact such as holding hands, or coughing or sneezing. A vaccine can be given to protect against hepatitis B.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is also spread by exposure to contaminated blood, primarily though the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users, but also by sharing personal items contaminated by blood such as razors, through sex with an infected person, via healthcare occupational exposure, and from mother to baby during childbirth. Before tests for HCV became available in the 1990s, HCV was often transmitted by blood transfusions. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection with HCV.

An acute viral hepatitis panel may be ordered when a person has had blood tests done as part of a health checkup that show abnormal results on liver tests or when someone has acute symptoms associated with liver damage, such as:

Fever, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
Dark urine and/or pale colored stool
Joint pain
Jaundice
Itching (pruritus)

The acute viral hepatitis panel may sometimes be used to screen people when they are at an increased risk for hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or when it is known that they have been exposed. Below are listed some examples of who may be screened using the panel:

People who have elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) with no known cause
People who inject illegal drugs
People with sexually transmitted diseases
Men who have sex with men
People with certain medical conditions that require that their immune system be suppressed (for example, transplant recipients)
People who are in close contact with someone infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis C
Those infected with HIV
People who received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 or clotting factor produced before 1987
People on long-term dialysis
Children born to hepatitis B- or hepatitis C-positive women
For hepatitis B, people who were born in areas of the world where the virus is common, which includes Asia, Africa, southern Europe and parts of South America
People with evidence of chronic liver disease
For hepatitis C, per a 2012 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation, to help identify chronic hepatitis C infections in persons born during 1945-1965 as they are considered at an increased risk

If other hepatitis tests are performed to help determine prior exposure or previous infection, they may indicate the following:

Hepatitis A antibody, total (IgM and IgG) — if negative, no current or previous HAV infection; if positive, indicates exposure to HAV or the HAV vaccine. An IgM test must be done if an acute infection is suspected.
Hepatitis B core antibody, total (IgM and IgG) — a positive test can indicate exposure to the virus. An IgM test must be performed if an acute infection is suspected.
Hepatitis B surface antibody — if positive, it indicates that a HBV infection has resolved; depending on results of other HBV tests, a negative result may indicate that an infection has not resolved. Hepatitis B surface antibody will also be positive with a negative hepatitis B core antibody after a person has received a hepatitis B vaccine. (For more on this, see Hepatitis B Testing.)

It is possible to be infected with more than one hepatitis virus, and an acute infection with one hepatitis virus can be superimposed on a chronic infection with a different hepatitis virus. In such cases, there may be a positive result for more than one type of virus and care must be taken when interpreting the results.
If all the viral tests are negative, then the antibody or antigen level is too low to detect or the hepatitis is due to some other cause. For more on this and other tests that may be done to determine the cause, see the article on Hepatitis.



","



The tests that are typically included in an acute viral hepatitis panel may not always be able to tell whether someone has had a previous hepatitis infection or has developed antibodies in response to a vaccine. Usually other types of tests are performed to provide this type of information. See the individual articles on Hepatitis A Testing, Hepatitis B Testing or Hepatitis C Testing for more on this.
The presence of hepatitis A IgM antibodies in the blood are considered diagnostic for acute infection with hepatitis A when the test information is combined with a person's signs and symptoms. When the hepatitis screening test is performed for people who do not have symptoms of acute hepatitis, the presence of hepatitis A IgM antibodies may represent a false-positive result. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended against using the test for screening in people without acute hepatitis symptoms to decrease the possibility of false-positive results.



","



An acute viral hepatitis panel is used to help detect and/or diagnose acute liver infection and inflammation that is due to one of the three most common hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV).
There are several causes of hepatitis and the accompanying symptoms, so these tests are used to determine if symptoms are due to a current infection with a virus and to identify which virus in particular is causing the disease. These tests may also help determine if someone has been exposed to one of the viruses even before symptoms develop.
An acute viral hepatitis panel typically consists of the following tests:

Hepatitis A antibody, IgM—these antibodies typically develop early in a hepatitis A infection, about 2 to 3 weeks after a person is first infected and persist for about 2 to 6 months. A positive hepatitis A IgM test is usually considered diagnostic for acute hepatitis A in a person with signs and symptoms.
Hepatitis B testing  
	
Hepatitis B core antibody, IgM—this is the first antibody produced in response to a hepatitis B infection and, when detected, may indicate an acute infection. It may also be present in people with chronic hepatitis B when flares of disease activity occur.
Hepatitis B surface Ag—this is a protein present on the surface of the hepatitis B virus. It is the earliest indicator of an acute infection but may also be present in the blood of people with chronic hepatitis B.


Hepatitis C antibody—this test detects antibodies produced in response to a hepatitis C infection. It cannot distinguish between an active or previous infection. If positive, it is typically followed up with other tests to determine if the infection is a current one. (See the article on Hepatitis C Testing for more on this.)

There are some other tests that may be offered as part of a hepatitis panel, depending on the laboratory performing the tests. These may include:

Hepatitis A antibody, total and Hepatitis B core antibody, total—these tests detect both IgM and IgG antibodies and may be used as part of the panel to determine if someone has had a previous infection.
Hepatitis B surface antibody—the test for this antibody may sometimes be included in a panel to help determine if an infection has resolved or if a person has developed the antibody after receiving the hepatitis B vaccine and achieved immunity for protection against HBV.

adenosine-deaminase,['ADA'],"

","

To help detect or rule out a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in pleural fluid in order to assist in the diagnosis of tuberculosis; rarely to detect the infection in other body fluids such as peritoneal fluid or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)


","

A volume of pleural fluid is collected by a healthcare practitioner using a procedure called thoracentesis; other body fluids are collected using other procedures


","



Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a protein that is produced by cells throughout the body and is associated with the activation of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that plays a role in the immune response to infections. Conditions that trigger the immune system, such as an infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB), may cause increased amounts of ADA to be produced in the areas where the bacteria are present. This test measures the amount of adenosine deaminase present in pleural fluid in order to help diagnose a tuberculosis infection of the pleurae.
Pleurae are membranes that cover the chest cavity and the outside of each lung. Small amounts of pleural fluid are continuously produced to lubricate the movement of the lungs against these membranes and the membranes against each other during inhalation and exhalation. A variety of conditions and diseases, including infection, can cause inflammation of the pleurae (pleurisy or pleuritis) and can lead to excessive pleural fluid accumulation (pleural effusion).
Tuberculosis can spread into the lungs and pleurae, causing symptoms such as chest pain, chronic cough, and shortness of breath. Since these symptoms may also be seen with a variety of other conditions, it is important to determine the cause as rapidly as possible in order to properly treat the affected person. Detecting mycobacteria in pleural fluid can be difficult because there may be a large volume of fluid and very low numbers of bacteria present. Though the ADA test is not specific and does not replace the culture for diagnosing TB, it may be positive even when numbers of bacteria are very low and can be used as an adjunct test to help determine whether tuberculosis is the likely source of a person's symptoms.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A sample of pleural fluid is collected by a healthcare practitioner with a syringe and needle using a procedure called thoracentesis. Rarely, other body fluid samples, such as peritoneal or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), are collected using procedures specific to the fluid type.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone with chest pain, coughing, and/or difficulty breathing has tuberculosis that has spread to their pleurae (lining around the lungs)


","



An ADA test may be ordered when a person has an accumulation of fluid in the chest cavity (pleural fluid) and has signs or symptoms that suggest TB, such as:

Chronic cough, sometimes with bloody sputum
Fever, chills
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Chest pain
	 

This test may be ordered as one of several tests to help rule in or rule out TB as the cause of a person's symptoms, especially if the individual falls into a high-risk group, such as:

People with close contact with someone who has active infectious TB
Immigrants from areas of the world where the incidence of TB is high
Children younger than 5 years old who have a positive TB screening test
People who work with or are part of groups with high rates of infection, such as the homeless, IV drug users or confined populations, such as hospitalized patients, prisoners, and residents of nursing homes
People with weakened immune systems such as:
	
Those with HIV/AIDS
Those with chronic underlying conditions, including diabetes and kidney disease
Organ transplant recipients and others on immunosuppressant drugs
Pregnant women
The elderly
		 



Testing may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether a person likely has tuberculosis, in advance of other test results, in order to initiate treatment.



","



If adenosine deaminase (ADA) is markedly elevated in pleural fluid in a person with signs and symptoms that suggest tuberculosis, then it is likely that the person tested has a M. tuberculosis infection in their pleurae. This is especially true when there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis in the geographic region where a person lives.
When there is a low prevalence of tuberculosis in a region, then a person may have tuberculosis or may have an ADA result that is elevated for another reason, such as cancer (particularly lymphomas), pulmonary embolus, sarcoidosis, or lupus. These other diagnoses are more likely if the ADA result is only mildly or moderately elevated.
A person with a low ADA level is unlikely to have tuberculosis in their pleurae. This does not rule out having the infection in other parts of their body.
If ADA is markedly elevated in fluid from another part of the body, such as peritoneal fluid or CSF, then there is an increased likelihood that tuberculosis is present in this area.



","



The ADA test cannot positively identify M. tuberculosis as the cause of a person's symptoms, and the test results cannot be used to determine if the person has drug-resistant tuberculosis.



",,"



The adenosine deaminase (ADA) test is not a diagnostic test, but it may be used along with other tests such as pleural fluid analysis, acid-fast bacillus (AFB) smear and culture, and/or tuberculosis molecular testing to help determine whether a person has a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis or TB) of the lining of the lungs (pleurae).
A culture is considered the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing tuberculosis and guiding treatment, but it may take several days to weeks to complete. Molecular testing and the AFB smear are rapid tests, but they require that a sufficient number of microorganisms be present in the fluid to detect them. Pleural fluid presents a unique problem with detecting M. tuberculosis because there may be a large volume of fluid with a very low number of bacteria present. Though the ADA test is not definitive, it is a rapid test and may be elevated even when there are few bacteria present. ADA results may be used to help guide treatment until results from a culture are available.
The ADA test is used as an adjunct test to help rule in or rule out tuberculosis in pleural fluid. Rarely, it may be ordered to detect tuberculosis in other body fluids, such as peritoneal fluid or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a hormone that stimulates the production of cortisol. Cortisol is a steroid hormone made by the adrenal glands that is important for regulating glucose, protein, and lipid metabolism, suppressing the immune system's response, and helping to maintain blood pressure. This test measures the amount of ACTH in the blood.
ACTH is produced by the pituitary gland. Located below the brain in the center of the head, the pituitary gland is part of the endocrine system, a network of glands that work together to produce hormones that act on organs, tissues, and other glands to regulate systems throughout the body.
Normally, ACTH levels increase when cortisol is low and fall when cortisol is high. In response to a fall in the blood cortisol level, the hypothalamus produces corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). This stimulates the production of ACTH by the pituitary, which in turn stimulates the production of cortisol by the adrenal glands, small organs located at the top of each kidney. To make the appropriate amounts of cortisol, the hypothalamus, pituitary, and adrenal glands must be functioning properly.
Conditions that affect the hypothalamus, pituitary, or adrenal glands can interfere with regulating ACTH and cortisol production, increasing or decreasing how much of the hormones the glands produce. This can cause signs and symptoms associated with an excess or deficiency of cortisol. Conditions that affect ACTH include Cushing disease, adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), and hypopituitarism. Some tumors found outside of the pituitary in locations such as the lungs can also increase cortisol concentrations by producing ACTH.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is drawn by needle from a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
The healthcare practitioner may request that you fast overnight before testing. Blood is typically drawn in the morning, about 8 a.m.

When you have signs and symptoms associated with excess or deficient cortisol production; when your healthcare provider suspects that you have a hormone imbalance that could be caused by a problem with your pituitary or adrenal glands


","



An ACTH test may be ordered after a cortisol test reveals abnormal results and when someone has signs or symptoms associated with excess or deficient cortisol.
Too much cortisol can cause symptoms that include:

Obesity, with majority of the weight on the trunk of the body and not the arms and legs
Fat collection between the shoulders
Rounded, red face
Fragile and thin skin
Purple lines on the abdomen
Muscle weakness
Acne
Skin infections
Increased body hair
Fatigue

These are often accompanied by findings such as high blood pressure, low potassium, high bicarbonate, high glucose levels, and sometimes diabetes.
People with insufficient cortisol production may exhibit symptoms such as:

Muscle weakness
Fatigue
Weight loss
Increased skin pigmentation, even in areas not exposed to the sun
Loss of appetite
Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting
Dizziness
Salt cravings

These are often accompanied by findings such as low blood pressure, low blood glucose, low sodium, high potassium, and high calcium.
Symptoms suggestive of hypopituitarism typically include several of the following:

Loss of appetite
Fatigue
Irregular menstrual cycle
Dysfunction of sex organs (hypogonadism)
Decreased sex drive
Frequent nighttime urination
Unexplained weight loss
Hot flashes
Cold sensitivity

When the condition is due to a pituitary tumor (usually benign), the affected person may also have symptoms associated with the compression of nearby cells and nerves. For example, the tumor can cause a change in a pattern of headaches. It can also affect the nerves controlling vision, causing symptoms such as ""tunnel vision"" (inability to see things off to the side), loss of vision to some localized areas, or double vision.



","



In many cases, the interpretation of the results can be complex. Levels of both ACTH and cortisol vary throughout the day. Normally, ACTH will be at its highest level in the morning and lowest at night. It will stimulate cortisol production, which will follow the same daily pattern but will rise after ACTH does and fall to its lowest level very late in the evening. Conditions that affect the production of ACTH and cortisol often disrupt this diurnal variation.
Results of ACTH and cortisol tests are often evaluated together. The table below indicates the common patterns of ACTH and cortisol seen with different diseases involving the adrenal and pituitary glands.



Disease
Cortisol
ACTH




Cushing disease (pituitary tumor producing ACTH)
Increased

Adrenal tumor
Increased

""Ectopic"" ACTH (ACTH made by a tumor outside the pituitary, usually in the lung)
Increased
Increased


Addison disease (underactive or damaged adrenal glands)
Decreased

Hypopituitarism
Decreased
Decreased or normal



An increased ACTH result can mean that a person has Cushing disease, Addison disease, overactive, tumor-forming endocrine glands (multiple endocrine neoplasia), or ectopic ACTH-producing tumors.
A decreased ACTH result can be due to an adrenal tumor, steroid medication, or hypopituitarism.
It is impossible to reliably distinguish Cushing disease and ectopic ACTH from cortisol and ACTH measurement alone. A variety of other tests are often used to assist healthcare practitioners in making this distinction. Testing the change in the level of cortisol when certain drugs are given to stimulate or suppress hormone production often helps the healthcare practitioner make the right diagnosis. To learn more, read the Cortisol article.



","



While ACTH is still used to diagnose adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease), the ACTH stimulation test is the preferred diagnostic test, when available.
Taking certain medications such as any steroid, oral, inhaled, topical or eye drop may cause abnormal results. Megestrol acetate can also cause abnormal results. Mifepristone (RU486) is a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist and, as such, likely causes changes to ACTH levels.
Stress may increase ACTH secretion.
ACTH has also been used therapeutically as a drug to treat multiple sclerosis and infantile spasms.



",,"



ACTH blood tests are used, usually in conjunction with cortisol tests, to help detect, diagnose, and monitor conditions associated with excessive or deficient cortisol in the body. These conditions include:

Cushing disease: excess cortisol that is due to an ACTH-producing tumor in the pituitary gland (usually a benign tumor)
Cushing syndrome: refers to the symptoms and signs associated with excess cortisol; in addition to Cushing disease, Cushing syndrome may be due to an adrenal tumor, adrenal hyperplasia, the use of steroid medications, or due to an ACTH-producing tumor located outside the pituitary (ectopic), such as in the lungs.
Addison disease (primary adrenal insufficiency): decreased cortisol production due to adrenal gland damage
Secondary adrenal insufficiency: decreased cortisol production because of pituitary dysfunction
Hypopituitarism: pituitary dysfunction or damage that leads to decreased (or no) hormone production by the pituitary, including ACTH production

Measuring both ACTH and cortisol can help to differentiate among some of these conditions because the level of ACTH normally changes in the opposite direction to the level of cortisol.
If abnormal levels are detected, a healthcare practitioner will do additional testing to help confirm the findings and help determine the cause. For additional details on these tests, read the Cortisol article.

alanine-aminotransferase-alt,"['ALT', 'Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase', 'SGPT', 'GPT', 'Alanine Transaminase']","

None


","

To screen for liver damage and/or to help diagnose liver disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found mostly in the cells of the liver and kidney. Much smaller amounts of it are also found in the heart and muscles. Normally, ALT levels in blood are low, but when the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood and the level increases. This test measures the level of ALT in the blood and is useful for early detection of liver disease.
The function of ALT is to convert alanine, an amino acid found in proteins, into pyruvate, an important intermediate in cellular energy production. In healthy individuals, ALT levels in the blood are low. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the blood, usually before more obvious signs of liver damage occur, such as jaundice.
The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right side of the abdomen, just beneath the rib cage. It is involved in many important functions in the body. The liver helps to process the body's nutrients, manufactures bile to help digest fats, produces many important proteins such as blood clotting factors and albumin, and breaks down potentially toxic substances into harmless ones that the body can use or eliminate.
A number of conditions can cause damage to liver cells, resulting in an increase in ALT. The test is most useful in detecting damage due to hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) or as a result of drugs or other substances that are toxic to the liver.
ALT is commonly tested in conjunction with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), another liver enzyme, as part of a liver panel. Both ALT and AST levels usually rise whenever the liver is being damaged, although ALT is more specific for the liver and, in some cases, may be the only one of the two to be increased. An AST/ALT ratio may be calculated to aid in distinguishing between different causes and severity of liver injury and to help distinguish liver injury from damage to heart or muscles.

When a healthcare practitioner thinks that you have symptoms of a liver disorder, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, jaundice (yellowish discoloration of the skin or white of the sclerae), or potential exposure to hepatitis viruses; it can also be ordered as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) when you have a routine health exam.


","



ALT may be ordered as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel when you have a routine health examination.
A healthcare practitioner usually orders an ALT test (and several others) when you have signs and symptoms of a liver disorder. Some of these signs and symptoms may include:

Weakness, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Abdominal distension/fullness and/or pain
Jaundice (icterus)
Dark urine or tea-colored urine 
Light-colored stool or clay-colored stool
Skin itchiness (pruritus)

ALT may also be ordered, either by itself or with other tests, when you have an increased risk for liver disease. This is because many people with mild liver damage will have no signs or symptoms. Even without symptoms, ALT can be increased with mild liver damage. You may be at risk of liver disease when you:

Have a history of known or possible exposure to hepatitis viruses
Are a heavy alcohol drinker
Have a family history of liver disease
Take drugs that might damage the liver, such as acetaminophen
Are overweight, obese and/or have diabetes or metabolic syndrome

ALT may be ordered on a regular basis when it is used to monitor the treatment of liver disease.



","



A low level of ALT in the blood is expected and is normal. Liver disease is the most common reason for higher than normal levels of ALT.
Very high levels of ALT (more than 10 times normal) are usually due to acute hepatitis, sometimes due to a viral hepatitis infection. In acute hepatitis, ALT levels usually stay high for about 1-2 months but can take as long as 3-6 months to return to normal. Levels of ALT may also be markedly elevated (sometimes over 100 times normal) as a result of exposure to drugs or other substances that are toxic to the liver or in conditions that cause decreased blood flow to the liver.
ALT levels are usually not much elevated in chronic hepatitis, often less than 4 times normal. In this case, ALT levels often vary between normal and slightly increased, so the test may be ordered frequently to see if there is a pattern. Other causes of moderate increases in ALT include obstruction of bile ducts, cirrhosis (usually the result of chronic hepatitis or bile duct obstruction), heart damage, alcohol abuse, and with tumors in the liver.
ALT is often performed together with a test for AST or as part of a liver panel. For more about ALT results in relation to other liver tests, see the Liver Panel article.
In certain types of liver diseases, the ALT level is higher than AST and the AST/ALT ratio will be low (less than 1). There are a few exceptions; the AST/ALT ratio is usually greater than 1 in alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and with heart or muscle injury and may be greater than 1 for a day or two after onset of acute hepatitis.



","



A shot or injection of medicine into the muscle tissue, or strenuous exercise, may increase ALT levels.
Many drugs may raise ALT levels by causing liver damage in a very small percentage of patients taking the drug. This is true of both prescription drugs and some ""natural"" health products. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all of the drugs and/or health supplements you are taking.



","



The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is typically used to detect liver injury. It is often ordered in conjunction with aspartate aminotransferase (AST) as part of a liver panel or comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to screen for and/or help diagnose liver disease.
AST and ALT are considered to be two of the most important tests to detect liver injury, although ALT is more specific to the liver than is AST. Sometimes AST is compared directly to ALT and an AST/ALT ratio is calculated. This ratio may be used to distinguish between different causes of liver damage and to help recognize heart or muscle injury.
ALT values are often compared to the results of other tests such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), total protein, albumin-to-globulin ratio (A/G ratio), and bilirubin to help determine which form of liver disease is present.
ALT is often used to monitor the treatment of liver disease, to see if the treatment is working, and may be ordered either by itself or along with other tests for this purpose.

To screen for and help diagnose a liver disorder or kidney disease; sometimes to evaluate nutritional status, especially in hospitalized patients


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Albumin is a protein made by the liver. It makes up about 60% of the total protein in the blood and plays many roles. This test measures the level of albumin in the blood.
Albumin keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, nourishes tissues, and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, and substances like calcium throughout the body. Levels of albumin may decrease, to a greater or lesser degree, when conditions interfere with its production by the liver, increase protein breakdown, increase protein loss via the kidneys, and/or expand the volume of plasma, the liquid portion of blood (diluting the blood).
Two important causes of low blood albumin include:

Severe liver disease—since albumin is produced by the liver, its level can decrease with loss of liver function; however, this typically occurs only when the liver has been severely affected.
Kidney disease—one of the many functions of the kidneys is to conserve plasma proteins such as albumin so that they are not released along with waste products when urine is produced. Albumin is present in high concentrations in the blood, and when the kidneys are functioning properly, virtually no albumin is lost in the urine. However, if a person's kidneys become damaged or diseased, they begin to lose their ability to conserve albumin and other proteins. This is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. In nephrotic syndrome, very high amounts of albumin are lost through the kidneys.

Albumin may be ordered, along with other tests, when you have signs and symptoms of a liver disorder, such as:

Yellowing of eyes or skin (jaundice)
Weakness, fatigue
Unexplained weight loss
Loss of appetite
Abdominal swelling and/or pain
Dark urine, light-colored stool

This test may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome, such as:

Swelling or puffiness, particularly around the eyes or in the face, wrists, abdomen, thighs or ankles
Urine that is foamy, bloody, or coffee-colored
A decrease in the amount of urine
Problems urinating, such as a burning feeling or abnormal discharge during urination, or a change in the frequency of urination, especially at night
Mid-back pain (flank), below the ribs, near where the kidneys are located
High blood pressure (hypertension)

A healthcare practitioner may also order an albumin test to check or monitor your nutritional status. However, since albumin levels respond to a variety of conditions in addition to malnutrition, a decrease in albumin needs to be evaluated carefully.



","



Results of albumin testing are evaluated along with those from other tests done at the same time, such as the tests included in a CMP, basic metabolic panel (BMP), liver panel, or renal panel.
A low albumin level may be an indication that further investigation may be warranted. A low albumin may reflect a temporary condition that will resolve itself or may suggest an acute or chronic condition that requires treatment.
Levels of albumin may decrease, to a greater or lesser degree, when conditions interfere with its production, increase protein breakdown, increase protein loss, and/or expand plasma volume (diluting the blood). Depending on your medical history, signs and symptoms, and physical exam, additional testing may be done to investigate a low result.
A low albumin can suggest liver disease. Liver enzyme tests or a liver panel may be ordered to determine exactly which type of liver disease may be present. A person may, however, have normal or near normal albumin levels with liver disease until the condition has reached an advanced stage. For example, in people with cirrhosis, albumin is typically (but not always) low whereas in most chronic liver diseases that have not progressed to cirrhosis, albumin is usually normal.
Low albumin levels can reflect kidney diseases in which the kidneys cannot prevent albumin from leaking from the blood into the urine and being lost. In this case, the amount of albumin or protein in the urine also may be measured (see Urine Albumin) or tests for creatinine and BUN or a renal panel may be ordered.
Low albumin levels can also be seen in inflammation, shock, and malnutrition. They may be seen with conditions in which the body does not properly absorb and digest protein, such as Crohn disease or celiac disease, or in which large volumes of protein are lost from the intestines.
A low albumin may also be seen in several other conditions, such as:

Infection
Burns
Surgery
Chronic illness
Cancer
Diabetes
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Carcinoid syndrome
Increase in blood volume due to congestive heart failure, sometimes pregnancy

High albumin levels can be seen with dehydration, although the test is not typically used to monitor or detect this condition.



","



Certain drugs increase albumin in the blood, including anabolic steroids, androgens, growth hormones, and insulin.
If someone is receiving large amounts of intravenous fluids, the results of this test may be inaccurate.



","



An albumin test may be used, along with other tests included in panels such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), to help evaluate your overall health status. These tests may also be used to help diagnose diseases and to monitor conditions or treatments. Albumin levels can be low in many different diseases and disorders. Abnormal results may indicate the need further testing.
Additionally, an albumin test may be ordered as part of a liver panel to evaluate liver function or with a creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or renal panel to evaluate kidney function. Albumin may also be ordered to evaluate a person's nutritional status.

","



Aldosterone is a hormone that plays an important role in maintaining normal sodium and potassium concentrations in blood and in controlling blood volume and blood pressure. Renin is an enzyme that controls aldosterone production. These tests measure the levels of aldosterone and renin in the blood and/or the level of aldosterone in urine.
Aldosterone is produced by the adrenal glands located at the top of each kidney, in their outer portion (called the adrenal cortex). Aldosterone stimulates the retention of sodium (salt) and the elimination of potassium by the kidneys. Renin is produced by the kidneys and controls the activation of the hormone angiotensin, which stimulates the adrenal glands to produce aldosterone.
The kidneys release renin when there is a drop in blood pressure or a decrease in sodium chloride concentration in the tubules in the kidney. Renin cleaves the blood protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I, which is then converted by a second enzyme to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to constrict, and it stimulates aldosterone production. Overall, this raises blood pressure and keeps sodium and potassium at normal levels.
A variety of conditions can lead to aldosterone overproduction (hyperaldosteronism, usually just called aldosteronism) or underproduction (hypoaldosteronism). Since renin and aldosterone are so closely related, both substances are often tested together to identify the cause of an abnormal aldosterone.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is drawn by needle from a vein in the arm to measure blood aldosterone and/or renin. Some healthcare practitioners prefer 24-hour urine collection for aldosterone since blood aldosterone levels vary throughout the day and are affected by position. In some cases, blood is collected from the renal (for renin) or adrenal (for aldosterone) veins by insertion of a catheter; this is done in the hospital at major medical centers by a specially trained radiologist.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For a blood aldosterone and renin measurement, the healthcare practitioner may ask you to be upright or lying down for a period of time (e.g., 15-30 minutes) prior to sample collection. You may also be instructed to avoid certain beverages, foods, or medications before the test. Follow any instructions you are given.

A blood aldosterone test and a renin test are usually ordered together when someone has high blood pressure, especially if the person also has low potassium. Even if potassium is normal, testing may be done if typical medications do not control the high blood pressure or if hypertension develops at an early age. Primary aldosteronism is a potentially curable form of hypertension, so it is important to detect and treat it properly.
Aldosterone levels are occasionally ordered, along with other tests, when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease. One of those tests, the aldosterone stimulation test, also called ACTH stimulation, tests aldosterone and cortisol to determine if someone has Addison disease, low pituitary function, or a pituitary tumor. A normal result is a cortisol increase and an increase in aldosterone after stimulation by ACTH.

Primary aldosteronism (Conn syndrome) is caused by the overproduction of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, usually by a benign tumor of one of the glands. The high aldosterone level increases reabsorption of sodium (salt) and loss of potassium by the kidneys, often resulting in an electrolyte imbalance. Signs and symptoms include high blood pressure, headache, and muscle weakness, especially if potassium levels are very low.
Lower than normal blood potassium (hypokalemia) in someone with hypertension suggests the need to look for aldosteronism. Sometimes, to determine whether only one or both adrenal glands are affected, blood may be taken from both of the adrenal veins and testing is done to determine whether there is a difference in the amount of aldosterone (and sometimes cortisol) produced by each of the adrenal glands.
Secondary aldosteronism, which is more common than primary aldosteronism, is caused by anything that leads to excess aldosterone, other than a disorder of the adrenal glands. It could be caused by any condition that decreases blood flow to the kidneys, decreases blood pressure, or lowers sodium levels. Secondary aldosteronism may be seen with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney disease, and toxemia of pregnancy (pre-eclampsia). It is also common in dehydration. In these conditions, the cause of aldosteronism is usually obvious.
The most important cause of secondary aldosteronism is narrowing of the blood vessels that supply the kidney, termed renal artery stenosis. This causes high blood pressure due to high renin and aldosterone and may be cured by surgery or angioplasty. Sometimes, to see if only one kidney is affected, a catheter is inserted through the groin and blood is collected directly from the veins draining the kidney (renal vein renin levels). If the value is significantly higher in one side, this indicates where the narrowing of the artery is present.
Low aldosterone (hypoaldosteronism) usually occurs as part of adrenal insufficiency. It causes dehydration, low blood pressure, a low blood sodium level, and a high potassium level. When infants lack an enzyme needed to make cortisol, a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia, this can decrease production of aldosterone in some cases.



","



The amount of salt in your diet and medications, such as over-the-counter pain relievers of the non-steroid class, diuretics, beta blockers, steroids, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and oral contraceptives can affect the test results. Some of these drugs are used to treat high blood pressure. Stress, exercise, and pregnancy can also affect the test results. Your healthcare provider will tell you if you should change the amount of sodium (salt) you ingest in your diet, your use of diuretics or other medications, or your exercise routine before aldosterone testing.
Licorice may mimic aldosterone properties and should be avoided for at least two weeks before the test because it can decrease aldosterone results. This refers only to the actual products of the licorice plant (hard licorice); most soft licorice and other forms of licorice sold in North America do not actually contain licorice. Check the package label if you are uncertain, or bring a package with you to ask the healthcare practitioner.
Aldosterone levels become very low with severe illness, so testing should not be done at times when someone is very ill. 



",,"



Aldosterone and renin tests are used to evaluate whether the adrenal glands are producing appropriate amounts of aldosterone and to distinguish between the potential causes of excess or deficiency. Aldosterone may be measured in the blood or in a 24-hour urine sample, which measures the amount of aldosterone removed in the urine in a day. Renin is always measured in blood.
These tests are most useful in testing for primary aldosteronism, also known as Conn syndrome, which causes high blood pressure. If the test is positive, aldosterone production may be further evaluated with stimulation and suppression testing.
Both aldosterone and renin levels are highest in the morning and vary throughout the day. They are affected by the body's position, by stress, and by a variety of prescribed medications.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in several tissues throughout the body. The ALP in blood samples of healthy adults comes mainly from the liver, with most of the rest coming from bones (skeleton). Elevated levels of ALP in the blood are most commonly caused by liver disease, bile duct obstruction, gallbladder disease, or bone disorders. This test measures the level of ALP in the blood.
In the liver, ALP is found on the edges of cells that join to form bile ducts, tiny tubes that drain bile from the liver to the bowels, where it is needed to help digest fat in the diet. ALP in bone is produced by special cells called osteoblasts that are involved in the formation of bone. Each of the various tissue types produces distinct forms of ALP called isoenzymes.
ALP blood levels can be greatly increased, for example, in cases where one or more bile ducts are blocked. This can occur as a result of inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or gallstones. Smaller increases of blood ALP are seen in liver cancer and cirrhosis, with use of drugs toxic to the liver, and in hepatitis.
Any condition causing excessive bone formation, including bone disorders such as Paget's disease, can cause increased ALP levels. Children and adolescents typically have higher blood ALP levels because their bones are still growing. As a result, the ALP test must be interpreted with different reference (normal) values for children and for adults.
It is possible to distinguish between the different forms (isoenzymes) of ALP produced by different types of tissues in the body. If it is not apparent from clinical signs and symptoms whether the source of a high ALP test result is from liver or bone disease, then a test may be performed to determine which isoenzyme is increased in the blood.

As part of a routine liver panel; when you have symptoms of a liver or bone disorder or when you have symptoms suggesting gallstones and gallbladder disease


","



An ALP test may be ordered as part of routine laboratory testing, often with a group of other tests called a liver panel. It is also usually ordered along with several other tests when you have symptoms of a liver or bone disorder.
Signs and symptoms of liver damage or disease may include:

Weakness, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Abdominal swelling and/or pain
Jaundice
Dark urine, light-colored stool
Itching (pruritus)

Some examples of the signs and symptoms suggesting a bone disorder include:

Bone and/or joint pain
Increased frequency of fractures
Deformed bones

An ALP test may be ordered when you have symptoms of a bile duct obstruction (e.g., gallstone), such as:

Severe abdominal pain, especially at the top right side or center of the abdomen
Pain that spreads to the back or right shoulder blade
Nausea that occurs at the same time as abdominal pain
Abdominal pain that is linked to eating a fatty meal (when the gallbladder contracts)
Normally, the intense pain lasts at least 30 minutes but begins to subside within an hour. An attack of biliary colic usually last less than 6 hours.




","



Results of the ALP test are typically interpreted along with gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) results and with other tests that may have been performed at the same time, such as a liver panel, as well as in the context of your medical history and physical exam.
High ALP usually means that either the liver has been damaged or a condition causing increased bone cell activity is present.

If other liver tests such as bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are also high, usually the increased ALP is caused by liver damage or disease. If GGT is also increased, then the high ALP is likely due to liver disease. Significantly elevated ALP, often more than 4 times what is normal, may indicate bile duct obstruction and/or gallbladder inflammation.
If liver tests and GGT are normal, then the high ALP is likely caused by bone diseases. Likewise, if calcium and/or phosphorus measurements are abnormal, usually the ALP is coming from bone.

If it is not clear from signs and symptoms or from other routine tests whether the high ALP is from liver or bone, then a test for ALP isoenzymes may be necessary to distinguish between bone and liver ALP.
ALP in liver disease
ALP results are usually evaluated along with other tests for liver disease. In some forms of liver disease, such as hepatitis, ALP is usually much less elevated than AST and ALT. When the bile ducts are blocked (usually by gallstones, scars from previous gallstones or surgery, or by cancers), ALP and bilirubin may be increased much more than AST or ALT. ALP may also be increased in liver cancer.
ALP in bone disease
In some bone diseases, such as Paget disease, where bones become enlarged and deformed, or in certain cancers that spread to bone, ALP may be increased.
If you are being successfully treated for Paget disease, then ALP levels will decrease or return to normal over time. If you have bone or liver cancer that responds to treatment, ALP levels should decrease.
Moderately elevated ALP may result from other conditions, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, congestive heart failure, ulcerative colitis, and certain bacterial infections.
Low levels of ALP may be seen temporarily after blood transfusions or heart bypass surgery. A deficiency in zinc may cause decreased levels. Persistent low levels of ALP could indicate hypophosphatasia, a rare genetic disorder of bone metabolism. Malnutrition may lower serum ALP activity.

Pregnancy can increase ALP levels. Temporary elevations are also seen with healing fractures.
Children and adolescents normally have higher ALP levels than adults because their bones are growing, and ALP is often very high during a growth spurt, which occurs at different ages in boys and girls.
Some drugs may affect ALP levels. For example, oral contraceptives may decrease levels while anti-epileptics may increase levels.



","



The alkaline phosphatase test (ALP) is used to help detect liver disease or bone disorders. It is often ordered along with other tests, such as a gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test and/or as part of a liver panel.

In conditions affecting the liver, damaged liver cells release increased amounts of ALP into the blood. This test is often used to detect blocked bile ducts because ALP is especially high in the edges of cells that join to form bile ducts. If one or more of them are obstructed, for example by gallstones or by a tumor, then blood levels of ALP will often be high.
Any condition that affects bone growth or causes increased activity of bone cells can affect ALP levels in the blood. An ALP test may be used, for example, to detect cancers that have spread to the bones or to help diagnose Paget disease, a condition that causes malformed bones. This test may also sometimes be used to monitor treatment of Paget disease or other bone conditions, such as vitamin D deficiency.

If ALP results are increased but it is not clear whether this is due to liver or bone disease, tests for ALP isoenzyme may be done to determine the cause.

","

To detect an ALK gene rearrangement in tumor tissue in order to guide non-small cell lung cancer therapy


","

A tumor tissue sample is obtained through a biopsy procedure or sometimes collected during surgery. The tumor tissue is typically evaluated by a pathologist prior to testing.


","



ALK is a short name for the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase gene. This test detects specific rearrangements in the ALK gene in cancer cells and tissue. The presence of these changes makes it more likely that a person with non-small cell lung cancer will respond to a targeted drug therapy.
The ALK gene codes for a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase. It is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases that regulate cell growth.
About 4-5% of people who have non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer, have an alteration on chromosome 2 that leads to the fusion of the ALK gene with another gene (fusion partner). The most common ALK fusion partner is a gene called EML4 and results in the production of an EML4-ALK fusion protein. It is a rare mutation most commonly seen in people who have never smoked or are light smokers, especially women of Asian descent.
There are several different methods of testing for ALK mutations, but all of them involve evaluating either the ALK gene rearrangement or the altered ALK protein in tumor tissue.

When you have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer and your healthcare practitioner is considering a therapeutic management plan that may include an ALK kinase inhibitor such as crizotinib


","



An ALK mutation test is usually ordered after an individual has been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma.



","



If the cancer tissue contains a specific ALK gene rearrangement mutation or altered ALK protein, then the affected person is likely to benefit from an ALK kinase inhibitor drug therapy such as crizotinib.
A person whose cancer does not have an ALK gene rearrangement is not likely to benefit from ALK kinase inhibitor drug therapy.
A person could have a negative test result if the tumor tissue sample is insufficient and/or when the cancer is heterogeneous (some cells contain the mutation and others do not). Additionally, there may be rare ALK mutations that are not detected by routine testing that looks for only the most common mutations.



","



ALK gene rearrangements are most often seen in light smokers or non-smokers with adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancers, especially women of Asian descent. Although this is a relatively rare mutation, the total number of people affected by lung cancer each year means that the test and potential drug therapy is applicable to thousands of people.



",,"



ALK mutation analysis is used primarily to determine if a person with adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer is likely to respond to an ALK kinase inhibitor drug therapy, such as crizotinib. This testing detects the presence of ALK gene rearrangements in tumor tissue.
The test is typically ordered along with or as a follow-up test to EGFR and ROS1. If a non-small cell lung cancer has an EGFR mutation, then the affected person is likely to respond to an anti-EGFR drug therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and further testing is usually not necessary. However, if the tumor is negative for an EGFR mutation, then the person is not likely to respond to an anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. ALK mutation testing is then used to determine whether the person's tumor would be likely to respond to an ALK kinase inhibitor.
If a person's tumor is negative for the most common ALK gene rearrangements, tests for other less common mutations not detected by the current test or tests for the altered ALK protein may be used to help predict therapeutic responses. In some cases, testing for the altered ALK protein may be preferred over ALK gene rearrangement testing.
Methods of testing include:

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)—this method looks at the genetic level for presence of the gene rearrangement; it is currently the gold standard for evaluating ALK fusions.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)—this method detects the altered ALK protein; IHC is an acceptable alternative to FISH.
Next generation sequencing (NGS) —this method detects ALK fusions and identifies the fusion partner gene, which may have some clinical significance.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—this method detects known ALK fusions; however, it cannot identify novel fusions.

To help diagnose allergies; sometimes to monitor the effectiveness of immunotherapy (desensitization) treatment


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is a class of antibody (immune protein) associated with allergic reactions. It is normally found in very small amounts in the blood. This test measures the amount of allergen-specific IgE in the blood in order to detect an allergy to a particular substance.
IgE is an antibody that functions as part of the body's immune system, its defense against ""intruders."" When someone with a predisposition to allergies is exposed to a potential allergen such as food, grass, or animal dander for the first time, that person becomes sensitized. The person's body perceives the potential allergen as a foreign substance and produces a specific IgE antibody that binds to specialized mast cells in the skin, respiratory system, and gastrointestinal tract, as well as to basophils (a type of white blood cell) in the bloodstream. With the next exposure, these attached IgE antibodies recognize the allergen and cause the mast and basophil cells to release histamine and other chemicals, resulting in an allergic reaction that begins at the exposure site.
A total IgE test measures the overall number of IgE antibodies in the blood, while a specific IgE test measures for a response to individual allergens. Each allergen-specific IgE antibody test performed is separate and very specific; for example, it will test honeybee versus bumblebee, egg white versus egg yolk, and giant ragweed versus western ragweed. Groupings of these tests, such as food panels or regional weed, grass, and mold panels, can be done. Alternatively, the healthcare practitioner may pick and choose selectively from a long list of individual allergens suspected of causing a person's allergies.
While the traditional method for blood testing was the RAST (radioallergosorbent test), it has been largely replaced with newer IgE-specific immunoassay methods. Some healthcare practitioners continue to refer to all IgE allergy blood tests as RAST even though it is not the exact assay that the testing laboratory uses.

When you have symptoms such as hives, dermatitis, nasal congestion, red itchy eyes, asthma, or abdominal pain that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be caused by an allergy


","



One or more allergen-specific IgE antibody tests may be ordered when a person has signs or symptoms that suggest an allergy to one or more substances. Signs and symptoms may include:

Hives
Dermatitis
Eczema
Red itchy eyes
Coughing, nasal congestion, sneezing
Asthma
Itching and tingling in the mouth
Throat tightness
Trouble breathing
Abdominal pain or vomiting and diarrhea

A test may also be ordered occasionally to help evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy or to determine whether a child has outgrown an allergy.



","



An elevated allergen-specific IgE result indicates that the person tested likely has an allergy. However, the amount of specific IgE present does not necessarily predict the potential severity of a reaction. A person's clinical history and additional medically-supervised allergy tests may be necessary to confirm an allergy diagnosis.
Negative results indicate that a person probably does not have a ""true allergy,"" an IgE-mediated response to the specific allergens tested.
Results of allergy blood testing must be interpreted with care. False negatives and false positives can occur. Even if an IgE test is negative, there is still a small chance that a person does have an allergy. Similarly, if the specific IgE test is positive, a person may or may not ever have an actual physical allergic reaction when exposed to that substance.



","



Sometimes, a healthcare practitioner will look at other blood tests for an indirect indication of an ongoing allergic process, including a total IgE level or a complete blood count (CBC) and white blood cell differential (specifically eosinophils and basophils). Increases in these test results may suggest an allergy, but they may also be elevated for other reasons.



",,"



The allergen-specific IgE antibody test is a blood test used to help diagnose an allergy to a specific substance or substances for a person who presents with acute or chronic allergy-like symptoms. This is especially true if symptoms are recurrent and appear to be tied to triggers, such as exposures to particular foods or environments, and if other family members are known to have allergies.
Other types of allergy tests may be performed by exposing a person to different substances under careful medical supervision. The usefulness of these tests, however, can be affected by skin conditions, such as significant dermatitis or eczema, and by medications, such as antihistamines and some antidepressants. With some tests there is also the potential for severe reactions, including, for example, anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening. In these cases, the allergen-specific IgE antibody test may be ordered as an alternative, as it is performed on a blood sample.
The allergen-specific IgE antibody test may also be performed to monitor immunotherapy (desensitization) or to see if a child has outgrown an allergy. Typically, the healthcare practitioner will interpret the results of the test in comparison with a person's symptoms and any other allergy tests being performed.

","

To help diagnose the cause of early onset emphysema and/or liver dysfunction; to establish the risk of emphysema and/or liver disease due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and determine the likelihood that children might inherit the risk


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a protein in the blood that protects the lungs from damage caused by activated enzymes. Laboratory tests measure the level of AAT in blood or identify abnormal forms of AAT that a person has inherited to help diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
AAT helps to inactivate several enzymes, the most important of which is elastase. Elastase is an enzyme produced by white blood cells called neutrophils and is part of the body's normal response to injury and inflammation. Elastase breaks down proteins so that they can be removed and recycled by the body. If its action is not regulated by AAT, elastase will also begin to break down and damage lung tissue.
Each individual inherits two copies of the gene that codes for AAT. It is called the protease inhibitor (SERPINA1) gene. This gene is co-dominant, which means that each SERPINA1 gene copy is responsible for producing half of the body's AAT. If there is a change or mutation in one or both of the gene copies, then less AAT and/or AAT with reduced function is produced.  
When AAT production drops below 30% of normal, the affected person will experience a disorder called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. People with this disorder are at a considerable risk of developing emphysema, a progressive lung disease, in early adulthood. If they smoke or are exposed to occupational dust or fumes, the lung damage tends to occur sooner and be more severe.
Certain types of dysfunctional AAT accumulate in the liver cells, where it is produced. As AAT builds up in these cells, it forms abnormal protein chains and begins to destroy the cells and damage the liver. About 10% of newborns with AAT deficiency have liver damage and are jaundiced. In severe cases, these infants may require a liver transplant to survive. AAT deficiency is currently the most common genetic cause of liver disease in the pediatric population.
In adults with AAT deficiency, the risk of developing chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is increased. Few adults with AAT deficiency actually have signs or symptoms of liver disease, however. The amount and function of the AAT depends on the gene mutation that is inherited. While there are more than 120 different alleles in the SERPINA1 gene, only a few are common. Most people in the U.S., about 90%, have two copies of the normal ""wild type"" M gene (MM). The most common abnormal genes are labeled S and Z.

When your infant or young child show signs of liver disease; when you develop emphysema before age 40; when you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or unexplained liver disease at any age; when you have a close relative with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency


","



Alpha-1 antitrypsin testing may be ordered when:

An infant has jaundice that lasts for more than a week or two, an enlarged spleen, fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites), persistent itching (pruritus), and other signs of liver injury
Someone of any age has COPD, raised, tender skin spots that form ulcers (necrotizing panniculitis), a vascular disease called granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or unexplained airway widening (bronchiectasis)
A person younger than 40 years of age develops wheezing, a chronic cough or bronchitis, is short of breath after exertion, and/or shows other signs of emphysema; this is especially true when the person is not a smoker, has not been exposed to known lung irritants, and when the lung damage appears to be located low in the lungs.
Someone has a close relative with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
An individual has an affected family member and wants to know the likelihood of having an affected child


In their 2003 guidelines, the American Thoracic Society recommends AAT testing when individuals are diagnosed with certain conditions such as:

Emphysema at a young age (younger than 45 years old) and/or no obvious risk factors for the disease, such as smoking
Bronchiectasis
Asthma that is difficult to treat
Liver disease with no known cause
Necrotizing panniculitis


In their 2016 guidelines, intended to update the American Thoracic Society's guidelines, the Alpha-1 Foundation recommends AAT testing for all individuals with:

COPD
Liver disease with no known cause
Necrotizing panniculitis
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Unexplained bronchiectasis


The Alpha-1 Foundation also recommends offering AAT testing and genetic counseling to individuals with close or extended family carrying an abnormal AAT gene.



","



AAT level
A low level of AAT in blood indicates that the person tested may have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The lower the level of AAT, the greater the risk of developing emphysema and other disorders related to AAT deficiency.
Phenotype test
In people with an abnormal form of AAT, the risk of developing disease depends on how much is produced and which variant is present. A variant with very low activity may lead to both emphysema (because it does not protect the lungs) and liver disease (because of the buildup of abnormal AAT inside liver cells).
Genotype test
Most people in the U.S. have two copies of the normal wild type (MM) gene and produce sufficient AAT.
When DNA testing indicates the presence of one or two abnormal copies of the SERPINA1 gene, less AAT and/or abnormal AAT will be produced. The degree of AAT deficiency and the degree of lung and/or liver damage can vary greatly. Two people with the same abnormal genes may have very different disease courses. As with any genetic testing, a genetic counselor can explain the likelihood that the disease may be passed on to the affected person's children.
People with one copy of M and one of S or Z (MS or MZ) will produce reduced amounts of AAT but should have enough to protect themselves. They will be carriers of the condition, however, and can pass it on to their children.
Individuals with two copies of S (SS) may be asymptomatic or moderately affected (they produce about 60% of normal AAT).
People with one copy of S and one of Z (SZ) are at an increased risk of developing emphysema (they produce about 40% of normal AAT).
Individuals who have two copies of Z (ZZ) are the most severely affected (they only produce about 10% of the required AAT) along with those who have one or two copies of rare forms of the SERPINA1 gene that are ""null"" (they do not produce any AAT).



","



AAT is an acute phase reactant. This means that it will be elevated in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, infections, and with some cancers. Increased levels of AAT may also be seen with oral contraceptive use, pregnancy, and stress. These temporary or chronic AAT increases may cause levels to appear normal in people with mild to moderate AAT deficiency.
AAT levels may be decreased in neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and in conditions that cause a decrease in serum proteins, such as kidney disease, malnutrition, and some cancers.
Protein electrophoresis is a test that evaluates many different proteins in the blood. Sometimes the test will detect a deficiency in AAT unexpectedly, when it is done for a different purpose. In those cases, follow-up testing for AAT may confirm a deficiency of the protein, even if there are no signs or symptoms of disease.



",,"



Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) testing is used to help diagnose alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the cause of early onset emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when a person does not have obvious risk factors such as smoking or exposure to lung irritants such as dust and fumes. It may also be used when someone has asthma that obstructs his or her breathing, even after treatment.
Testing is also used to help diagnose the cause of persistent jaundice and other signs of unexplained liver injury. This is done primarily in infants and young children but may be done in people of any age.
Testing may also be used to help determine whether a person who has a family history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency has one or two copies of the SERPINA1 gene.
Three types of AAT tests are commonly available. One or more of these may be used to evaluate an individual:

Alpha-1 antitrypsin measures the level of the protein AAT in blood.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin phenotype testing evaluates the amount and type of AAT being produced and compares it to normal patterns.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin genotype testing (DNA testing) can be used to establish which SERPINA1 gene alleles are present, including the normal wild type M allele or variant alleles. This test does not identify every variant, but it will detect the most common ones (S and Z) as well as variants that may be common in a particular geographical area or family. Once the affected person's SERPINA1 gene alleles have been identified, other family members may be tested to establish their own risk of developing emphysema and/or liver involvement as well as the likelihood that their children might inherit the disease.


Gene sequencing is uncommon for AAT but may be necessary to identify rare alleles and obtain an accurate diagnosis.

To help diagnose and monitor therapy for certain cancers of the liver, testicles, or ovaries


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced primarily by the liver in a developing baby (fetus). AFP levels are normally elevated when a baby is born and then decline rapidly. Outside of pregnancy and birth, liver damage and certain cancers can increase AFP levels significantly. This test measures the level of AFP in your blood.
AFP is produced whenever liver cells are regenerating. With chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis, AFP may be chronically elevated. Very high concentrations of AFP may be produced by certain tumors. This characteristic makes the AFP test useful as a tumor marker. Increased amounts of AFP are found in many people with the most common type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma and in a rare type of liver cancer that most commonly occurs in infants called hepatoblastoma. They are also found in some people with cancers of the testicles or ovaries.
AFP exists in several different forms. The standard AFP test is for a total AFP, one that measures all of the AFP forms together. This is the primary AFP test used in the United States.
One of the AFP forms is called L3. The AFP-L3% test is a relatively new test that compares the amount of AFP-L3 to the total amount of AFP. An increase in the percentage of L3 is associated with increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in the near future and of having a poorer prognosis, as the L3-related cancers tend to be more aggressive.
Among people with low total AFP, AFP-L3 can be higher in those with hepatocellular carcinoma than in people with benign liver diseases. Tumor markers including total AFP and AFP-L3 are used in addition to ultrasound for surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma in Japan. This practice is different from that in the U.S. and Europe, but the two tests are occasionally ordered by healthcare practitioners in the U.S.

When your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have certain cancers of the liver, testicles, or ovaries; at intervals during and after treatment for one of these cancers; sometimes when you have a condition that increases your risk of liver cancer, such as chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis

A healthcare practitioner may order an AFP blood test:

When it is suspected that you have liver cancer or certain cancers of the testicles or ovaries; cancer may be suspected when, for example, lumps are felt in the abdominal area during a physical exam or when imaging tests detect possible tumors.
When you have been diagnosed with and treated for a cancer of the liver, testicles, or ovaries and are being monitored for the effectiveness of treatment
When you are being monitored for cancer recurrence
To follow up when you have chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis

An AFP-L3% is sometimes ordered to help evaluate the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma when you have chronic liver disease or to test the effectiveness of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or monitor for its recurrence.



","



Increased AFP levels may indicate the presence of cancer, most commonly liver cancer, cancer of the ovary, or germ cell tumor of the testicles. However, not every liver, ovarian, or testicular cancer will produce significant quantities of AFP.
Elevated levels may sometimes be seen with other cancers such as stomach, colon, lung, breast, and lymphoma, although it is rarely ordered to evaluate these conditions. Other diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatitis can also cause increased levels.
When AFP is used as a monitoring tool, decreasing levels indicate a response to treatment. If AFP levels after cancer treatment do not significantly decrease, usually to normal or near normal levels, then some of the tumor tissue may still be present.
If your AFP levels begin to increase, then it is likely that the cancer is recurring. However, since AFP can be increased in hepatitis or cirrhosis, AFP levels can sometimes be misleading. If your AFP levels are not elevated prior to treatment, then the test will not generally be useful to monitor the effectiveness of your treatment or to monitor for recurrence.
When you have chronic liver disease and your AFP levels go from normal or moderately elevated to greatly elevated, your risk of developing liver cancer increases. When total AFP and AFP-L3% are significantly elevated, then you have an increased risk of having or developing hepatocellular carcinoma in the next year or two. However, both AFP and AFP-L3% concentrations can be elevated, and fluctuate, when you have chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In these cases, a sharp increase in AFP is more important than the actual numerical value of the test result.



","



Not every person with increased AFP and AFP-L3% test results has cancer or will develop liver cancer. The AFP and AFP-L3% tests are not diagnostic per se; they are indicators. They must be used in conjunction with information from your medical history and physical examination as well as histopathological examination and imaging studies to look for the development of tumors.
Although these tests can provide useful information, they are not as specific or sensitive as healthcare practitioners would wish. AFP can temporarily increase whenever the liver is injured and regenerating, and moderate elevations can be seen with a variety of conditions. Because of this, AFP testing cannot be used solely to diagnose cancer. In addition, not every cancer will produce AFP, so you could still have cancer even when the AFP is normal. For these reasons, the AFP test is not used to screen the general population for cancer.
AFP is not only a tumor marker. Because AFP is produced by the fetus, levels are normally higher in pregnant women and in their newborns. For more information on AFP testing during pregnancy, see the Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screen.



","



Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is used as a tumor marker to help detect and diagnose cancers of the liver, testicles, and ovaries. Though the test is often ordered to monitor people with chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, chronic  hepatitis B or hepatitis C because they have an increased lifetime risk of developing liver cancer, most current guidelines do not recommend this use. A healthcare practitioner may order an AFP test, along with imaging studies, to try to detect liver cancer when it is in its earliest and most treatable stages.
If you have been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma or another form of AFP-producing cancer, an AFP test may be used to help monitor your response to therapy and to monitor for cancer recurrence.
An AFP-L3% is sometimes also ordered to compare the amount of the AFP form called AFP-L3 to the total amount of AFP. The AFP-L3% test is not yet widely used in the U.S. but has gained wider acceptance in other countries such as Japan. The test is used to help evaluate the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially if you have chronic liver disease, and also to evaluate the response of your hepatocellular carcinoma to treatment.

No test preparation is needed, but the timing of the blood sample is important.

For interval dosing, trough levels are collected just prior to your next aminoglycoside dose. Peak levels are collected 30-45 minutes after the completion of an intravenous (IV) dose or 60 minutes after a dose injected into a muscle.
For extended-interval dosing, the recommended collection time may vary, but the time of the completion of the last dose and the time of the blood sample collection will be recorded and compared.

Follow your healthcare provider's directions for collection. It may be helpful to tell the laboratory professional drawing your blood the time your last dose was completed.

To monitor the level of an aminoglycoside antibiotic such as gentamicin, tobramycin, or amikacin in the blood to ensure adequate dosing and help avoid toxic side effects


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that are used to treat serious bacterial infections. The level of the prescribed aminoglycoside in the blood is measured in order to adjust doses as necessary and ensure effective treatment while avoiding toxic side effects. (For more information about this, see the article on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.)
Gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin are the most commonly prescribed aminoglycosides, and they are used to treat infections caused by certain types of Gram-negative bacteria as well as a few Gram-positive bacteria. (For more on these, see the article on the Gram stain).
It is important to monitor the concentration of aminoglycosides because their effectiveness depends on having an adequate level in the blood. Aminoglycosides are associated with serious toxic side effects, including damage to hearing and/or balance (ototoxicity) and acute kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). Though kidney damage caused by aminoglycosides is usually reversible, hearing and/or balance loss is frequently permanent. These side effects can occur at any time, but the risk is greater with elevated blood levels and when the drugs are given for an extended period of time. The risk of side effects is lower with some of the aminoglycosides that have been developed recently.
Aminoglycosides are not well absorbed by the digestive system, so they are typically be administered either through a needle into a vein (intravenously, IV) or by injection into a muscle (intramuscularly, IM). Aminoglycosides can be given:

Using dosing intervals (such as every 8-12 hours), or
As a large single dose once every 24 to 48 hours (also called extended-interval or pulse dosing).

The amount of an aminoglycoside given per dose depends on a variety of factors, including kidney function, other drugs you may be taking, your age and weight.
When a dose of aminoglycosides is given, the level typically rises in the blood to a peak concentration and then falls over time to a lower (trough) concentration. Sometimes these drugs are prescribed using interval dosing, in which the subsequent dose is timed to be given in anticipation of the falling level. The goal is to dose a sufficient amount of drug to maintain a therapeutic level that will kill the bacteria causing the infection. The dose and the dosing interval are optimized to give the body enough time to clear most of the drug from the previous dose before the next dose is given. This minimizes the risk of complications and helps ensure that an adequate drug level is always maintained in the blood.

For interval dosing, drug monitoring typically involves assessing the maximum concentration soon after a dose is given (called a peak level) and the minimum concentration just before the next dose is given (called a trough level). Depending on the measured concentration, the next dose of drug may be adjusted up or down. For example, you may not be able to clear the drug out of your system efficiently if you have kidney disease, resulting in an increased concentration in the blood, so the dose may be adjusted lower or the drug may be given less frequently. On the other hand, if you are given too little drug and have an insufficient level in the blood, it is unlikely that treatment will be effective.
For extended-interval dosing, testing may be performed similarly to interval dosing, using a peak sample and a sample taken 6-12 hours later, or testing can be performed on a single sample taken 6-14 hours after the first dose of antibiotic.

Aminoglycosides are sometimes prescribed alone but are often combined with other antibiotics. Monitoring the antibiotic blood level is especially important in the presence of other medications, as they can affect the ability of the body to process (metabolize) and clear the drug.

At regular intervals during treatment with an aminoglycoside


","



Blood levels of gentamicin, tobramycin or amikacin may be monitored under a variety of conditions. For example, your age, kidney function, overall health, and presence of underlying conditions or symptoms of toxicity may be considered in the decision to perform the testing. The length of treatment and type of protocol used for dosing can also be factors.
Monitoring of aminoglycosides may be recommended when you will be receiving the drug for more than 3 days.

For interval dosing, testing is usually ordered after 2 to 4 doses of the aminoglycoside have been given and when the drug is expected to have reached a relatively stable level in the blood (steady state). Drug levels then may be measured again every few days or once a week and with any change in the amount or timing of the dose or with change in kidney function.
With individuals receiving extended interval dosing, no steady state of the drug will be achieved. Typically, a timed random sample is drawn 6 to 14 hours after the dose for testing.

More frequent aminoglycoside monitoring may be performed for people with impaired kidney function (renal insufficiency) and for people who have an increased risk of toxic side effects, such as those taking other drugs known to adversely affect hearing and the kidneys (ototoxic or nephrotoxic).



","



For interval-dosing:

A trough level of the aminoglycoside below the target level indicates that you are clearing the drug at an adequate rate.
A peak level within the therapeutic range means there should be sufficient drug in the blood to be effective in treating your infection. The target level typically depends on the type of infection and the organ infected.
A peak level below the maximum level indicates that you are at less risk of developing toxic side effects, though you may still experience a complication.
If the trough and/or peak level is above the maximum level, then you are at an increased risk of toxicity and your healthcare provider may either alter the dose or alter the dosing schedule.

For an extended-dose regimen, the results can help your healthcare provider decide when to give the next dose. In general, if the blood level is at the low end of the range, the healthcare practitioner may decide to dose every 24 hours. If the level is at the higher end (indicating that the drug is being cleared more slowly), the healthcare practitioner may wait 48 hours before giving the next dose.
If your infection is not responding to the treatment, then your healthcare provider may either continue the drug for a longer period of time or consider other treatment options.



","



Intravenous doses of aminoglycosides are given slowly over about 30 minutes.
Other forms of aminoglycosides, such as eye drops, ear drops, and inhaled drugs, may be used to treat specific types of infections. Monitoring is not used in these cases.
The first aminoglycoside, streptomycin, was developed in the 1940s and used successfully to treat tuberculosis. Its use declined with the introduction of other aminoglycosides.
Aminoglycosides are cleared from the body by the kidneys, thus dosages are modified based upon kidney function. Tests that reflect the health of the kidneys, such as a creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), are often ordered prior to the initiation of aminoglycoside therapy and then at intervals to monitor kidney function.
Risk of toxicity is increased in people who are taking other drugs that affect hearing and the kidneys such as certain diuretics, particularly furosemide, or NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, or other antibiotics such as vancomycin.
Because of the potential for complications, extended-interval dosing is not recommended in people who:

Are elderly (older than about 70 years of age)
Are pregnant or have given birth recently
Have renal insufficiency or pre-existing kidney disease
Have serious liver disease
Have extensive burns
Have cystic fibrosis
Have a history of impaired hearing and/or loss of balance
Have myasthenia gravis

This test is used to monitor the level of the prescribed aminoglycoside antibiotic in the blood. Testing is used to ensure that the level of the drug in the blood is sufficient to treat the infection but not so high as to increase the risk of side effects.
In some cases, a dose of the drug is given only once every 24-48 hours (called extended-interval or pulse dosing). A test of the drug level on a sample taken 6-14 hours after the dose is used to ensure adequate dosing.
Blood drug levels are used by clinical pharmacists and healthcare providers to calculate the rate at which your body clears the drug from your blood. These results are then used to determine the appropriate amount of drug and the appropriate timing between doses to assure that the blood concentration is adequate for treating the infection but is not so high as to increase the risk of toxic side effects.

To detect an elevated level of ammonia in the blood that may be caused by severe liver disease, kidney failure, or certain rare genetic disorders; to help investigate the cause of changes in behavior and consciousness; to help diagnose hepatic encephalopathy or Reye syndrome


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Ammonia is a waste product formed primarily by bacteria in the intestines during the digestion of protein. If not processed and cleared from the body appropriately, excess ammonia can accumulate in the blood. This test measures the amount of ammonia in the blood.
Ammonia is normally transported in the blood to the liver, where it is converted into two substances called urea and glutamine. The urea is then carried to the kidneys, where it is eliminated in the urine. If this ""urea cycle"" does not complete the breakdown of ammonia, ammonia builds up in the blood and can pass from the blood into the brain.
Ammonia is toxic to the brain. For example, when liver function is significantly reduced due to disorders such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, ammonia and other compounds processed by the liver can accumulate in the brain and cause a condition called hepatic encephalopathy.
Hepatic encephalopathy causes mental and neurological changes that can lead to confusion, disorientation, sleepiness, and eventually to coma and even death.
Infants and children with increased ammonia levels may vomit frequently, be irritable, and be increasingly lethargic. Left untreated, they may experience seizures, have difficulty breathing, and may lapse into a coma.
Problems with ammonia processing can arise from conditions such as:

Severe liver disease – damage limits the ability of the liver to process ammonia; spikes in ammonia blood levels may be seen in people with stable liver disease, especially following a triggering event such as gastrointestinal bleeding or an electrolyte imbalance.
Decreased blood flow to the liver – ammonia is less able to get to the liver to be processed.
Reye syndrome – a rare condition that affects the blood, brain, and liver; it typically causes a rise in ammonia levels and a fall in glucose. It affects primarily children and young adults. In most cases, it follows and appears to be triggered by a viral infection, such as the flu or chickenpox. Children who are given aspirin are at an increased risk.
Kidney (renal) failure – the kidneys are unable to effectively rid the body of urea, leading to a build-up of ammonia in the blood.
Rare genetic disorder such as a defect in the urea cycle – a deficiency in one of the enzymes necessary to complete the conversion of ammonia to urea.

When someone with or without liver disease or kidney failure experiences mental changes or lapses into a coma; when a newborn experiences frequent vomiting and increased lethargy or when a child has continuous vomiting and unusual sleepiness during recovery from a viral illness, such as the flu or chickenpox


","



An ammonia test may be order when you experience signs and symptoms of an elevated ammonia level, such as:

Mental changes, disorientation
Sleepiness
Change in consciousness
Coma


The above symptoms can occur with and without liver disease or kidney failure. In you have stable liver disease, an ammonia level may be ordered, along with other liver function tests, when you suddenly become acutely ill.
An ammonia test may be ordered when a newborn has signs and symptoms that arise in the first few days after birth, such as:

Irritability
Vomiting
Lethargy
Seizures


An ammonia test may be performed when a child develops these same symptoms during recovery from a viral illness, such as influenza or chickenpox, to rule out Reye syndrome.



","



A significantly increased level of ammonia in the blood indicates that your body is not effectively processing and eliminating ammonia and it may be the cause of your signs and symptoms.
In children and adults, an elevated ammonia level may indicate that severe liver or kidney damage has affected the body's ability to clear ammonia and that the brain may be affected. Frequently, an acute or chronic illness will act as a trigger, increasing ammonia levels to the point that an affected person has difficulty clearing the ammonia.
In infants, high levels might indicate impairment of the urea cycle due to a rare genetic disorder such as a deficiency of one of the urea cycle enzymes, or may also be seen with hemolytic disease of the newborn. Moderate, temporary increases in ammonia are relatively common in newborns, where the level may rise and fall without causing noticeable symptoms. (For more about urea cycle disorders, see the links in the Related Content section below.)
An increased ammonia and low glucose in combination with elevated levels of certain liver enzymes may indicate the presence of Reye syndrome in symptomatic children and teens. An increased level may also indicate a previously undiagnosed enzymatic defect of the urea cycle.
A normal blood ammonia level may mean that your signs and symptoms are due to a cause other than excess ammonia. However, normal levels of ammonia do not rule out hepatic encephalopathy. Other breakdown products can contribute to changes in mental function and consciousness, and brain levels of ammonia may be much higher than blood levels. This can make correlation of symptoms to ammonia blood levels difficult.
A decreased level of ammonia may be seen with some types of hypertension, such as essential (high blood pressure of unknown cause) and malignant (very high blood pressure that occurs suddenly and quickly).



","



Increased levels of ammonia may also be seen with:

Gastrointestinal bleeding – blood cells are hemolyzed in the intestines, releasing protein.
Muscular exertion – muscles produce ammonia when active and absorb it when resting.
Tourniquet use – ammonia levels can be increased in the blood sample collected.
High protein intake – high protein diet might trigger ammonia accumulation in some patients.
Prematurity – in rare cases, very high ammonia levels can be seen in premature babies with respiratory distress.
Use of certain drugs, including alcohol, barbiturates, diuretics, high-dose chemotherapy, valproic acid, and narcotics
Cigarette smoking


Decreased levels of ammonia may be seen with the use of some antibiotics, such as neomycin and metronidazole.
Ammonia tests can also be performed on blood from an artery, but this is much less common than using blood from a vein. Some healthcare practitioners feel that arterial ammonia measurements are more clinically useful, but there is not widespread agreement on this.



","



The ammonia test is used to detect an elevated level in the blood. It may be ordered, along with other tests such as glucose, electrolytes, and kidney and liver function tests, to investigate the cause of changes in your behavior and consciousness or to help support the diagnosis of Reye syndrome or hepatic encephalopathy caused by various liver diseases.
Some healthcare practitioners use the ammonia test to monitor the effectiveness of treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, but there is not widespread agreement on this use. Since hepatic encephalopathy can be caused by the build-up of a variety of toxins in the blood and brain, blood ammonia levels correlate poorly with the severity of the condition.
An ammonia level may also be ordered to help diagnose certain rare genetic disorders. For example, it may be used to diagnose a urea cycle defect, to evaluate the severity of the urea cycle impairment in this condition, and also to monitor treatment.

amniotic-fluid-testing,"['Amniocentesis', 'Amnio', 'Culture - amniotic fluid', 'Culture - amniotic cells', 'Fetal Lung Maturity Tests']","

Depending upon the stage of pregnancy, either a full or empty bladder may be required at the time the amniocentesis is performed. Be sure to follow any instructions provided.


","

To detect and diagnose certain birth defects, genetic diseases, and chromosomal abnormalities in a fetus, especially if prenatal screening tests are abnormal; if there is a family history or high risk of inherited disease; sometimes to diagnose a fetal infection and occasionally to help diagnose and monitor hemolytic disease in a fetus; rarely, to evaluate fetal lung maturity when there is an increased risk of premature delivery


","

A sample (about 1 ounce) of amniotic fluid is obtained using a procedure called amniocentesis that involves inserting a thin needle through the belly and uterus into the amniotic sac (see Common Questions below).


","



Amniotic fluid surrounds, protects, and nourishes a growing fetus during pregnancy. Amniotic fluid analysis involves a variety of tests that can be performed to evaluate the health of a fetus.
Amniotic fluid allows a fetus to move relatively freely within the uterus, keeps the umbilical cord from being compressed, and helps maintain a stable temperature. Amniotic fluid is contained within the amniotic sac and is normally a clear to pale yellow liquid that contains proteins, nutrients, hormones, and antibodies.
Amniotic fluid begins forming one to two weeks after conception and increases in volume until there is about a quart at 36 weeks of pregnancy. The fluid is absorbed and continually renewed.
The fetus swallows and inhales amniotic fluid and releases it as urine. The amount of amniotic fluid increases over time and is constantly being absorbed and renewed. During this circulation process, cells from various parts of the fetus's body slough off into the fluid, and chemicals produced by the fetus are present as well. This is why samples of the fluid can be tested to evaluate fetal health. Several laboratory tests may be performed on the fluid to help identify various conditions and diseases (see ""How is the test used?"" below).
Recently, advances in testing technology and improved prenatal screening options, specifically non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS), has led to a decrease in the use of diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis. NIPS screens a blood sample from a pregnant woman for fragments of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) produced by the placenta. It typically screens for certain chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), and it can be performed as early as the 10th week of pregnancy. However, at this time, ""invasive"" diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are still needed to confirm the results of a positive prenatal screening test or to test for conditions not covered by the screening test.

","

Testing is most commonly offered between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to test for genetic diseases, chromosomal abnormalities, and open neural tube defects and is recommended after a pregnant woman has an abnormality on an initial prenatal screening test; when it is suspected that a fetus has an infection or other illness or when a fetus has hemolytic disease; rarely it may be done after 32 weeks to evaluate fetal lung maturity


","



Genetic amniotic fluid analysis may be offered as part of second trimester prenatal testing and is performed primarily between 15 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. In particular, testing is recommended when:

A woman has an abnormality on a first trimester Down syndrome screen, non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) using cell-free DNA, or second trimester maternal serum screen
A woman had a previous child or pregnancy with a chromosomal abnormality or genetic disorder
A parent has an inherited disorder or both parents have a known gene for an inherited disorder
An abnormality has been detected on a fetal ultrasound

Testing may be ordered to monitor bilirubin levels when there is a known Rh or blood type incompatibility between the fetus and mother and monitoring of the fetus indicates a blood transfusion may be needed.
An amniotic fluid analysis may be performed in late pregnancy to diagnose a fetal infection.
Fetal lung maturity amniotic fluid testing may be ordered woman is unsure of her dates and is at an increased risk for premature delivery or there is a sudden medical need for a preterm delivery.



","



Genetic tests, chromosome analysis and testing for neural tube defects
Because these results can be complex, women should discuss their test results not only with their healthcare practitioner but also ideally with someone who has expertise in genetics, such as a genetic counselor or maternal-fetal medicine specialist.
If a chromosomal abnormality or a genetic disorder is detected by diagnostic testing, then the baby likely will have the associated condition. However, many chromosomal disorders have a range of severity, and simply knowing a diagnosis does not help predict the condition's severity or prognosis. It should also be noted that not every genetic disorder or chromosomal abnormality will be detected with this testing.
If an increased alpha fetoprotein suggests an abnormality, such as an open neural tube defect or abdominal wall defect, then additional testing and imaging may be performed to determine the severity of the condition and the best course of action.
Rh or other blood type incompatibility
Increasing bilirubin levels in the amniotic fluid in the case of fetal-maternal blood type incompatibility indicate increasing destruction of red blood cells and the likelihood that the fetus will have hemolytic disease of the newborn, requiring treatment before or after birth, depending on the severity.
Fetal infections
Results of cultures of the amniotic fluid as well as tests for various viruses will indicate whether an infection is present.
Fetal lung maturity
Although rarely used these days, if testing indicates that the a fetus's lungs have not yet matured, then a healthcare practitioner may take measures to attempt delaying delivery, use medications to promote lung maturity, or when necessary to begin treating the baby immediately after birth.



","



Maternal or fetal blood contamination and stool from the fetus (meconium) in the amniotic fluid can affect some chemical test results.
An alternative to amniotic fluid analysis for chromosomal analysis and genetic testing is chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which can be performed earlier, between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. This first trimester procedure collects a small placenta tissue sample at the site of implantation and carries about the same risks as amniocentesis when performed by an experienced practitioner. CVS cannot, however, detect neural tube defects or abdominal wall defects, and occasionally may provide a chromosomal result that is representative of the placenta, but not the fetus (confined placental mosaicism).



","



Amniotic fluid analysis may be used for several different purposes and the specific testing that is done depends on the reason for testing. The following list includes some of the more common ways that this analysis may be used for prenatal diagnosis:
To detect chromosomal abnormalities or genetic disorders
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all pregnant women should be given the option of having amniocentesis performed to detect chromosome abnormalities. A healthcare practitioner can help a pregnant woman weigh the pros and cons.

Chromosome analysis—performed as either a cytogenetics test that can also be called karyotyping or as a chromosomal microarray analysis. Both methods detect chromosome abnormalities associated with a variety of chromosome disorders. The testing evaluates the 22 paired chromosomes and the sex chromosomes (X, Y) in cells from the sample of amniotic fluid and can be used to diagnose a variety of disorders, including:

	
Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), caused by an extra chromosome 21 in all or most cells of the body
Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), caused by an extra chromosome 18
Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13), caused by an extra chromosome 13
Klinefelter syndrome, the most common sex chromosome abnormality in males; caused by an extra X chromosome
Turner syndrome, caused by missing one X chromosome in females
		Due to the nature of this type of testing, chromosome analysis can also definitively determine the sex of a fetus.



Genetic testing, also called molecular testing, evaluates fetal DNA to look for specific gene mutations that are associated with specific genetic disorders. Molecular testing may be offered because of a family history of a specific inherited disorder or because of specific fetal ultrasound abnormalities that are known to have a genetic cause.

To detect open neural tube defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida or anencephaly, or open abdominal wall defects. For example:

AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) is elevated in amniotic fluid with neural tube defects.
Acetylcholinesterase is increased with neural tube defects and other anatomic abnormalities.

To detect Rh and other blood type incompatibilities
When a mother has been previously exposed through prior pregnancies or blood transfusions to ""foreign"" red blood cells (RBCs), she may develop antibodies to the proteins present on the outer layer of the foreign red cells (antigens). If the antigens are present on the red blood cells of the fetus (inherited from the father), then the mother's RBC antibodies can cross the placenta and bind to and destroy the fetus's red blood cells, causing hemolytic anemia. An affected fetus can develop hemolytic disease of the newborn. One of the most commonly encountered incompatibilities are due to ABO and Rh group differences, but there are many other blood types that may also cause this problem.
Typically, if a fetus has been tested and is known to have Rh or blood type incompatibility with the mother, the fetus is monitored non-invasively using imaging scans. However, if the fetus shows signs that a blood transfusion is needed, then tests for bilirubin (also known as delta OD450) may be performed to help evaluate the severity of the hemolytic anemia. This is an invasive test and is not performed routinely. Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment, a waste product primarily produced by the normal breakdown of heme. Heme is a component of hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells (RBCs).
To detect fetal infections
There are a few tests that can be performed on amniotic fluid to detect infections that are passed from mother to baby during pregnancy (congenital infections). Some of these infections may have serious consequences for the developing fetus. A few examples include tests for:

TORCH: toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV)
Parvovirus B19
Cultures for bacterial infections

To evaluate fetal lung maturity
Recent guidelines from ACOG no longer recommends routine use of fetal lung maturity in clinical decision-making. However, testing to evaluate fetal lung maturity may be performed in select situations, for example, if a woman is very unsure of her dates and is at an increased risk for premature delivery or there is a sudden medical need for a preterm delivery. Various substances are measured in amniotic fluid (lamellar body count, phosphatidylglycerol (PG), lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio). The goal of the testing is to determine the risk of a life-threatening condition called neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).

amylase,['Amy'],"

For both a blood test and a urine sample, you should avoid alcohol for 24 hours before the test and for the blood test, you may be instructed not eat or drink anything other than water for two hours before blood is drawn. Certain medications can affect amylase levels, so discuss medications with your doctor before testing is done.


","

Primarily to diagnose and monitor acute pancreatitis; also sometimes to diagnose and monitor chronic pancreatitis or other pancreatic diseases


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes a random urine sample, a 24-hour urine sample, or peritoneal fluid is collected.


","



Amylase is an enzyme produced primarily by the pancreas and the salivary glands to help digest carbohydrates. This test measures the amount of amylase in the blood or urine or sometimes in peritoneal fluid, which is fluid found between the membranes that cover the abdominal cavity and the outside of abdominal organs.
The pancreas is a narrow, flat organ about six inches long located deep within the abdominal cavity, below the liver and between the stomach and the spine. Its head section connects to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Inside the pancreas, small ducts (tubes) feed digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas into the pancreatic duct. The pancreas releases amylase through the pancreatic duct into the first part of the small intestine, where it helps break down dietary carbohydrates.
Amylase is usually present in the blood and urine in small quantities. When cells in the pancreas are injured, increased amounts of amylase are released into the blood. This also increases concentrations of amylase in the urine because amylase is eliminated from the blood through the urine. Increased amylase levels can occur with pancreatitis or when the pancreatic duct is blocked by a gallstone or, in rare cases, with a pancreatic tumor.

","

When you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, or nausea


","



A blood amylase test may be ordered when a person has signs or symptoms of a pancreatic disorder, such as:

Severe upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back or feels worse after eating
Fever
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice)
Rapid pulse
Loose, fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)

A urine amylase test may be ordered along with or following a blood amylase test. One or both may also be ordered periodically when a healthcare practitioner wants to monitor a person to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and to determine whether amylase levels are increasing or decreasing over time.



","



A high amylase level in the blood may indicate the presence of a condition affecting the pancreas.
In acute pancreatitis, amylase in the blood often increases to 4 to 6 times higher than the highest reference value, sometimes called the upper limit of normal. The increase occurs within 4 to 8 hours of injury to the pancreas and generally remains elevated until the cause is successfully treated. The amylase values will then return to normal in a few days.
Amylase and lipase results may be interpreted together. In acute pancreatitis, lipase levels usually rise in about the same time as blood amylase levels, about 3-6 hours, but lipase levels will remain elevated longer than amylase levels. Lipase testing is thought to be more reliable than amylase testing for the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and is also more sensitive to detecting acute pancreatitis caused by acute alcoholic pancreatitis.
In chronic pancreatitis, amylase levels initially will be moderately elevated but often decrease over time with progressive pancreas damage. In this case, levels returning to normal may not mean that the source of damage has been resolved. The magnitude of increase in amylase level does not indicate severity of pancreatic disease.
Amylase levels may also be significantly increased in people with pancreatic duct obstruction and pancreatic cancers.
In general, urine amylase levels rise in proportion to blood amylase levels and will stay elevated for several days after blood levels have returned to normal.
An increased level of amylase in peritoneal fluid can occur in acute pancreatitis but may also occur in other abdominal disorders, such as obstructed intestine or decreased blood flow to the intestines (infarct).
A low amylase level in blood and urine in a person with pancreatitis symptoms may indicate permanent damage to the amylase-producing cells in the pancreas. Decreased levels can also be due to kidney disease and pre-eclampsia.
Increased blood amylase levels with normal to low urine amylase levels may indicate the presence of a macroamylase, a benign complex of amylase and other proteins that accumulates in the blood.
Since the salivary glands also produce amylase, conditions such as mumps and obstructed salivary glands can also cause increased blood levels of amylase.



","



Chronic pancreatitis is often associated with alcoholism. It may also be caused by trauma or pancreatic duct obstruction or may be seen in association with genetic abnormalities such as cystic fibrosis.
In addition to the pancreas and salivary glands, amylase is produced in other parts of the body, such as the small intestine, ovaries, fallopian tubes and liver. However, most laboratory tests simply measure total amylase in the blood based on the fact that most of the amylase in blood, urine and fluids comes from the pancreas.



","



The blood amylase test is used to help diagnose and monitor acute pancreatitis. It may also be used to diagnose and monitor chronic pancreatitis and other disorders that may involve the pancreas.
The blood amylase test may be used along with a lipase test to detect pancreatic diseases. While the amylase test is sensitive for pancreatic diseases, it is not specific. That means an elevated amylase level may indicate a problem, but the cause may not be related to the pancreas. The lipase test, on the other hand, is more specific than amylase for diseases of the pancreas, particularly for acute pancreatitis and for acute alcoholic pancreatitis. An elevated lipase usually indicates a problem with the pancreas. Evaluating the results of the two tests together helps to diagnose or rule out pancreatitis and other conditions.
A urine amylase test may also be used to detect pancreatic diseases. Typically, its level will mirror blood amylase concentrations, but both the rise and fall will occur later. Sometimes a urine creatinine level may be ordered along with the urine amylase. The ratio of amylase to creatinine can be calculated and used to assess kidney function. Kidney dysfunction can result in a slower rate of amylase clearance.
In certain cases, for example when there is an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites), an amylase test may be performed on peritoneal fluid to help make a diagnosis of pancreatitis.
Amylase tests are sometimes used to monitor treatment of pancreatic cancer and after the removal of gallstones that have caused gallbladder attacks.

androstenedione,['AD'],"

In menstruating women, there may be specific instructions as to timing of the sample collection.


","

To help evaluate adrenal gland function; to detect adrenal tumors or cancers; to help determine the cause of male physical characteristics (virilization) in females or early puberty in boys; to evaluate androgen production and function of ovaries in women or testicular function in men; when congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is suspected; to monitor treatment for CAH


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Androstenedione is an androgen, one of several ""male"" sex hormones that are responsible for the onset of sexual differentiation in males and females and the development of secondary male physical characteristics such as a deep voice and facial hair. Though it is considered to be a ""male"" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women and is a precursor that can be converted by the body into more potent androgens, such as testosterone, or converted into the female hormone estrogen. This test measures the amount of androstenedione in the blood.
Androstenedione is produced by the ovaries in women, the testicles in men, and by the adrenal glands in both.

The pituitary hormone LH stimulates the release of androstenedione by the ovaries and testicles.
The pituitary hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the release of androstenedione by the adrenal glands.

The level of androstenedione in the blood will vary during the day in a ""diurnal pattern,"" and it will vary during a woman's menstrual cycle. Because of its origins, androstenedione can be useful as a marker of adrenal gland function, of androgen production, and of the function of the ovaries or testicles. An androstenedione test is often performed after results of other tests, such as testosterone or 17-hydroxyprogesterone, are found to be abnormal.
An excess level of androstenedione and other androgens can cause children to have sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous external genitalia), excess body hair (hirsutism), and abnormal menstrual periods in girls and precocious (early) puberty in girls and boys.
Adrenal tumors, ACTH-producing tumors, and adrenal hyperplasia can lead to the overproduction of androstenedione. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) may have higher levels of androstenedione as well. While elevated levels may not be noticed in adult men, they can lead to noticeable male physical characteristics (virilization) and a lack of monthly menstrual periods (amenorrhea) in females.

","

When a woman has excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), acne, no monthly menstrual periods (amenorrhea), fewer than 6-8 menstrual cycle per year (oligomenorrhea), or infertility; when a boy is undergoing very early (precocious) puberty or a girl is showing signs of virilization; when puberty is delayed; when diagnosing CAH; periodically when being treated for CAH


","



Androstenedione may be ordered, along with or following other hormone tests, whenever excess (or, more rarely, deficient) androgen production is suspected and/or when a doctor wants to evaluate a person's adrenal gland, ovarian, or testicular function.
It may be ordered when a female infant has external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous external genitalia) or when a young girl develops male physical features that may be due to CAH or another condition associated with excess androgens.
Androstenedione may be measured when young boys show signs of precocious puberty – the development of an enlarged penis, muscularity, pubic hair, and/or a deeper voice – well before the age of normal puberty. It may also be ordered when puberty is delayed.
It may be measured when a woman has infertility or symptoms that can vary in severity and may include:

A deeper voice
Acne
Excess facial and/or body hair
Lack of or irregular menstruation
Male pattern baldness
Muscularity

Androstenedione is ordered periodically to help monitor glucocorticoid replacement therapy for CAH.



","



A normal androstenedione level, along with other normal androgen levels and other normal adrenal tests, may indicate that the adrenal gland is functioning normally. However, an androstenedione level may be normal or elevated when an adrenal tumor or cancer is present, depending upon the hormones it is secreting. With polycystic ovarian syndrome, androstenedione may be elevated but may also be normal as this disorder is usually related to ovarian androgen production (primarily testosterone).
An elevated level of androstenedione indicates increased adrenal, ovarian or testicular production. Small fluctuations in concentration are usually normal. An increased level may indicate an adrenal tumor, adrenal cancer, adrenal hyperplasia, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). An increased level is not diagnostic of a specific condition; it usually indicates the need for further testing to pinpoint the cause.
A low level of androstenedione may be due to adrenal gland dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, or to ovarian or testicular failure.
In those with CAH who are being treated with glucocorticoid steroids, normal levels of androstenedione tend to indicate that treatment is effective in suppressing excess androgen production, while elevated levels indicate the need for treatment adjustment.



","



If a radioimmunoassay method is used to measure androstenedione, then a radioactive scan performed within one week prior to testing may invalidate test results.
Androstenedione concentrations increase in boys undergoing puberty, for about two years prior to significant increases in testosterone. Androstenedione levels are not usually used to monitor this process.
Adrenal androstenedione is the major source of androgens for postmenopausal women.



",,"



Androstenedione testing is used to evaluate the function of the adrenal gland and the ovaries or the testicles as well as the production of hormones related to the development of male sex organs and physical characteristics (androgens). It is most commonly used to determine the cause of symptoms of excess androgens in a woman who has an elevated testosterone level, along with a few other laboratory tests for this purpose.
An androstenedione level may be used to:

Evaluate adrenal gland function and to distinguish between androgen-secreting conditions that are caused by the adrenal glands from those that originate in the ovaries or testicles, if results of DHEAS and testosterone testing are abnormal
Help diagnose tumors in the outer layer (cortex) of the adrenal gland or tumors outside of the adrenal gland that secrete ACTH (ectopic) and separate these conditions from ovarian or testicular tumors and cancers
Diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and monitor CAH treatment, in addition to tests for testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, for example
Help diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and help rule out other causes of infertility, no monthly menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and excess body and facial hair (hirsutism) in women who have abnormal results on tests for DHEAS, testosterone, and other hormones such as FSH, LH, prolactin, and estrogen
Investigate and diagnose the cause of male physical characteristics (virilization) in young girls and early (precocious) puberty in young boys
Help determine the cause of delayed puberty and investigate suspected ovarian or testicular failure

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is an enzyme that helps regulate blood pressure. An increased blood level of ACE is sometimes found in sarcoidosis, a systemic disorder of unknown cause that often affects the lungs but may also affect many other body organs, including the eyes, skin, nerves, liver, and heart., This test measures the amount of ACE in the blood.
A classic feature of sarcoidosis is the development of granulomas, small tumor-like masses of immune and inflammatory cells and fibrous tissue that form nodules under the skin and in organs throughout the body. Granulomas change the structure of the tissues around them and, in sufficient numbers, they can cause damage and inflammation and may interfere with normal functions. The cells found at the outside borders of granulomas can produce increased amounts of ACE. The level of ACE in the blood may increase when sarcoidosis-related granulomas develop.

","

When you have granulomas that produce small bumps under the skin, a lingering cough, red watery eyes, and/or other symptoms suggestive of sarcoidosis; regularly when you have active sarcoidosis to monitor its course


","



An ACE test is ordered when someone has signs or symptoms that may be due to sarcoidosis, such as:

Granulomas
A chronic cough or shortness of breath
Red, watery eyes
Joint pain

This is especially true if the person is between 20 and 40 years of age, when sarcoidosis is most frequently seen.
When someone has been diagnosed with sarcoidosis and initial ACE levels were elevated, a health practitioner may order ACE testing at regular intervals to monitor the change in ACE over time as a reflection of disease activity.



","



An increased ACE level in a person who has clinical findings consistent with sarcoidosis means that it is likely that the person has an active case of sarcoidosis, if other diseases have been ruled out. ACE will be elevated in 50% to 80% of those with active sarcoidosis. The finding of a high ACE level helps to confirm the diagnosis.
A normal ACE level cannot be used to rule out sarcoidosis because sarcoidosis can be present without an elevated ACE level. Findings of normal ACE levels in sarcoidosis may occur if the disease is in an inactive state, may reflect early detection of sarcoidosis, or may be a case where the cells do not produce increased amounts of ACE. ACE levels are also less likely to be elevated in cases of chronic sarcoidosis.
When monitoring the course of the disease, an ACE level that is initially high and then decreases over time usually indicates spontaneous or therapy-induced remission and a favorable prognosis. A rising level of ACE, on the other hand, may indicate either an early disease process that is progressing or disease activity that is not responding to therapy.

ACE assists in the conversion of angiotensin I (an inactive protein) to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II functions as a strong vasopressor; it causes arteries to contract, making them temporarily narrower and increasing the pressure of the blood flowing through them. This conversion is a normal regulatory process in the body. The process has been targeted by the development of drugs called ACE inhibitors that are commonly used in treating hypertension and diabetes. These drugs inhibit the conversion process, keeping the blood vessels more dilated and the blood pressure lower. ACE inhibitors are useful in managing hypertension, but they are not monitored with ACE blood tests. They may, however, interfere with ACE measurements ordered for other reasons.
High and low levels of ACE may be seen in a variety of conditions other than sarcoidosis. The ACE test, however, is not routinely used to diagnose or monitor these conditions; it has not been shown to be clinically useful.
Decreased ACE levels may also be seen in people with:

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Lung diseases such as emphysema, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis
Starvation
Steroid drug therapy
Hypothyroidism

ACE has been found in moderately increased levels in a variety of diseases and disorders, such as:

HIV
Histoplasmosis (fungal respiratory infection)
Diabetes mellitus
Hyperthyroidism
Lymphoma
Alcoholic cirrhosis
Gaucher disease (a rare inherited lipid metabolism disorder)
Tuberculosis
Leprosy

The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) test is primarily ordered to help diagnose and monitor sarcoidosis. It is often ordered as part of an investigation into the cause of a group of troubling chronic symptoms that are possibly due to sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis is a disorder in which small nodules called granulomas may form under the skin and in organs throughout the body. The cells surrounding granulomas can produce increased amounts of ACE and the blood level of ACE may increase when sarcoidosis is present. (See the ""What is being tested?"" section for more on this.)
The blood level of ACE tends to rise and fall with disease activity. If ACE is initially elevated in someone with sarcoidosis, the ACE test can be used to monitor the course of the disease and the effectiveness of corticosteroid treatment.
A health practitioner may order ACE along with other tests, such as AFB tests that detect mycobacterial infections or fungal tests. This may help to differentiate between sarcoidosis and another condition causing granuloma formation.

","

To determine the likelihood that a particular antibiotic or antifungal drug will be effective in stopping the growth of the bacteria or fungi causing your infection


","

A sample from an infected site is cultured on specialized media to recover the bacteria or fungus that is causing the infection. The method used to collect a sample from an individual depends on the type of culture performed (e.g., urine culture, blood culture, sputum culture, etc.).


","



Susceptibility is a term used when microbe such as bacteria and fungi are unable to grow in the presence of one or more antimicrobial drugs. Susceptibility testing is performed on bacteria or fungi causing an individual's infection after they have been recovered in a culture of the specimen. Testing is used to determine the potential effectiveness of specific antibiotics on the bacteria and/or to determine if the bacteria have developed resistance to certain antibiotics. The results of this test can be used to help select the drug(s) that will likely be most effective in treating an infection.
Bacteria and fungi have the potential to develop resistance to antibiotics and antifungal drugs at any time. This means that antibiotics once used to kill or inhibit their growth may no longer be effective. (For more about cultures, see specific articles: Blood Culture, Urine Culture, Wound Culture, AFB Smear and Culture, Fungal Tests).
Although viruses are microbes, testing for their resistance to antiviral drugs is performed less frequently and by different test methods. This article is limited to the discussion of bacterial and fungal susceptibility testing.
During the culture process, pathogens are isolated (separated out from any other microbes present). Each pathogen, if present, is identified using biochemical, enzymatic, or molecular tests. Once the pathogens have been identified, it is possible to determine whether susceptibility testing is required. Susceptibility testing is not performed on every pathogen; there are some that respond to established standard treatments. For example, strep throat, an infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as group A streptococcus), can be treated with ampicillin and does not require a test to predict susceptibility to this class of antibiotics.
Susceptibility testing is performed on each type of bacteria or fungi that may be relevant to the individual's treatment and whose susceptibility to treatment may not be known. Each pathogen is tested individually to determine the ability of antimicrobials to inhibit its growth. This is can be measured directly by bringing the pathogen and the antibiotic together in a growing environment, such as nutrient media in a test tube or agar plate, to observe the effect of the antibiotic on the growth of the bacteria. Resistance can also be determined by detection of a gene that is known to cause resistance to specific antibiotics.

Susceptibility testing is usually ordered at the same time as a culture of a potentially infected site, such as a wound, urine, or blood culture. However, the test will usually only be performed when the culture is positive for one or more pathogens. The test may also be ordered when an infection does not respond to treatment to see if the pathogen has developed resistance and to determine which antimicrobial drug would be more effective in treating the infection.



","



Results of the testing are usually reported as:

Susceptible — likely, but not guaranteed to inhibit the pathogenic microbe; may be an appropriate choice for treatment
Intermediate — may be effective at a higher dosage, or more frequent dosage, or effective only in specific body sites where the antibiotic penetrates to provide adequate concentrations
Resistant — not effective at inhibiting the growth of the organism in a laboratory test; may not be an appropriate choice for treatment

These categories are based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). This is the lowest concentration of an antibiotic that will be effective in inhibiting growth of the bacteria. Though results may be expressed as the MIC, in units such as micrograms/milliliter, the laboratory will often include in the report an interpretation of what the results mean (e.g., susceptible, intermediate or resistant).
If there is more than one pathogen identified in a culture, the laboratory will contain the results for each one.
A healthcare practitioner will choose an appropriate drug from those on the report that were categorized as ""Susceptible."" If there are no ""Susceptible"" choices, or the patient is allergic to drugs in the susceptible category, then the practitioner may select one categorized as ""Intermediate."" This may require a higher dosage and may involve a longer duration of therapy as well as a higher risk for medication side effects.
A pathogen may be ""Resistant"" to all of the drugs that are usually used to treat that type of infection. If this is the case, then the practitioner may prescribe a combination of antibiotics that work together to inhibit the bacteria when neither one alone will be effective. These drug therapies may be more expensive and may have to be given intravenously, sometimes for extended periods of time. Some infections caused by resistant bacteria have proven very difficult to treat.



","



A sample for culture and susceptibility testing should be collected before the start of any treatment with an antimicrobial drug, unless the test is used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. 



",,"



Susceptibility testing is used to determine which antimicrobials will inhibit the growth of the bacteria or fungi causing a specific infection. The results from this test will help a healthcare practitioner determine which drugs are likely to be most effective in treating a person's infection.
Some types of infections may require testing because the bacteria or fungi isolated from an infection site are known to have unpredictable susceptibility to the drugs usually used to treat them. Some examples include staphylococci (""staph"") and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Sometimes there may be more than one type of pathogen isolated from an infected site, such as a wound infection. Susceptibility testing may be used to determine which antibiotic or antibiotic combinations will be most effective in treating all the different types of bacteria causing the infection.

To detect the presence of anticentromere antibodies; to help diagnose limited cutaneous scleroderma, a subtype of scleroderma


","

","



The anticentromere antibody (ACA) is an autoantibody, a protein produced by the immune system that mistakenly targets the body's own tissues. ACA is one of several antinuclear antibodies. It targets the centromere, a component of the chromosomes (structures in the nucleus) found in all nucleated cells in our bodies except red blood cells. The ACA test detects and measures the amount of anticentromere antibody found in blood to help diagnose a form of scleroderma.
Scleroderma (also known as systemic sclerosis) is a group of rare connective tissue disorders. (For more details, see the condition article on Scleroderma.) There are two distinct subtypes of systemic sclerosis that are defined based on how much of the skin is affected:

Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis that affects the entire body
Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis that is typically associated with one or more symptoms that are known collectively as CREST syndrome

CREST syndrome symptoms include:

Calcinosis – calcium deposits under the skin
Raynaud phenomenon – episodes of decreased blood flow to fingers and toes, causing them to turn white and blue
Esophageal dysfunction – difficulty swallowing, acid reflux, and heartburn
Sclerodactyly – tight, thick, shiny skin on the hands and fingers
Telangiectasia – red spots on skin due to swollen capillaries

Other signs that may be considered in scleroderma include fingertip lesions, abnormal capillaries in the skin just below the fingernails, high blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary arterial hypertension) and/or scarring of the lungs (interstitial lung disease).
ACA is found in about 60-80% of people who have limited cutaneous scleroderma while only about 5% of patients with diffuse scleroderma have ACA. ACA can be present in up to 95% of people who have CREST syndrome.

The ACA test may be ordered when you have a positive result on an ANA test and/or one or more of the symptoms associated with CREST. These symptoms include:

Calcinosis – calcium deposits under the skin
Raynaud phenomenon – episodes of decreased blood flow to fingers and toes, causing them to turn white and blue
Esophageal dysfunction – difficulty swallowing, acid reflux, and heartburn
Sclerodactyly – tight, thick, shiny skin on the hands and fingers
Telangiectasia – red spots on skin due to swollen capillaries

If a your ACA result is positive, indicating you have anti-centromere antibodies in your blood, and you have symptoms of CREST, then it is likely that you have limited cutaneous scleroderma. ACA is found in about 60-80% of people who have limited cutaneous scleroderma and can be present in up to 95% of those who have CREST syndrome. Around 5-7% of ACA positive patients develop diffuse cutaneous scleroderma.
If your ACA result is negative, then it is likely that your symptoms are due to another condition. However, it is possible, though rare, that you have limited cutaneous scleroderma and do not produce anticentromere antibodies, resulting in a negative ACA test.



","



ACA can be positive in some other autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or primary biliary cirrhosis.
Typically, only people who have CREST symptoms are tested for ACA. However, some people may be positive for ACA prior to the development of these symptoms and ACA may be performed in conjunction with testing for other autoimmune disorders such as ANA testing.
The amount of ACA present does not, in general, correlate to the severity of signs and symptoms.



","



The anticentromere antibody (ACA) test is primarily ordered to help diagnose the autoimmune disorder limited cutaneous scleroderma, a form of systemic scleroderma, and CREST syndrome. The test may be used to distinguish between this and other conditions with similar symptoms.
An ACA test may be ordered along with other tests for autoantibodies, including ANA (antinuclear antibody) testing. ACA testing may be used to provide your healthcare practitioner with additional information if an ANA test is positive, especially if the test produces a certain pattern characteristic of particular antibodies. (For more on this, see the ""What does the test result mean?"" section in the ANA article.)
An ACA test may be ordered along with a Scl-70 (anti-topoisomerase I) test. Scl-70 is another autoantibody that may be present with scleroderma. An anti-RNA polymerase III autoantibody (ARA) test may also be ordered in the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. These autoimmune antibody tests could be performed as part of an Extractable Nuclear Antigen (ENA) antibody panel, or other antibody panels for autoimmune disorders and/or systemic sclerosis.

To help detect, diagnose, and determine the cause of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency, resistance to its effects, or excess; to investigate low blood sodium levels (hyponatremia); to distinguish between the two types of diabetes insipidus


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also called arginine vasopressin (AVP), is a hormone that helps regulate water balance in the body by controlling the amount of water the kidneys reabsorb while they are filtering wastes out of the blood. This test measures the amount of ADH in the blood.
ADH is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain and stored in the posterior pituitary gland at the base of the brain. ADH is normally released by the pituitary in response to sensors that detect an increase in blood osmolality (number of dissolved particles in the blood) or decrease in blood volume. The kidneys respond to ADH by conserving water and producing urine that is more concentrated. The retained water dilutes the blood, lowers its osmolality, and increases blood volume and pressure. If this is not sufficient to restore the water balance, then thirst is also stimulated so that the affected person will drink more water.
There are a variety of disorders, conditions, and medications that can affect either the amount of ADH released or the kidneys' response to it. ADH deficiency and excess can cause symptoms and complications that, in rare cases, may become life-threatening.
If there is too little ADH or the kidneys do not respond to ADH, then too much water is lost through the kidneys, the urine produced is more dilute, and the blood becomes more concentrated. This can cause excessive thirst, frequent urination, dehydration, and – if you do not drink enough water to replace what is being lost – high blood sodium.
If there is too much ADH, then water is retained, blood volume increases, and the person may experience nausea, headaches, disorientation, lethargy, and low blood sodium.
The ADH test is not widely used to diagnose these conditions. Often, a diagnosis is made on the basis of medical history and other laboratory tests, such as urine and blood osmolality and electrolytes.
ADH deficiency, also called diabetes insipidus, is caused by a lack of ADH or the kidney's inability to respond to ADH.

Central diabetes insipidus is associated with a lack of ADH production by the hypothalamus or release from the pituitary and may be due to a variety of causes, including an inherited genetic defect, head trauma, a brain tumor, or due to an infection that causes encephalitis or meningitis.
Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus originates in the kidney and is associated with a lack of response to ADH, causing an inability to concentrate urine. It may be inherited or caused by a variety of kidney diseases.

Both types of diabetes insipidus lead to large volumes of dilute urine eliminated by the kidneys.
Excessive ADH is seen in ""syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone"" (SIADH) when ADH is released in unregulated quantities. SIADH is caused by inappropriate production of too much ADH, resulting in water retention, low blood sodium, and decreased blood osmolality.

The increased production is not due to the normal response to high blood osmolality or low blood volume.
SIADH may be due to a wide number of diseases and conditions that either stimulate excessive ADH production and release or that prevent its suppression.
SIADH may also be seen with cancers that produce ADH or ADH-like substances independent of the hypothalamus and pituitary glands.

Regardless of the cause or source, excess ADH causes low blood sodium and osmolality because water is retained and blood volume is increased.

When you have low blood sodium levels or persistent thirst, frequent urination, and dehydration


","



An ADH test may be ordered by itself, along with other tests, or as part of a water deprivation or water loading procedure when excess or deficient ADH is suspected. It may be ordered when a person has low blood sodium without an identifiable cause and/or has symptoms associated with SIADH. If SIADH develops gradually, there may be no symptoms, but if the condition is acute, the signs and symptoms are usually those associated with water intoxication and may include:

Headache
Nausea, vomiting
Confusion
In severe cases, coma and convulsions

An ADH test may be ordered when a person has excessive thirst and frequent urination and the health practitioner suspects diabetes insipidus.



","



ADH test results alone are not diagnostic of a specific condition. The results are usually evaluated in conjunction with a person's medical history, physical examination, and results of other tests. Low or high levels of ADH may be temporary or persistent, acute or chronic, and may be due to an underlying disease, an infection, an inherited condition, or due to brain surgery or trauma.
In distinguishing between the two types of diabetes insipidus:

A low ADH may be seen with central diabetes insipidus.
An increased ADH may be seen with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

A water deprivation ADH stimulation test is sometimes used to help distinguish between these types. (For more details, see below.)
An increased level of ADH is often seen with syndromes of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). Testing for SIADH may include blood and urine osmolality, sodium, potassium, and chloride tests, and sometimes an ADH measurement. A water loading ADH suppression test is sometimes performed. (For more details, see below.)
SIADH may be due to a variety of cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the lung, pancreas, bladder, and brain. Levels of ADH may be greatly increased with such cancers.
Other testing may be performed to help distinguish SIADH from other disorders that can cause fluid accumulation (edema), low blood sodium, and/or decreased urine production, such as congestive heart failure, liver disease, kidney disease, and thyroid disease.
Increased ADH may also be seen with dehydration, trauma, and surgery. Moderate increases in ADH may be seen with nervous system disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and acute intermittent porphyria, with pulmonary disorders such as cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and tuberculosis, and in those with HIV/AIDS. The ADH test may sometimes be ordered to help investigate low blood sodium and its associated symptoms, and to identify SIADH, but it is not generally ordered to diagnose or monitor any of the diseases or conditions that may cause it.
In addition to central diabetes insipidus, a low ADH may be seen with drinking large volumes of water, and with low serum osmolality.



","



In general, the ability to concentrate urine decreases with age.
ADH production temporarily increases when a person is standing, during the night, and with pain, stress and exercise. Production decreases with hypertension and when someone is lying down.

The antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test may be used to help detect, diagnose, and determine the cause of antidiuretic hormone deficiency or excess. However, this test is not widely used; diagnoses of these conditions are often based on clinical history and other laboratory tests, such as blood and urine osmolality as well as electrolytes.
ADH testing may be done to help diagnose diabetes insipidus and to distinguish between the two main types, central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, or testing may be done to help diagnose syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH).

Anti-DNase B (antideoxyribonuclease-B antibody) is one of the most common of several antibodies that are produced by the body's immune system in response to an infection with group A Streptococcus (strep infection). The anti-DNase B test measures the amount of this antibody in the blood. It is typically done with or following an antistreptolysin O (ASO) test, another test to detect antibody to a streptococcal antigen.
Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), is the bacterium that causes strep throat and a variety of other infections, including skin infections (pyoderma, impetigo, cellulitis). In most cases, strep infections are diagnosed and successfully treated with antibiotics.
Sometimes a strep infection does not cause identifiable symptoms, goes untreated, or is treated ineffectively, and complications (sequelae), namely rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis, can develop, especially in young children. These secondary conditions are uncommon in the U.S. because of routine strep testing and antibiotic treatment, but they do occur.

Rheumatic fever is a delayed immune response in which the body produces antibodies directed against itself (autoimmune). This can cause serious damage to heart valves and lead to symptoms such as swelling and pain in several joints, heart inflammation (carditis), skin nodules, rapid, jerky movements (Sydenham chorea), and skin rash.
Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a condition affecting the kidneys, can develop a week or two after a strep infection. Your body produces antibodies to fight the strep infection, but these antibodies can eventually be deposited in the glomeruli, which are small, looping blood vessels within the kidneys that continually filter the blood. This can cause inflammation and kidney damage, affecting kidney function.

","



The anti-DNase and ASO test are ordered when you have signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to complications caused by a recent strep infection, including rheumatic fever and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.
Some signs and symptoms of rheumatic fever may include:

Fever
Joint swelling and pain in more than one joint, especially in the ankles, knees, elbows and wrists, sometimes moving from one joint to another
Small, painless nodules under the skin
Rapid, jerky movements (Sydenham chorea)
Skin rash
Sometimes the heart can become inflamed (carditis); this may not produce any symptoms but also may lead to shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest pain


Some signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis may include:

Fatigue, decreased energy
Producing less urine
Bloody urine
Rash
Joint pain
Fluid accumulations and swelling (edema)
High blood pressure


However, these symptoms can be seen in other conditions.
Anti-DNase B testing may be performed twice, with samples collected about two weeks apart, for acute and convalescent titers. This is done to determine if the antibody level is rising, falling, or remaining the same.



","



Anti-DNase B and ASO test results may be interpreted together. Anti-DNase B and ASO antibodies are produced about a week to a month after a strep infection. The amount of anti-DNase B antibody (titer) peaks about 4 to 6 weeks after the illness and may remain elevated for several months. They typically remain elevated longer than ASO antibody titers.
Negative anti-DNase B and ASO tests or very low titers means that it is unlikely you had a recent strep infection. This is especially true if a sample taken 10 to 14 days later is also negative. Your signs and symptoms are likely due to a cause other than a recent strep infection.
A small percentage (10-15%) of those who have a complication related to a recent strep infection will not have an elevated ASO titer. This is especially true with glomerulonephritis that develops after a skin strep infection. These people may, however, have an elevated anti-DNase B titer and/or an elevation in another streptococcal antibody such as an elevated antihyaluronidase titer.
Elevated or rising antibody titers of anti-DNase or ASO means that it is likely you had a recent strep infection.
If your have signs and symptoms of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis, an elevated anti-DNase B and/or ASO titer can help confirm the diagnosis.



","



The anti-DNase B test may be ordered along with another streptococcal antibody test, such as an antihyaluronidase, especially if the ASO test is negative. A small percentage (10-15%) of people with a post-streptococcal complication will not have an elevated ASO but may have an elevated anti-DNase B or antihyaluronidase titer. This is especially true with glomerulonephritis linked to a recent skin strep infection.



","



The anti-DNase B test may be used to confirm that a recent strep infection with group A Streptococcus is the cause glomerulonephritis (a form of kidney disease) or rheumatic fever. The test may be used in conjunction with an ASO, another test used to detect prior strep infections.
Since complications resulting from strep infections have dropped in the U.S., so has use of the ASO test and anti-DNase B test.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Anti-double stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) is one of a group of autoantibodies called antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Normally, antibodies protect against infection, but autoantibodies are produced when a person's immune system fails to adequately distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self."" They mistakenly attack the body's own healthy cells, causing tissue and organ damage. Anti-dsDNA specifically targets the genetic material (DNA) found in the nucleus of a cell, hence the name ""anti-dsDNA."" The anti-dsDNA test identifies the presence of these autoantibodies in the blood.
While anti-dsDNA may be present at a low level with a number of disorders, it is primarily associated with lupus. Lupus is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disorder that can affect various tissues and/or organs of the body such as the kidneys, joints, blood vessels, skin, heart, lungs, and the brain. (For more on this, read the article on Lupus). The test for anti-dsDNA, along with other autoantibody tests, may be used to help establish a diagnosis of lupus and distinguish it from other autoimmune disorders.
One serious complication of lupus is lupus nephritis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the kidneys, which can lead to protein in the urine, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. It occurs when autoantibodies bind to antigens that have been deposited in the kidneys. In the evaluation of someone with lupus nephritis, a high level (titer) of anti-dsDNA is generally associated with ongoing inflammation and damage to the kidneys.

An anti-dsDNA test is ordered when a person shows signs and symptoms that could be due to lupus and has had a positive ANA test, especially when the result of the ANA test presents as a ""homogeneous"" or ""speckled"" fluorescent pattern. (See the article on ANA for more on this.)
Examples of some signs and symptoms of lupus include:

Muscle pain
Arthritis-like pain in one or more joints (but no or little joint damage)
Red rash that frequently resembles a butterfly across the nose and cheek areas (malar rash)
Low-grade fever
Persistent fatigue, weakness
Skin sensitivity to light
Hair and weight loss
Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet
Inflammation and damage to organs and tissues, including the kidneys, lungs, heart, lining of the heart, central nervous system, and blood vessels
	 

The anti-dsDNA test may be ordered periodically to monitor progress of the disease or flare-ups in a person who has been diagnosed with lupus. It may be repeated when an initial test result is negative but clinical signs and symptoms persist and lupus is strongly suspected. 



","



The results of an anti-dsDNA test are usually considered together with a person's medical history, signs and symptoms, and results of other autoantibody tests.
A high level of anti-dsDNA in the blood is strongly associated with lupus and is often significantly increased during or just prior to a flare-up. When the anti-dsDNA is positive and the person tested has other clinical signs and symptoms associated with lupus, it means that the person tested likely has lupus. This is especially true if an anti-Sm test is also positive.
In the evaluation of someone with lupus nephritis, a high level (titer) of anti-dsDNA is generally associated with ongoing inflammation and damage to the kidneys.
A very low level of anti-dsDNA is considered negative but does not exclude a diagnosis of lupus. Only about 65-85% of those with lupus will have anti-dsDNA.
Low to moderate levels of the autoantibody may be seen with other autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).



","



Anti-dsDNA tests may be performed using different assays. Many laboratories use an anti-dsDNA ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay), but other methods may also be used.
Anti-dsDNA is sometimes present with diseases such as  chronic hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and infectious mononucleosis. It may also be seen in those taking drugs such as procainamide and hydralazine. It is not usually tested or monitored under these conditions.
In addition to testing for anti-double-stranded DNA, there is also an anti-single-stranded DNA (anti-ssDNA) test. This autoantibody is less commonly tested and is not strongly associated with lupus but may be seen with other autoimmune disorders.
ANA consists of a group of antinuclear antibodies. If an ANA test is negative, it indicates that the entire group is negative. Since anti-dsDNA is a member of this group, it does not need to be ordered separately when an ANA test is negative.



","



The anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) test is used to help diagnose lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) in a person who has a positive result on a test for antinuclear antibody (ANA) and has clinical signs and symptoms that suggest lupus.
Typically, an ANA test is the first test performed to evaluate an individual for an autoimmune disorder. While a positive ANA test is seen in about 95% of lupus cases, it may be seen in many other conditions as well. The anti-dsDNA test is fairly specific for lupus; however, only 65-85% of people with lupus may be positive; that is, a negative anti-dsDNA does not rule out lupus. If a person has a positive ANA, an anti-dsDNA test may be used to distinguish lupus from other autoimmune disorders that have similar signs and symptoms.
An anti-dsDNA test may be ordered along with a test for anti-Sm (Smith antibody), another antinuclear autoantibody associated with lupus, to help establish a diagnosis. The anti-Sm test may be ordered as part of an extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel. Depending upon clinical signs and the healthcare practitioner's suspicions, other autoantibodies may also be ordered to help distinguish between, and rule out, other autoimmune disorders. Examples include tests for histone antibody (drug-induced lupus) and antiphospholipid antibodies.
The anti-dsDNA test may be used to assess disease activity in a person who has been diagnosed with lupus. Those with lupus often have flare-ups in which symptoms worsen and then subside. An increased anti-dsDNA level may be seen prior to and during these flare-ups. In particular, this test may be used to monitor lupus nephritis, a serious complication of lupus that can cause kidney damage and inflammation. This can lead to protein in the urine, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. It occurs when the autoantibodies bind to antigens that have been deposited in the kidneys.

Liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM-1) antibodies are autoantibodies, proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize and target its own enzyme called cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), a protein found primarily in liver cells. The development of anti-LKM-1 antibodies is strongly associated with type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of anti-LKM-1 (or antibody against CYP2D6) in the blood.
Autoimmune hepatitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the liver that can lead to liver cirrhosis and, in some cases, to liver failure. It is hepatitis that is not due to another identifiable cause, such as a viral infection, exposure to a drug or toxin, a hereditary disorder, or alcohol abuse. Anyone can develop the disorder, but the majority of those affected are women.
There is general agreement that there are two main types of autoimmune hepatitis (debate continues as to whether there is a distinct third type). Type 1 is the most common form of autoimmune hepatitis in the United States and is associated with the presence of smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) in the blood. Type 2 is less common and tends to be more severe. It is associated with anti-LKM-1 antibodies and primarily affects young girls and is more common in Europe than in the United States.

When you have hepatitis that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to an autoimmune-related process


","



The anti-LKM-1 test may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner is investigating an individual's liver disease and wants to distinguish between different causes of liver injury. It may be ordered along with other testing, such as an SMA and ANA test. These tests are usually ordered when a person presents with signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and jaundice, and has abnormal findings on routine liver tests.
Signs and symptoms associated with autoimmune hepatitis may also include:

Itching
An enlarged liver
Joint aches
Abdominal discomfort
Abnormal blood vessels in the skin (spider angiomas)
Nausea or vomiting
Dark urine
Loss of appetite
Pale or clay-colored stools
Muscle pain (myalgia)
In women, lack of menstrual periods (amenorrhea)
Skin rashes
Fluid buildup (edema)

Many of these signs and symptoms are not specific for autoimmune hepatitis; they are also seen with other causes of liver injury and with other conditions.



","



A high amount or titer of anti-LKM-1 indicates that it is likely that the person tested has type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, but the result is not definitive. A liver biopsy may be performed to evaluate liver tissue for damage and scarring to help confirm the diagnosis.
If the anti-LKM-1 test is negative, but SMA and/or ANA are positive, then the person likely has type 1 autoimmune hepatitis.
If both are negative, then the person's symptoms are likely due to a cause other than autoimmune hepatitis. However, the condition is not entirely ruled out. Not all people with autoimmune hepatitis will produce anti-LKM-1 or SMA antibodies; some people produce other autoantibodies that are rarely tested.



","



Levels of anti-LKM-1 are not closely related to the severity of a person's symptoms or to that person's prognosis. Levels may vary over time.
Those with type 2 autoimmune hepatitis may also have other autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes or thyroiditis.
People with chronic hepatitis C may sometimes develop a different type of anti-LKM antibody, sometimes referred to as anti-LKM3. This type of antibody is not detected with the usual anti-LKM-1 test methods and is not typically tested for.
The ANA test is often performed along with an SMA test. It is a marker of an autoimmune process and is associated with several autoimmune disorders, including type 1 autoimmune hepatitis.



",,"



The liver kidney microsome type 1 antibody (anti-LKM-1 or CYP2D6 antibody) test is primarily used along with a smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and an antinuclear antibodies (ANA) test to help diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and to differentiate between the two major types, type 1 and type 2.
These tests may be used to follow up abnormal liver test findings, such as persistently increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), or bilirubin. Additional tests may be ordered, such as immunoglobulins, as these may be increased with autoimmune hepatitis and/or hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C, to rule out viral hepatitis.

","



Antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are autoantibodies that are strongly associated with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis. This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of AMA in the blood.
Primary biliary cholangitis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts inside the liver. It is a slow-progressing disease that causes worsening liver destruction and blockage of the bile flow. Blocked bile ducts can lead to a build-up of harmful substances within the liver and may eventually lead to permanent scarring (cirrhosis). PBC is found most frequently in women between the ages of 35 and 60. About 90-95% of those affected by PBC will have significant titers of antimitochondrial antibodies.
AMA are autoantibodies that develop against antigens within the body. There are nine types of AMA antigens (M1 – M9) of which M2 and M9 are the most likely to cause illness (clinically significant). The presence of the M2 type of AMA has been particularly evident in PBC, while the other types may be found in other conditions. Some laboratories offer the AMA-M2 as a more specific test for PBC.
For more information on PBC, see the links in the Related Content section.

When you have abnormal results on a liver panel and/or symptoms that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to PBC


","



The AMA or AMA-M2 test is ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has an autoimmune disorder such as PBC that is affecting the liver. A person may have symptoms that include:

Itching (pruritus)
Jaundice
Fatigue
Abdominal pain
Enlarged liver

Many of those affected with early PBC do not have any symptoms. The condition is often initially identified because a person has abnormal results on a liver panel (elevated liver enzymes), especially alkaline phosphatase (ALP).
An AMA or AMA-M2 test may be ordered along with or following a variety of tests that are used to help diagnose and/or rule out other causes of liver disease or injury. These causes can include infections, such as viral hepatitis, drugs, alcohol abuse, toxins, genetic conditions, metabolic conditions, and autoimmune hepatitis.



","



A high AMA or AMA-M2 level (titer) in the blood indicates that the most likely cause of symptoms and/or liver damage is PBC. The level of AMA is not related to the severity of PBC symptoms or to a person's prognosis.
A negative AMA or AMA-M2 means that it is likely that a person's symptoms are due to something other than PBC, but the result does not rule out the condition. About 5-10% of those with PBC will not have significant amounts of AMA or AMA-M2.



","



By themselves, AMA and AMA-M2 are not diagnostic of PBC, but in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of PBC can be made. A liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristic signs of PBC in the liver tissue and to confirm the diagnosis but is not always necessary. Imaging scans of the liver may also be ordered to look for bile duct obstructions.
About 50% of the cases of PBC will be discovered before a person has noticeable symptoms.



","



The antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) test or the AMA-M2 test may be ordered to help diagnose primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).
Other tests that may be ordered include:

Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA)
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
IgM level
Bilirubin
Albumin
Prothrombin time (PT)
C-reactive protein (CRP)

These tests often help detect PBC, distinguishing it from other autoimmune conditions causing liver damage, and may be useful in helping to predict whether a person may need a liver transplant.

In women, to assess ovarian function and menopausal status; in the evaluation of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or to evaluate the effectiveness of ovarian cancer treatment; in an infant, to evaluate the presence of external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) and/or function of the testicles in an infant boy


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a hormone produced by reproductive tissues, including the testicles in males and the ovaries in females. The role of AMH and the amount normally present varies depending upon sex and age. This test measures AMH in the blood.
Very early in the development of a baby boy, AMH is produced by the testicles, inhibiting the development of female reproductive organs while promoting the development of other male reproductive organs. In boys, the level of AMH remains high until puberty, when it begins to taper off.
In girls, low levels of AMH are produced, thus allowing the development of female reproductive structures. The AMH level in young girls remains low until puberty, when the ovaries begin to produce it and levels increase. AMH will then steadily decline in women over their reproductive years, becoming very low and eventually undetectable after menopause.
AMH is important for a woman during her childbearing years. At birth, a female has about one million eggs (oocytes), which then decrease naturally in number during childhood to about 500,000. Only a tiny number of these remaining eggs will go through follicle maturation – one at a time as part of a woman's monthly menstrual cycle. AMH has a balancing effect on the monthly cyclical actions of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) during the process of egg maturation and release (ovulation). The amount of AMH present is a reflection of this follicular growth.
Studies have shown that the AMH level may be useful in determining a woman's remaining egg maturation potential (ovarian reserve) and her likelihood of conceiving. AMH declines over time during childbearing years, drops significantly as menopause approaches, and typically becomes almost undetectable after menopause. Determining the AMH level may be useful in evaluating a woman's current fertility status and may predict the onset of menopause.
Elevated AMH levels have been associated with a condition affecting the ovaries known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The excess follicles that occur in this syndrome produce abnormally large amounts of AMH.
AMH also plays a vital part in sexual differentiation in the fetus. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, a developing baby has the potential to develop either male or female reproductive organs. Production of AMH and androgens by the two testicles that are present in a baby boy inhibits development of female reproductive organs (the Müllerian ducts found in both male and female fetuses) and promotes the formation of other male reproductive organs. If a sufficient amount of AMH is not available or absent during this process, then both male and basic female organs may develop. A baby born with ambiguous genitalia may not be instantly recognized as either male or female.
AMH may be elevated in some ovarian tumors (benign or cancerous). If a tumor produces the hormone, then the AMH test can be used as a tumor marker to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to monitor for recurrence.

When a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate a woman's fertility, predict onset of menopause, suspects PCOS, or wants to evaluate the cause of male characteristics in a female (virilization); sometimes prior to some assisted reproductive procedures; periodically when a woman is undergoing treatment for an AMH-producing ovarian cancer; when it is suspected that the testicles of an infant boy are absent, hidden, or not functioning properly


","



An AMH test may be ordered in women when evaluating ovarian function and fertility issues, especially when considering assisted reproduction procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF). It may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether a woman has entered menopause.
AMH may be ordered when a woman has signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Some of these include:

Abnormal uterine bleeding
Acanthosis nigricans
Acne
Absence of menstrual cycle (amenorrhea)
Decreased breast size
Enlarged ovaries
Excess face and body hair (hirsutism) involving male hair growth patterns, such as hair on the face, sideburn area, chin, upper lip, lower abdominal midline, chest, areola, lower back, buttock, and inner thigh
Weight gain/obesity, with fat distribution in center of the body
Skin tags in the armpits or neck
Thinning hair, with male pattern baldness

AMH may be ordered periodically for a woman with an AMH-producing ovarian cancer to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to monitor for recurrence.
An AMH test may be ordered when an infant has ambiguous genitalia or when a male child's testicles have not descended properly.
An AMH test may be ordered when a female begins to develop male characteristics (virilization).



","



Women
During a woman's childbearing years, a decreased level of AMH may indicate a low number and quality of eggs (low ovarian reserve) with diminishing fertility, resulting in minimal or less responsiveness to IVF treatment. It can also indicate that the ovaries are not functioning normally (premature ovarian failure). Increased AMH may indicate an increased or even excessive responsiveness to IVF and a need to tailor the procedure accordingly.
A decreasing level and/or significant decline in AMH may signal the imminent onset of menopause or that a woman has entered menopause. Negative to low levels of AMH are normal in a female during infancy and after menopause.
An increased level of AMH is often seen with PCOS but is not diagnostic of this condition.
When AMH is used as a tool to monitor an AMH-producing ovarian cancer, then a decrease in AMH indicates a response to treatment while an increase may indicate cancer recurrence.
Infants
In a male infant, absence or low levels of AMH may indicate a problem with the AMH gene located on chromosome 19 that directs AMH production and may be seen with absent or dysfunctional testicles. Lack of male hormones may result in ambiguous genitalia and may cause abnormal internal reproductive structures. Normal levels of AMH and androgens in a male infant whose testicles have not descended indicate that they are present and functional but not physically located where they are supposed to be.
In a female who develops male characteristics, if the AMH levels are in the male reference range, it is most likely coming from a tumor or testicular tissue and if the levels are in the female range, it is likely from the adrenal glands.



","



Some in the medical community are advocating the use of AMH as a more routine test, for predicting the end of fertility and the onset of menopause, but there is not a consensus on this use. It is not considered a diagnostic or ""stand-alone"" test, but one that supports the diagnosis of one of the conditions mentioned.
Other female hormones fluctuate with a woman's monthly cycle; however, AMH is produced by growing follicles at a relatively steady rate throughout the month. It is also not affected by oral contraceptives or pregnancy. 



","



Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is not a routinely ordered test but may be useful in specific circumstances.
AMH test in women: 
Women of childbearing age may have an AMH test ordered along with other hormone tests, such as estradiol and FSH, to estimate the remaining time left to conceive (ovarian reserve) while being evaluated for infertility. These tests are useful in evaluating ovarian function and possibly in predicting the onset of menopause. In these cases, the clinical use is however best confined to women seeking fertility rather than predicting time to menopause.
AMH may sometimes be ordered for a woman who will be undergoing assisted reproduction procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF); the concentration of AMH present is related to her likely responsiveness to treatment. A low level of AMH reflects poor ovarian response, indicating that a decreased number of eggs would be retrieved after ovarian stimulation. For this purpose, it is typically ordered along with other hormone tests and a transvaginal ultrasound (to count the number of follicles as a reflection of the woman's egg supply).
AMH may be used to determine whether a woman has entered menopause.
An AMH test may be used to evaluate polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). AMH may be elevated due to the increased number of follicles present.
Some ovarian cancers produce increased levels of AMH. If the hormone is initially elevated, then the test can be used as a tumor marker to help evaluate response to treatment and monitor for recurrence.
AMH test in infants
In an infant with external genitals that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia), an AMH test may be ordered along with chromosome testing, hormone testing, and sometimes imaging scans to help determine the sex of the baby.
In an infant boy born with no visible testicles, low levels of AMH may account for the ambiguity of genitalia. If the testicles have not descended but are present in the abdomen, this test may be used to help determine whether they are functioning normally by measuring the AMH level.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Anti-muscle-specific kinase (anti-MuSK) antibodies are autoantibodies, proteins produce by the immune system that mistakenly attack proteins called muscle-specific kinases. This test detects these autoantibodies in the blood of people with myasthenia gravis (MG), a rare but often severe autoimmune disease that causes muscle fatigue and weakness.
Muscle-specific kinases are proteins found where nerve endings and muscle fibers come together (neuromuscular junctions). Although the cause of MG is not fully understood, it is thought that the anti-MuSK antibodies interfere with the transmission of signals between nerves and muscles.
MG is typically first noticed when it causes weakness in eye muscles and symptoms such as drooping eyelid(s) and/or double vision. This is often referred to as ocular MG and about 15% of people with MG have ocular problems only. From the eye muscles, MG can spread over time to facial and neck muscles, causing weakness, slurred speech, difficulty chewing and swallowing, and/or difficulty breathing. When muscle weakness spreads from the eyes to the head and neck and other parts of the body, the condition is called generalized MG. Muscle weakness will vary over time. The weakness tends to worsen during physically activity but improves with rest.
Most people with MG have antibodies directed against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR antibodies). However, about 10% to 15% of people with MG do not have AChR antibodies. In cases where AChR antibodies are not detected, a healthcare practitioner will likely order an anti-MuSK antibody test. Estimates of the proportion of people with MG who are negative for AChR antibodies but positive for antibodies to MuSK range from about 6% to 50%. This condition is sometimes called MuSK MG.
According to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, people with anti-MuSK antibodies are more likely to have the generalized form of myasthenia gravis, compared to ocular myasthenia gravis, which affects only the eyes and eyelids. Women are more often affected by autoimmune MuSK MG than men, and onset can occur at any age. People with MuSK MG may respond differently to certain treatments compared to those with AChR-positive MG.

An anti-MuSK antibody test may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms that suggest MG and the result from an AChR antibody test is negative.
Some signs and symptoms of MG include:

Drooping eyelid
Double vision
Decreased control of eye movement
Difficulty swallowing and/or chewing, leading to choking, drooling and gagging
Slurred speech
Weak neck muscles
Trouble holding up your head
Difficulty breathing
Difficulty walking and an altered gait
Specific muscle weakness but normal feelings/sensations
Muscle weakness that worsens during physical activity and improves with rest




","



MuSK antibodies are not normally present in the blood. A negative anti-MuSK antibody test means it is less likely that you have MG. However, a negative result does not rule out MG. In about 6% to 10% of MG cases, neither AChR nor MuSK antibodies are present. These individuals are said to have double-seronegative MG. Results from other tests for autoantibodies, such as anti-LRP4 (LDL-receptor-related protein 4) antibody test and anti-striated muscle antibody test, may aid in establishing a diagnosis.
If you have a positive test result for anti-MuSK antibodies and symptoms of MG, then it is likely that you have autoimmune muscle-specific kinase myasthenia gravis.



","



People who have MG are more likely to also have other autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.



","



An anti-MuSK antibody test is used to help diagnose myasthenia gravis (MG) in people with signs and symptoms associated with MG but who test negative for AChR antibodies. Testing is used to distinguish MG from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as chronic muscle fatigue and weakness.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target and attack specific proteins within neutrophils (a type of white blood cell). ANCA testing detects and measures the amount of these autoantibodies in the blood. Two of the most common ANCAs are the autoantibodies that target the proteins myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3). These are called pANCAs and cANCAs, respectively.
There are two types of ANCA tests:
The first type is called Indirect Immunofluorescence (IIF). This uses neutrophils fixed onto a slide. For the test, serum from your blood sample is mixed with the neutrophils on the slide and any ANCAs in the sample attach to the neutrophil proteins. Treatment of the slide with a fluorochrome-stained antibody reacts with any ANCA present. This produces a pattern of fluorescence that can be seen under a microscope. The pattern may be identified as cytoplasmic (cANCA), perinuclear (pANCA), or atypical ANCA (X-ANCA).
Alternatively, the laboratory may test for antibodies to myeloperoxidase or to proteinase 3 directly using an ELISA assay.
A combination of both fluorescence and ELISA tests are often done when testing suspected cases of vasculitis.
ANCA may be present in several autoimmune disorders that cause inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure:

Systemic vasculitis is a group of disorders associated with damage and weakening of blood vessels. It can cause tissue and organ damage due to the narrowing and obstruction of blood vessels and the subsequent loss of blood supply. It can also produce areas of weakness in blood vessel walls, known as aneurysms, which have the potential to rupture. The symptoms experienced by a person with systemic vasculitis depend upon the degree of autoimmune activity and the parts of the body involved. A few types of systemic vasculitis are closely associated with the production of ANCA:

	
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)
Microscopic polyangiitis
Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome)
Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)



(For more information on these specific conditions, see the article on Vasculitis).
cANCA/PR3 antibodies are most frequently seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis and pANCA/ MPO antibodies are most often associated with microscopic polyangiitis. However, both may be seen in all three types with varying degrees of reactivity.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with swollen and damaged tissues in the lining of the colon. UC can be difficult to distinguish from Crohn disease (CD), another type of IBD that can affect any part of the intestinal tract. The presence of atypical ANCA is generally associated with UC (80% of patients), while only 20% of CD patients may be positive.

","



Vasculitis
An ANCA test and/or tests for MPO and PR3 are ordered when you have signs and symptoms that suggest systemic autoimmune vasculitis. Early in the disease, symptoms may be vague or nonspecific, such as fever, fatigue, weight loss, muscle and/or joint aches, and night sweats. As the disease progresses, damage to blood vessels throughout the body may cause signs and symptoms associated with complications involving various tissues and organs. A few examples include:

Eyes — red, itchy eyes or ""pink eye"" (conjunctivitis); problems with sight (blurry vision, loss of vision)
Ears — hearing loss
Nose — runny nose or other upper respiratory symptoms that do not go away
Skin — rashes and/or granulomas
Lungs — cough and/or difficulty breathing
Kidneys —protein in the urine (proteinuria)


Testing may also be performed periodically when you are being treated for autoimmune vasculitis.
Inflammatory Bowel Disease
An ANCA test may be ordered with a test for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) when you have signs and symptoms that suggest inflammatory bowel disease and your healthcare practitioner is attempting to distinguish between Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.
Symptoms of an IBD may include:

Abdominal pain and cramps
Diarrhea
Rectal bleeding
Fever
Fatigue
In some people, joint, skin, bone, and organ-related symptoms
Children may also have delayed development and growth retardation.




","



Results of ANCA tests must be interpreted carefully, taking several factors into account. A healthcare practitioner will consider your signs and symptoms in addition to results of the laboratory tests and other types of tests, such as imaging studies.
Vasculitis
Positive test results for ANCA, PR3, and/or MPO help support a diagnosis of systemic autoimmune vasculitis and distinguish between different types of vasculitis. However, to confirm a diagnosis, a biopsy of an affected site is often required.
Negative ANCA tests results mean it is unlikely that your symptoms are due to an autoimmune vasculitis.
For a positive result on the indirect immunofluorescence microscopy method, different ANCA patterns may be seen:

Perinuclear (pANCA) – most of the fluorescence occurs near the nucleus; about 90% of samples with a pANCA pattern will have MPO antibodies.
Cytoplasmic (cANCA) – the fluorescence occurs throughout the cytoplasm of the cell; about 85% of samples with a cANCA pattern will have PR3 antibodies.
Atypical ANCA – a positive fluorescence staining is present but does not resemble a pANCA or a cANCA pattern.
Negative ANCA – very little or no fluorescence


If an ANCA test result is positive, then an additional step may be performed to determine the amount of antibody present. This is called a titer. To determine the titer, a serum sample is diluted in steps and each dilution is tested for the presence of the antibody. The greatest dilution at which the antibody can be detected is the titer. For example, if a serum tests positive after being diluted 64-fold, the titer is 1:64. The higher the titer, the more antibody is present in the blood.
ANCA levels can change over time and may sometimes be used in a general way to monitor disease activity and/or response to therapy. However, in many individuals, titer levels may not correlate with the extent of disease activity.

Positive test results for PR3 antibodies and for cANCA or pANCA are seen in more than 80% of patients with active granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis).
Positive test results for MPO antibodies and for pANCA are consistent with microscopic polyangitis, glomerulonephritis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome), and Goodpasture syndrome. MPO and pANCA may also be present in other autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome.


The following table shows results that may be seen in some vasculitis conditions.

","



Antiphospholipid antibodies are a group of immune proteins (antibodies) that the body mistakenly produces against itself in an autoimmune response to phospholipids. Tests can detect these autoantibodies that bind to phospholipids and, in a way that is not well understood, increase the risk of excessive blood clotting.
Several tests are available, including:

Cardiolipin antibodies (anticardiolipin antibodies)
Lupus anticoagulant assays, these include activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), dRVVT (dilute Russell viper venom time), kaolin (or silica) clotting time, and PTT mixing tests
Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies

Phospholipids are structural components of cell membranes and play a crucial role in blood clotting. Phospholipds are critical to platelet function in addition to various coagulation co-factors. When antiphospholipid antibodies are produced, they interfere with the clotting process. They increase an affected person's risk of developing recurrent inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in arteries and veins, which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, and/or miscarriages.
Antiphospholipid antibodies are also associated with low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and with the risk of recurrent miscarriages (especially in the second and third trimester), premature labor, and pre-eclampsia.
One or more antiphospholipid antibodies have been identified in various conditions. Some examples are:
Autoimmune disorders

Lupus
Rheumatoid arthritis
Systemic sclerosis

Infections

HIV
Mononucleosis
Rubella

Cancers

Solid tumors (colon, lung, etc.)
Leukemias
Lymphomas

Use of certain drugs

Procainamide
Phenothiazines
Oral contraceptives

The presence of phospholipid antibodies in some instances may be temporary and they have been identified in some individuals who have no detectable illnesses.
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), also called Hughes syndrome, is a recognized group of signs and symptoms that includes the formation of blood clots, miscarriages, platelet deficiency (thrombocytopenia), and the presence of one or more antiphospholipid antibodies. APS can be primary with no underlying autoimmune disorder or secondary, existing with a diagnosed autoimmune disorder.
The 14th International Congress on Antiphospholipid Antibodies Task Force criteria for identifying APS requires testing for cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, and beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies when one of two clinical problems exist, blood clots (thrombosis) or pregnancy morbidity.

It also may be ordered when a woman has had recurrent miscarriages and/or as a follow-up to a prolonged PTT test.
When one of the tests is positive, it may be repeated several weeks later to determine whether the antibody is temporary or persistent. Antiphospholipid testing may be done when clinical signs suggest the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome.
When a person with a diagnosed autoimmune disorder tests negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, one or more of the tests may be repeated at regular intervals to screen for the development of an antiphospholipid antibody.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting the results of antiphospholipid antibody tests. A negative result means only that the specific antibody tested was not present at the time of the test.
Low to moderate levels of one or more antibodies may occur temporarily due to an infection or drug or may appear as a person ages. These levels are often not considered significant but must be examined in conjunction with a person's symptoms and other clinical information.
In some cases, a person may have one or more immunoglobulin classes of a specific antibody present or absent. For instance, the person may have significant quantities of IgG and IgM cardiolipin antibodies or may only be positive for the less frequently tested IgA cardiolipin antibody.
Moderate to high levels of one or more antiphospholipid antibodies, which persist when tested again 12 weeks later, indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody.
If tests indicate the presence of the lupus anticoagulant and it persists when retested, then it is likely that the person is positive for the lupus anticoagulant. People who have one or more antiphospholipid antibodies and those that are diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome can have an increased risk of having recurrent blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, and/or low platelets (thrombocytopenia).
Test results cannot predict the likelihood of complications, the type, or the severity in a particular person. Some people will have a variety of recurrent problems while others may never experience any difficulties. Examples of this include an asymptomatic individual who is diagnosed with antiphospholipid antibodies following a prolonged PTT test that is done for another reason (such as a pre-surgical screen) and an asymptomatic elderly person who has developed an antiphospholipid antibody.
Transient antiphospholipid antibodies may be seen in people who have inflammation, autoimmune disorders, infections, or cancer.



","



Occasionally, antiphospholipid antibody testing may be ordered to help determine the cause of a positive VDRL/RPR test for syphilis. The reagents used to test for syphilis contain phospholipids and can cause a false-positive result in those with antiphospholipid antibodies.
False-positive test results may be seen in people who take drugs such as quinidine, procainamide, phenytoin, and penicillin.

Antiphospholipid antibody testing is used to help determine the cause of:

Inappropriate blood clot formation (unexplained thrombotic episode, excessive clotting)
Recurrent miscarriage
Low platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
Prolonged PTT test

Depending on a person's signs and symptoms and medical history, a healthcare practitioner may order one or more of these tests to help detect the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and/or to help diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome (APS):

Cardiolipin antibodies (IgG, IgM, and sometimes IgA) are frequently ordered since they are the most common antiphospholipid antibodies.
Lupus anticoagulant assays (e.g., RVVT, LA-sensitive PTT) if a person has a prolonged PTT test.
Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 testing may be ordered along with the other antiphospholipid antibodies to detect their presence and to provide the healthcare practitioner with additional information.

If an antiphospholipid antibody is detected, the same test(s) may be repeated 12 weeks later to determine whether their presence is persistent or temporary.
Testing may also be performed to help diagnose and/or evaluate a person with an autoimmune disorder, which can occur along with disorders like lupus. If a person with an autoimmune disorder tests negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, testing may be repeated to determine if an antibody has developed in the course of the disease.

Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) are immune proteins that are frequently present in people who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This test detects ASCA in the blood.
S. cerevisiae are common yeast found in various foods. The correlation between the presence of antibodies to S. cerevisiae and their involvement in the inflammatory bowel disease process is not understood at this time.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders, thought to be due to an autoimmune process, characterized by swollen and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The symptoms and severity of IBD vary from person to person and may fluctuate over time. Many of those affected experience flare-ups followed by periods of lessened symptoms or even remission.
The two most common types of IBD are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). CD can affect any part of the intestinal tract, from mouth to anus, but is primarily found in the small intestine and/or in the colon, while UC occurs in the colon.
The diagnosis of CD or UC is usually made on the basis of endoscopic testing and the examination of biopsy samples from the intestines. Because both CD and UC can be found in the colon, even using biopsies it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the two. When this occurs, ASCA testing may be helpful as ASCA is much more frequently found in people with CD than in those with UC.
There are two classes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies produced by the body, ASCA IgG and ASCA IgA. Testing usually includes both classes. ASCA IgG may predict the severity of the disease and the need for surgery as a treatment option.

Signs and symptoms of an IBD may include:

Abdominal pain and cramps
Diarrhea
Rectal bleeding

Fatigue
Joint, skin, bone and organ-related symptoms
Delayed development and growth retardation in children

A positive ASCA result is not diagnostic of CD, UC, or of an IBD, but it does make it more likely that a person with symptoms has an IBD.
Results of ASCA testing are often interpreted in conjunction with the results of pANCA testing:

If ASCA is positive and pANCA is negative, then it is likely that the person has CD.
If ASCA is negative and pANCA is positive, then it is likely that the person has UC.

A negative result for ASCA and pANCA does necessarily rule out IBD. A person with negative test results may still have CD, UC, or another IBD.
The presence of multiple antibodies (ASCA, anti-CBir1, anti-Omp C) may indicate the likelihood of a more aggressive disease, but negative results do not rule out aggressive disease.

The test for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) is used to help distinguish between Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two most common types of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Testing usually includes detecting two different classes of ASCA in the blood, IgG and IgA.
IBDs are primarily diagnosed through non-laboratory evaluations, such as a biopsy of the intestine. In some cases, however, it can be difficult to distinguish between CD and UC. An ASCA test is often ordered along with a test for perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) to help determine which type of IBD a person has. The presence of ASCA is more common in CD, while pANCA is more common in UC.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Antistreptolysin O (ASO) is an antibody targeted against streptolysin O, a toxic enzyme produced by group A Streptococcus bacteria. ASO and anti-DNase B are the most common of several antibodies that are produced by the body's immune system in response to a strep infection with group A Streptococcus. This test measures the amount of ASO in the blood.
Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) is the bacterium responsible for causing strep throat and a variety of other infections, including skin infections (pyoderma, impetigo, cellulitis). In most cases, strep infections are identified and treated with antibiotics, and the infections resolve.
When a strep infection does not cause identifiable symptoms, goes untreated, or is treated ineffectively, however, complications, namely rheumatic fever and a type of kidney disease (glomerulonephritis), can sometimes develop, especially in young children. These secondary conditions have become much less prevalent in the U.S. because of routine strep testing, but they still do occur. These conditions can cause serious complications such as heart damage, acute kidney dysfunction, tissue swelling (edema), and high blood pressure (hypertension). The ASO test can be used to help determine if these are due to a recent group A strep infection.

","



The ASO test is ordered when a person has symptoms that a health practitioner suspects may be due to an illness caused by a previous strep infection. It is ordered when the symptoms emerge, usually in the weeks following a sore throat or skin infection when the bacteria are no longer present in the throat or on the skin.
Some symptoms of rheumatic fever may include:

Fever
Joint swelling and pain in more than one joint, especially in the ankles, knees, elbows and wrists, sometimes moving from one joint to another
Small, painless nodules under the skin
Rapid, jerky movements (Sydenham's chorea)
Skin rash
Sometimes the heart can become inflamed (carditis); this may not produce any symptoms but also may lead to shortness of breath, heart palpitations, or chest pain

Some symptoms of glomerulonephritis may include:

Fatigue, decreased energy
Decreased amount of urine
Bloody urine
Rash
Joint pain
Swelling (edema)
High blood pressure

However, these symptoms can be seen in other conditions.
The test may be performed twice, with samples collected about two weeks apart, for acute and convalescent ASO titers. This is done to determine if the antibody level is rising, falling, or remaining the same.



","



ASO antibodies are produced about a week to a month after an initial strep infection. The amount of ASO antibody (titer) peaks at about 3 to 5 weeks after the illness and then tapers off but may remain detectable for several months after the strep infection has resolved. Over 80% of patients with acute rheumatic fever and 95% of patients with acute glomerulonephritis due to streptococci have elevated ASO.
A negative ASO or ASO that is present at very low titers means the person tested most likely has not had a recent strep infection. This is especially true if a sample taken 10 to 14 days later is also negative (low titer of antibody) and if an anti-DNase B test is also negative (low titer of antibody). A small percentage of people with a complication related to a strep infection will not have an elevated ASO. This is especially true with glomerulonephritis that may develop after a skin strep infection.
An elevated titer of antibody (positive ASO) or an ASO titer that is rising means that it is likely that the person tested has had a recent strep infection. ASO titers that are initially high and then decline suggest that an infection has occurred and may be resolving.
The ASO test does not predict whether complications will occur following a strep infection, nor does it predict the type or severity of the disease. If symptoms of rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis are present, an elevated ASO level may be used to help confirm the diagnosis.



","



Use of some antibiotics and corticosteroids may decrease ASO antibody levels.



","



The ASO test is primarily used to help determine whether a recent strep infection with group A Streptococcus:

Is the cause of a person's or glomerulonephritis, a form of kidney disease
Caused rheumatic fever in a person with signs and symptoms

The test may be ordered by itself or along with an anti-DNase B, another test used to detect recent strep infections.
In most cases, strep infections are identified and treated with antibiotics and the infections resolve. In cases where they do not cause identifiable symptoms and/or go untreated, however, complications can develop in some people, especially young children. The test, therefore, is ordered if a person presents with symptoms suggesting rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis and has had a recent history of sore throat or a confirmed streptococcal infection.
Since the incidence of post-streptococcal complications has dropped in the U.S., so has the use of the ASO test.

antithrombin,"['Functional Antithrombin III', 'AT III', 'AT 3']","

Typically, no test preparation is needed. Note that testing for antithrombin deficiency is not recommended if a person's condition may affect the antithrombin level (e.g., DIC) and/or after the person has been treated with heparin for a blood clot.


","

To help investigate the cause of recurrent inappropriate blood clotting; to help diagnose an antithrombin deficiency


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Antithrombin is a protein produced by the liver that helps regulate blood clot formation (i.e., a naturally-occurring mild blood thinner). Antithrombin testing measures the activity (function) and the amount (quantity) of antithrombin in an individual's blood and is used to evaluate the person for excessive blood clotting.
Normally, when a blood vessel is injured, the body initiates a complex process called hemostasis to form a blood clot and prevent further blood loss. Part of this complex process involves the activation of several proteins called coagulation factors in a series of steps referred to as the coagulation cascade. Antithrombin helps to regulate this process by inhibiting the action of several activated coagulation factors, including thrombin and factors Xa, IXa, and XIa, to slow down the process and prevent excessive or inappropriate clotting (thrombosis).
People with an excessive clotting disorder due to an inherited or acquired antithrombin deficiency are at increased risk of developing blood clots, especially in deep veins such as in the legs (known as deep venous thrombosis or DVT). Inherited deficiencies are rare, affecting about 1 in 5,000 people. For people who inherit one defective gene and one normal gene (heterozygous), episodes of inappropriate blood clot formation typically start at about 20 to 30 years of age. Very rarely, a person may inherit two defective antithrombin genes, resulting in severe clotting problems soon after birth. 
Acquired antithrombin deficiencies may occur at any age. They are associated with a variety of conditions that cause decreased production, excessive consumption, or loss of antithrombin. These conditions include liver disease, extensive thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), blood loss, cancer, and nephrotic syndrome – a form of kidney disease.
There are two types of antithrombin deficiency. With type 1, antithrombin functions normally, but the quantity is insufficient. With type 2, there is a sufficient quantity of antithrombin produced, but it is dysfunctional. These types can be differentiated and assessed by testing:

Antithrombin activity, which evaluates the function of antithrombin
Antithrombin antigen, which measures the quantity of antithrombin present

","

A couple of months after getting a blood clot (thrombotic episode) or when you are not responding as expected to heparin anticoagulation therapy


","



Antithrombin activity testing is ordered, along with other tests for excessive clotting disorders (such as protein C and protein S and lupus anticoagulant), when a person has been experiencing recurrent blood clots. Antithrombin testing should be performed to evaluate an individual for an excessive clotting disorder only after a blood clot has been treated and resolved as both the presence of the clot, and the therapy used to treat it, will affect antithrombin results.

Antithrombin testing may also be ordered when a person is not responding as expected to heparin anticoagulation, when unusually high doses of heparin are necessary to achieve the desired level of anticoagulation.



","



Decreased antithrombin activity and decreased quantities of antithrombin antigen suggest a type 1 antithrombin deficiency. In this case, the activity is decreased because there is less antithrombin available to participate in clotting regulation.
Reduced antithrombin activity and normal levels of antithrombin antigen suggest a type 2 antithrombin deficiency. This means that there is sufficient antithrombin protein, but it is not functioning as it should. In either case, a deficiency increases the affected person's risk of developing an inappropriate blood clot.
If the antithrombin activity is normal, then the antithrombin antigen test is usually not performed. In this case, the antithrombin is functioning adequately and the recurrent thrombotic episodes being investigated are likely due to a cause other than an antithrombin deficiency.
Temporarily or chronically decreased antithrombin levels may be seen with conditions that affect its consumption or production, such as:

DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), an acute or chronic condition characterized by the consumption of clotting factors; an affected person may bleed and/or clot. 
DVT (deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot usually in a deep leg vein)
Liver disease
Nephrotic syndrome
Protein-losing condition
Pulmonary embolism
Heparin therapy (temporary lower antithrombin level)
Infants during the first few days of life (about 50% of healthy adult level)
Estrogen therapy

Increased levels of antithrombin are not usually considered a problem.



","



If a person with an antithrombin deficiency also has other coagulation risks, such as a protein C or S deficiency, a factor V leiden mutation, or oral contraceptive use, then the person may be at a significantly elevated risk of developing a blood clot.

Antithrombin deficiency can increase the risk of recurrent miscarriage.

People with antithrombin deficiency may need preventive anticoagulation therapy prior to medical or surgical procedures.
Antithrombin concentrates and recombinant antithrombin are now available as a medication to temporarily correct acute or chronic antithrombin deficiencies.



","



Antithrombin testing is primarily ordered, along with other tests for excessive clotting disorders, to investigate the cause of recurrent blood clot formation (thrombosis). Testing evaluates the activity (function) and the amount (quantity) of antithrombin and helps identify antithrombin deficiency.
The activity test is performed first, to evaluate whether the total amount of functional antithrombin is normal. If the antithrombin activity is low, then the antithrombin antigen test is performed to determine the quantity of antithrombin present. These two tests can be used to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 antithrombin deficiencies. If a deficiency is detected, both antithrombin tests are typically repeated at a later date to confirm test findings.
Antithrombin testing may sometimes be used to evaluate people who are not responding as expected to heparin. Heparin is an anticoagulant drug that is given to people who have a blood clot or are at an increased risk of forming inappropriate blood clots. The effects of heparin are mediated by antithrombin. Heparin can greatly increase antithrombin activity, thus inhibiting formation of blood clots, but those who are antithrombin-deficient are resistant to heparin treatment.

","

","



Apolipoprotein B-100 (also called apolipoprotein B or apo B) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of lipids and is the main protein constituent of lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, the ""bad cholesterol""). This test measures the amount of apo B in the blood.
Apolipoproteins combine with lipids to transport them throughout the bloodstream. Apolipoproteins provide structural integrity to lipoproteins and shield the water-repellent (hydrophobic) lipids at their center. Most lipoproteins are cholesterol- or triglyceride-rich and carry lipids through the body for uptake by cells.
Chylomicrons are the lipoprotein particles that carry dietary lipids from the digestive tract, via the bloodstream, to tissue – mainly the liver. In the liver, the body repackages these dietary lipids and combines them with apo B-100 to form triglyceride-rich VLDL. This combination is like a taxi full of passengers with apo B-100 as the taxi driver. In the bloodstream, the taxi moves from place to place, releasing one passenger at a time.
An enzyme called lipoprotein lipase (LPL) removes triglycerides from VLDL to produce intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) first and then LDL. Each VLDL particle contains one molecule of apo B-100, which is retained as VLDL loses triglycerides and shrinks to become the more cholesterol-rich LDL. Apo B-100 is recognized by receptors found on the surface of many of the body's cells. These receptors promote the uptake of cholesterol into the cells.
The cholesterol that LDL and apo B-100 transport is vital for cell membrane integrity, sex hormone production, and steroid production. In excess, however, LDL can lead to fatty deposits (plaques) in artery walls and lead to hardening and scarring of the blood vessels. These fatty depositions narrow the vessels in a process termed  atherosclerosis. The atherosclerotic process increases the risk of heart attack.
Apo B-100 levels tend to mirror LDL-C levels, a test routinely ordered as part of a lipid profile. Many experts think that apo B levels may eventually prove to be a better indicator of risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than LDL-C. Some recommend the measurement of apo B to help with risk prediction when a person has multiple risk factors. Other experts disagree; they feel that apo B is only a marginally better alternative and do not recommend its routine use. The clinical utility of apo B and that of other emerging cardiac risk markers such as apo A-I, Lp(a), and hs-CRP has yet to be fully established.

","



Apo B may be measured, along with an apo A-I or other lipid tests, when a healthcare practitioner is trying to evaluate someone's risk of developing CVD and when a person has a personal or family history of heart disease and/or abnormal lipid levels, especially when the person has significantly elevated triglyceride levels.
Sometimes apo B is ordered to monitor a person who is undergoing treatment for high cholesterol.



","



Elevated levels of apo B correspond to elevated levels of LDL-C and to non-HDL-C and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevations may be due to a high-fat diet and/or decreased clearing of LDL from the blood.
Some genetic disorders are the direct (primary) cause of abnormal levels of apo B. For example, familial combined hyperlipidemia is an inherited disorder causing high blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. Abetalipoproteinemia, also called Apolipoprotein B deficiency or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome, is a very rare genetic condition that can cause abnormally low levels of apo B. For more on some of these disorders, see the Related Content section.
Abnormal levels of apo B can also be caused by underlying conditions or other factors (secondary causes). Increased levels of apo B are seen, for example, in:

Diabetes
Use of drugs such as: androgens, beta blockers, diuretics, progestins (synthetic progesterones)
Hypothyroidism
Nephrotic syndrome (a kidney disease)
Pregnancy (levels increase temporarily and decrease again after delivery)
	 

Apo B levels may be decreased with any condition that affects lipoprotein production or affects its synthesis and packaging in the liver. Lower levels are seen with secondary causes such as:

Use of drugs such as: estrogen (in post-menopausal women), lovastatin, simvastatin, niacin, and thyroxine
Hyperthyroidism
Malnutrition
Reye syndrome
Weight reduction
Severe illness
Surgery
Cirrhosis
	 

An increased ratio of apo B to apo A-I may indicate a higher risk of developing CVD.



","



Chylomicrons, the lipoprotein particles that carry dietary lipids to the liver, contain a lipoprotein called apolipoprotein B-48. It is about half the size of apo B-100 and is structurally related to apo B-100. It is not considered a risk factor for atherosclerosis and is not measured as part of the apo-B test. The apo B test is specific for apo B-100.



","



The apolipoprotein B (apo B) test is used, along with other lipid tests, to help determine an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).
This test is not used as a general population screen but may be ordered if a person has a family history of heart disease and/or high cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia). It may be performed, along with other tests, to help diagnose the cause of abnormal lipid levels, especially when someone has elevated triglyceride levels.
A healthcare practitioner may order both an apo A-I (associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the ""good"" cholesterol) and an apo B to determine an apo B/apo A-I ratio. This ratio is sometimes used as an alternative to a total cholesterol/HDL ratio to evaluate risk for developing CVD.
Apo B levels may be ordered to monitor the effectiveness of lipid treatment as an alternative to non-HDL-C (non-HDL-C is the total cholesterol concentration minus the amount of HDL).
In rare cases, an apo B test may be ordered to help diagnose a genetic problem that causes over- or under-production of apo B.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Apolipoprotein (Apo) E is produced under the direction of the APOE gene and is one of five main types of blood lipoproteins (A-E). This test evaluates a person's DNA to determine what combination of APOE forms (genotype) is present. The APOE gene exists in three different forms (alleles) – e2, e3, and e4 – with e3 being the most common allele, found in 60% of the general population. Everyone inherits a pair of APOE genes that is some combination of these three.
APOE e4 has been associated with an increased risk of late onset Alzheimer disease (AD), that is AD that develops after the age of 65. This effect is additive in that one copy of e4 (e2/e4 or e3/e4) carries some increased risk and two copies of e4 (e4/e4) are associated with even more of a risk of developing AD. It is important to note, however, that we are talking about the risk relative to other people at the same age with fewer copies of e4. In terms of lifetime risk, most individuals with APOE e4 will never develop AD and there are many people with AD who are e4 negative.

When you have progressive symptoms of dementia and your healthcare practitioner wants to determine the likelihood that this is due to AD


","



APOE genotyping may sometimes be ordered when an individual has symptoms of progressive dementia, such as:

Loss of memory that affects daily life—forgetting information that was recently learned. This can occur with normal aging, but the information is usually remembered later. This includes forgetting important dates or events, having to rely on memory aids, and asking for the same information again and again.
Difficulty planning or problem solving, such as keeping track of bills and payments
Problems completing usual tasks, such as forgetting how to get to a familiar location
Confusion about place or time—losing track of time, forgetting where you are or how you got there
Increasing difficulty reading or judging distances
Problems speaking or writing—forgetting words, repeating the same thing, struggling with vocabulary
Losing things more frequently and not being able to logically retrace steps to find them
Impaired judgment, such as giving away unusually large amounts of money
Increasing withdrawal from activities, including social, work or family events
Changes in mood and personality, such as increasing anxiety, fear, suspicion and depression

After non-AD causes, such as overmedication, vascular dementia (caused by strokes), and thyroid disease, have been ruled out, APOE genotyping may help determine the probability that dementia is due to Alzheimer disease.



","



People who have symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) and have one or more APOE e4 copies are more likely to have AD. However, it is not diagnostic of AD and should not be used to screen asymptomatic people or their family members. Many individuals who have APOE e4 alleles will never develop AD. Even in symptomatic people, only about 60% of those with late onset AD will have APOE e4 alleles.
Although APOE genotyping may be used clinically by Alzheimer experts, it can only provide additional information about a person with dementia. A definite diagnosis of Alzheimer disease can only be made by examining a person's brain tissue after their death.



",,,"



APOE genotyping is sometimes used as an added test to help in the diagnosis of probable late onset Alzheimer disease (AD) in symptomatic adults. However, the association of the e4 allele with late onset AD does not mean that it causes AD, only that more people with late onset AD have e4 alleles compared to similar aged peers without late onset AD. For this reason, APOE genotyping is referred to as susceptibility or risk factor testing since it indicates whether there is an increased risk of AD but is not specifically diagnostic of AD. For example, if a person has dementia, the presence of APOE e4 may increase the likelihood that the dementia is due to AD but does not prove that it is.
There are no clear-cut tests to diagnose Alzheimer disease during life. Healthcare practitioners can, however, make a reasonably accurate clinical diagnosis of AD by ruling out other potential causes of dementia and checking for a genetic predisposition to AD with APOE genotyping as supplemental information in conjunction with tau protein and beta amyloid testing.

Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) is a protein that helps transport lipids (fats and cholesterol) in the blood. It is recognized by specific cell surface receptors that allow it to deliver lipids to cells for use or storage and to deliver excess lipids to the liver for excretion.
The ApoE protein has three genetic forms that have slightly different compositions. They are called ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE 4. ApoE3 is the most common form. Compared to ApoeE3, ApoE2 is poorly recognized by cell surface receptors whereas ApoE4 binds more tightly to those receptors. People with ApoE2 tend to have higher amounts of lipids in their blood since delivery from blood to cells is impaired by poor binding of ApoE2 to receptors.
Three different genes (termed alleles) are designated as e2, e3, and e4 and code respectively for ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Each person inherits one allele from each parent. A person who has the same allele from each parent is termed homozygous: e2/e2 or e3/e3 or e4/e4. One who has different alleles is termed heterozygous: e2/e3 or e2/e4 or e3/e4.
The APOE genotype test evaluates a person's DNA to determine what APOE forms (alleles) are present. APOE e3/e3 is the most common genotype (seen in well over half of the population) and is considered ""neutral."" Risks of disease are made relative to the e3/e3 population. APOE e4 (as e4/e4 and e4/e3) is found in nearly a quarter of the population and is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis. People with these genotypes could be predisposed to a significantly elevated level of LDL-C (""bad cholesterol"") and triglycerides when their diet is high in saturated fat. The various APOE allele frequencies differ between ethnic populations.
People with the APOE e2 allele tend to have lower LDL-C levels but elevated triglycerides. APOE e2 is also associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia/hyperlipidemia (HPL III or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia), a rare inherited disorder that causes fatty yellowish deposits on the skin called xanthomas, increased triglycerides in the blood, and atherosclerosis that develops at an early age. Importantly, while a large majority of patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia are homozygous for the e2 allele (e2/e2), less than 10% of people with the e2/e2 genotype develop type III hyperlipoproteinemia/hyperlipidemia.

People with the APOE e2/e2 alleles tend to have lower LDL-C levels but elevated triglycerides. APOE e2 is also associated with type III hyperlipoproteinemia/hyperlipidemia. People with APOE e2/e2 alleles are at a higher risk of premature vascular disease, but they may never develop disease. APOE genotyping adds additional information and, if symptoms are present, e2/e2 can help confirm type III hyperlipoproteinemia.
Most cases of apoE-influenced type III hyperlipoproteinemia occur in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that individuals with an e2/e3 genotype may be carriers of disease but may not show signs of lipid dysfunction.



","



APOE genotyping is not available in every laboratory. If a healthcare practitioner recommends this test, the specimen will likely be sent to a reference laboratory and results may take longer to return than they would from a local laboratory.
Alterations in lipid concentrations do not lead directly to vascular disease or atherosclerosis. Other factors, such as obesity, diabetes, and hypothyroidism, also play a role in whether a person actually develops disease. Additionally, APOE genetic tests cannot detect all mutations that may cause type III hyperlipoproteinemia or other lipid-related diseases. Therefore, the absence of a mutation cannot rule out the possibility of disease or carrier status.



",,"



While APOE genotyping is mostly done in research settings, it can be used clinically to help in diagnosis and treatment of elevated lipid levels.
APOE testing may be used to help diagnose type III hyperlipoproteinemia (HPL III or familial dysbetalipoproteinemia) in a person with symptoms that suggest the disorder and to evaluate the potential for the condition in other family members. This is a rare inherited disorder that causes fatty, yellowish deposits on the skin called xanthomas, a high level of triglycerides in the blood, and atherosclerosis that develops at an early age.
APOE genotyping has potential to help guide lipid treatment. In cases of high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, statins are usually considered the treatment of choice to decrease the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is a wide variability in the response to these lipid-lowering drugs that is in part influenced by the APOE genotype. At present, the clinical utility of this type of information is yet to be totally understood.

","



Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) is a protein that has specific roles in the transportation and metabolism of lipids and is the main protein component in high-density lipoprotein (HDL, the ""good cholesterol""). This test measures the amount of apo A-I in the blood.
Lipids alone cannot dissolve in the blood; they are like oil that floats on water. Apolipoproteins are the proteins that combine with lipids to make lipoprotein particles that can transport lipids throughout the bloodstream. Apolipoproteins provide structural integrity to lipoproteins and shield the water-repellent (hydrophobic) lipids at their center.
Most lipoproteins are cholesterol- or triglyceride-rich (two main lipids) and carry them throughout the body for uptake by cells. HDL, however, is like an empty taxi. It goes out to the tissues and picks up excess cholesterol, then transports it back to the liver. In the liver, the cholesterol is either recycled for future use or excreted in bile. HDL's reverse transport is the only way that cells can get rid of excess cholesterol. This reverse transport helps protect the arteries and, if there is enough HDL present, it can even reverse the build-up of fatty plaques, deposits resulting from atherosclerosis that can lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Apolipoprotein A is the taxi driver. It activates the enzymes that load cholesterol from the tissues into HDL and allows HDL to be recognized and bound by receptors in the liver at the end of the transport. There are two forms of apolipoprotein A: apo A-I and apo A-II. Apo A-I is found in greater proportion than apo A-II (about 3 to 1). The concentration of apo A-I can be measured directly and tends to rise and fall with HDL levels. Deficiencies in apo A-I correlate with an increased risk of developing CVD. Apo A-I levels provide more information to help evaluate CVD risk, especially when HDL levels are low.

When you have a low value of HDL-C, high cholesterol and triglycerides (hyperlipidemia), and/or a family history of CVD; when your healthcare provider is trying to assess your risk of developing heart disease; when monitoring the effectiveness of lipid treatment and/or lifestyle changes

Apo A-I may be measured when someone has a personal or family history of abnormal lipid levels and/or premature CVD. It may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner is trying to determine the cause of a person's high cholesterol and/or suspects it may be due to a disorder that is causing a deficiency in apo A-I.
Apo A-I may be ordered along with apo B when a healthcare practitioner wants to check an apo B/apo A-I ratio as a CVD risk indicator, to evaluate the ""bad"" to ""good"" cholesterol.
Apo A-I may be ordered, along with other tests, when someone has undergone lipid-lowering treatment or lifestyle changes, such as decreased dietary fat and increased regular exercise, to monitor the effectiveness of the changes.



","



Low levels of apo A-I are usually associated with low levels of HDL and impaired clearance of excess cholesterol from the body. Low levels of apo A-I, along with high concentrations of apo B, are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. High levels of apo A-I is considered protective and can be independent of HDL levels.
There are some genetic disorders that lead to deficiencies in apo A-I (and therefore to low levels of HDL). People with these disorders tend to have abnormal lipid levels, including high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL – the ""bad"" cholesterol). Frequently, they have accelerated rates of atherosclerosis. These genetic disorders are primary causes of low apo A-I.
Changes in levels of apo A-I may also be associated with other factors. Some of the conditions that contribute to decreases or increases in apo A-I are listed below.
Apo A-I may decrease with:

Chronic kidney disease
Use of drugs such as: androgens, beta blockers, diuretics, and progestins (synthetic progesterone)
Smoking
Uncontrolled diabetes
Obesity

Apo A-I may increase with:

Use of drugs such as: carbamazepine, estrogens, ethanol, lovastatin, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenobarbital, pravastatin, and simvastatin
Physical exercise
Pregnancy
Weight reduction
Use of statins




","



The concentration of apo A-I reflects the amount of HDL in the serum. Since women tend to have higher HDL, they also have higher levels of apo A-I.
The apo A-I test is not routinely ordered. Healthcare practitioners still have to determine the best uses for the apo A-I and other tests for emerging cardiac risk markers (such as apo B, hs-CRP, and Lp(a)). They offer additional information in specific situations but are not meant to replace the lipid tests already routinely available.



",,"



Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) may be ordered, along with other lipid tests, as part of a profile to help determine a person's risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). It may be used as an alternative to a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) test, but it is not generally considered ""better"" or more informative than HDL and is not ordered routinely.
Apo A-I is a protein that has a specific role in the metabolism of lipids and is the main protein component in HDL, the ""good cholesterol"". HDL removes excess cholesterol from cells and takes it to the liver for recycling or disposal. Levels of apo A-I tend to rise and fall with HDL levels, and deficiencies in apo A-I correlate with an increased risk of developing CVD.
An apo A-I test may sometimes be ordered to:

Help diagnose inherited or acquired conditions that cause apo A-I deficiencies
Help evaluate people who have a personal or family history of heart disease and/or high cholesterol and triglycerides or low HDL
Monitor the effectiveness of lifestyle changes and lipid treatments

An apo A-I may be ordered along with an apolipoprotein B (apo B) test to determine an apo B/apo A-I ratio. This ratio is sometimes used as an alternative to a total cholesterol/HDL ratio (sometimes reported as part of a lipid profile) to evaluate risk for developing CVD.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or cerebrospinal fluid collected from a spinal tap


","



Arboviruses (arthropod-borne virus) cause viral infections that are transmitted between humans by mosquitoes and other blood-sucking insects, such as ticks. Arbovirus testing detects either antibodies produced by the body's immune system in response to a specific arbovirus infection or it detects the virus's genetic material in blood or cerebrospinal fluid.
Found throughout the world, arboviruses are an important cause of viral meningitis and encephalitis. In temperate climates, they tend to cause occasional seasonal epidemics. In tropical climates, they may be found year-round, whenever mosquitoes are active.
These viruses are spread when a mosquito, or sometimes another insect carrier (vector) such as a tick or sandfly, bites an infected bird or other small animal and becomes infected, then bites a human and passes it on. Arbovirus infections are usually not directly passed from person-to-person. Sometimes, an infection may be transmitted through a blood transfusion, organ transplant, sexual contact, from a pregnant woman to her baby, or from a mother to child through breast milk.
Arbovirus testing is used along with a person's signs, symptoms, and history of exposure and travel to detect and confirm an acute arbovirus infection and to distinguish between an infection and other conditions that may cause similar symptoms.
Depending on the virus causing the infection, people infected by an arbovirus may have only mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that resolve within a few days to a few weeks. In some cases, a sudden onset of high fever may be accompanied by a rash (dengue fever), jaundice (yellow fever), or severe joint pain and debilitating symptoms. Depending on the virus, a person may develop severe symptoms that may be life-threatening and require hospitalization.
There are hundreds of different arboviruses, but most are not common. Examples of arboviruses include:

When you have symptoms suggesting an arbovirus infection, such as fever, headache, stiff neck, muscular weakness and a diagnosis of encephalitis and/or meningitis


","



Testing is primarily ordered when a person has signs and symptoms suggesting a current arbovirus infection, especially if the person lives in or has recently traveled to an area where a specific arbovirus is endemic.
In the U.S., an arbovirus infection may be suspected when symptoms arise during mid to late summer. In warmer areas, infections may occur year-round.
Some signs and symptoms may include:

Fever
Headache
Muscle weakness and pain
Joint pain
Nausea
Skin rash

A small percentage of people, especially the young, elderly, and immunocompromised, may have more serious symptoms associated with meningitis and encephalitis. These symptoms may include:

High fever
Severe headaches
Convulsions
Confusion
Stiff neck
Muscular paralysis

Antibody tests may be ordered within the first week or two of the onset of symptoms to detect an acute infection. An additional blood sample may be collected 2 to 4 weeks later to determine if the antibody level is rising. When an infection of the central nervous system is suspected, antibody testing may be performed on cerebrospinal fluid as well as blood.



","



Results of arbovirus testing require careful interpretation, taking into consideration the individual's signs and symptoms as well as risk of exposure.
Antibody Tests
Antibody tests may be reported as positive or negative, or may be reported as less than or greater than a certain titer. For example, if the established threshold is a titer of 1:10, then a result less than this is considered negative while a titer greater than this is considered positive.
If IgM or IgG antibody is detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), it suggests that an arbovirus infection is present in the central nervous system. If a CSF antibody test is negative, then it suggests that there is no central nervous system involvement or the level of antibody is too low to detect.
If IgM and IgG arbovirus antibodies are detected in an initial blood sample, then it is likely that the person became infected with the arbovirus within the last few weeks. If the IgG is positive but the IgM is low or negative, then it is likely that the person had an arbovirus infection sometime in the past. If the arbovirus IgG antibody titer increases four-fold between an initial sample and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later, then it is likely that a person has had a recent infection.
Negative results for IgM and/or IgG antibodies may suggest that symptoms are due to a different cause, such as bacterial meningitis. However, the person may still have an arbovirus infection – it may just be that it is too soon after initial exposure to the virus and there has not been enough time to produce a detectable level of antibody. If suspicion of arbovirus remains high, antibody testing may be repeated at a later time or a NAAT test may be done as follow up.
The following table summarizes results that may be seen with antibody testing:



IgM Result
IgG Result
Possible Interpretation


Positive
Negative
Current infection


Positive
Positive
Recent infection


Low or negative or not tested
Four-fold increase in samples taken 2-4 weeks apart
Recent infection


Low or negative
Positive
Past infection


Negative
Negative


Too soon after initial exposure for antibodies to develop
Symptoms due to another cause





A positive result on an initial test for IgM arbovirus antibody in blood or CSF is considered a presumptive positive since antibodies to viruses in the same family may cross-react. It suggests a diagnosis, but it is not definitive. A positive result on a second test using a different method (NAAT or neutralization assay) confirms the diagnosis.
Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT)
A positive NAAT for an arbovirus indicates infection with that specific virus.
A negative NAAT means there is no virus present in the sample tested or the virus is present in very low (undetectable) numbers. A negative test cannot be used to definitely rule out the presence of an arbovirus.



","



The presence of arbovirus antibodies may indicate an infection but cannot be used to predict the severity of an individual's symptoms or the person's prognosis.
Other tests, such as antigen tests for dengue fever and viral cultures, may be used in some instances. NAAT and viral cultures may be used in research settings and by the medical community at a national and international level to identify and study the strains of arboviruses causing infections. Different strains have been isolated and associated with regional epidemics.
Molecular tests such as NAAT may be performed at a public health laboratory or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They may be done before a diagnosis is established and officially reported to the CDC.
NAAT testing is now routinely used in the U.S. to screen units of donated blood for West Nile Virus and for Zika virus and may be performed on the blood of tissue and organ donors prior to transplantation. It may be used to test the tissues of a person who has died (post mortem) to determine whether a specific arbovirus may have caused or contributed to the person's death.
Arbovirus testing can also be performed on suspected host animals and mosquito pools to detect the presence and spread of an arbovirus in the community and region. This information can be used to help investigate outbreaks, identify and monitor infection sources, and to guide efforts to prevent the spread of the infection.



",,"



Arbovirus testing is used to determine whether a person with signs and symptoms and a recent history of potential exposure to a specific arbovirus has been infected. Testing can help diagnose the cause of meningitis or encephalitis, distinguish an arbovirus infection from other conditions causing similar symptoms, such as bacterial meningitis, and can help guide treatment.
Typically, the individual test ordered is specific for a particular arbovirus, such as West Nile Virus (WNV) or dengue fever, depending on the person's symptoms and likely exposure. Sometimes, a panel of tests may be used to determine which arbovirus is causing the infection.
Two types of tests are available:
Antibody Tests
Antibody testing detects specific arbovirus antibodies produced in response to an infection. There are two classes of antibodies that may be tested:

IgM antibodies are produced first and are present within a week or two after infection. Levels in the blood rise for a few weeks, then taper off. After a few months, IgM antibodies fall below detectable levels. IgM antibody testing is the primary test performed on the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of symptomatic people.
IgG antibodies are produced after IgM antibodies. Typically, the level rises with an acute infection, stabilizes, and then persists long-term. IgG tests may be ordered along with IgM testing to help diagnose a recent or previous arbovirus infection. Sometimes testing is done by collecting two samples 2 to 4 weeks apart (acute and convalescent samples) and measuring the IgG level (titer). This may help determine whether antibodies are from a recent or past infection.

Antibody tests may cross-react with viruses that are similar, so a second test that employs a different method, such as nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) or a neutralization assay, may be used to confirm positive results.
Nucleic Acid Amplification Test
A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) amplifies and measures the arbovirus's genetic material to detect the presence of the virus. It can detect a current infection with the virus, often before antibodies to the virus are detectable, but there must be a certain amount of virus present in the sample in order to detect it. For most arboviruses, virus levels in humans are usually low and do not persist for very long.

To detect liver damage and/or to help diagnose liver disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme found in cells throughout the body but mostly in the heart and liver and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys and muscles. In healthy individuals, levels of AST in the blood are low. When liver or muscle cells are injured, they release AST into the blood. This makes AST a useful test for detecting or monitoring liver damage or related infections and some side effects of medications.
The liver is a vital organ located in the upper right-hand side of the abdominal area just beneath the rib cage. It is involved in many important functions in the body. The liver helps to process the body's nutrients, manufactures bile to help digest fats, produces many important proteins such as blood clotting factors, and breaks down potentially toxic substances into harmless ones that the body can use or excrete. It also helps metabolize some medications.
A number of conditions can cause injury to the liver and may cause increases in AST. The test is most useful in detecting liver damage due to hepatitis, drugs toxic to the liver, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. AST, however, is not specific for the liver and may be increased in conditions affecting other parts of the body.
An AST test is often performed along with an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test. Both are enzymes found in the liver that become elevated in the blood when the liver is damaged. A calculated AST/ALT ratio is useful for differentiating between different causes of liver injury and in recognizing when the increased levels may be coming from another source, such as heart or muscle injury.

AST may be ordered as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) when you have a routine health examination.
A healthcare practitioner may order an AST test along with several other tests when you have signs and symptoms of a liver disorder. Some of these may include:

Weakness, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Abdominal swelling and/or pain
Jaundice
Dark urine, light-colored stool
Itching (pruritus)
Swelling in the legs and ankles
Tendency to bruise easily

AST may also be ordered, either by itself or with other tests, when you are at an increased risk for liver disease since many people with mild liver damage will have no signs or symptoms. You may be at increased risk if you:

Have been exposed to hepatitis viruses
Are a heavy drinker
Have a history of liver disease in your family
Are taking drugs that can damage the liver
Are overweight and/or have diabetes

When AST is used to monitor treatment of persons with liver disease, it may be ordered on a regular basis during the course of treatment to determine whether the therapy is effective.



","



Low levels of AST in the blood are expected and are normal.
Very high levels of AST (more than 10 times normal) are usually due to acute hepatitis, sometimes due to a viral infection. In acute hepatitis, AST levels usually stay high for about 1-2 months but can take as long as 3-6 months to return to normal. Levels of AST may also be markedly elevated (often over 100 times normal) as a result of exposure to drugs or other substances that are toxic to the liver as well as in conditions that cause decreased blood flow (ischemia) to the liver.
With chronic hepatitis, AST levels are usually not as high, often less than 4 times normal, and are more likely to be normal than are ALT levels. AST often varies between normal and slightly increased with chronic hepatitis, so the test may be ordered frequently to determine the pattern. Such moderate increases may also be seen in other diseases of the liver, especially when the bile ducts are blocked, or with cirrhosis or certain cancers of the liver. AST may also increase after heart attacks and with muscle injury, usually to a much greater degree than ALT.
AST is often performed together with the ALT test or as part of a liver panel. For more about AST results in relation to other liver tests, see the Liver Panel article.
In most types of liver disease, the ALT level is higher than AST and the AST/ALT ratio will be low (less than 1). There are a few exceptions; the AST/ALT ratio is usually increased in alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease, and in the first day or two of acute hepatitis or injury from bile duct obstruction. With heart or muscle injury, AST is often much higher than ALT (often 3-5 times as high) and levels tend to stay higher than ALT for longer than with liver injury.



","



Pregnancy, a shot or injection of medicine into muscle tissue, or even strenuous exercise may increase AST levels. Acute burns, surgery, and seizures may raise AST levels as well.
In rare instances, some drugs can damage the liver or muscle, increasing AST levels. This is true of both prescription drugs and some ""natural"" health products. Be sure to tell your healthcare practitioner about all of the drugs and/or health supplements that you are taking.



","



The blood test for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is usually used to detect liver damage and liver infections. It is often ordered in conjunction with another liver enzyme, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or as part of a liver panel or comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to screen for and/or help diagnose liver disorders.
AST and ALT are considered to be two of the most important tests to detect liver injury, although ALT is more specific for the liver than is AST and is more commonly increased than is AST. Sometimes AST is compared directly to ALT and an AST/ALT ratio is calculated. This ratio may be used to distinguish between different causes of liver damage and to distinguish liver injury from damage to heart or muscle.
AST levels are often compared with results of other tests such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total protein, and bilirubin to help determine which form of liver disease is present.
AST is often measured to monitor treatment of liver disease and may be ordered either by itself or along with other tests for this purpose.
Sometimes AST may be used to monitor people who are taking medications that are potentially toxic to the liver. If AST levels increase, then the person may be switched to another medication.

To detect and identify the bacteria causing an infection of your wound and to help guide treatment of your wound infection


","

A sterile swab may be used to collect cells or pus from a superficial wound site. From deeper wounds, aspirations of fluid into a syringe and/or a tissue biopsy are the optimal specimens to allow for the recovery of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.


","



A bacterial wound culture is a test that detects and identifies bacteria that cause infections (pathogenic) in a wound. Any wound may become infected with a variety of bacteria. A culture helps to determine whether a wound has become infected, which type(s) of bacteria are causing the infection, and which antibiotic would best treat the infection and help heal the wound.
Wounds may be superficial breaks in the skin such as scrapes, cuts and scratches or may involve deeper tissues such as incisions, bites, punctures or burns. (Read the article on Wound and Skin Infections.) A culture is performed by collecting a sample of fluid, cells or tissue from the wound and placing it on or in appropriate nutrient media. The media encourages the growth of bacteria that may be present, allowing for further testing and identification.
Typically, only one kind of pathogenic bacteria is causing the infection in a wound. However, there may be several types of normal skin bacteria present in the culture. Separating the various types of bacteria and identifying the pathogenic bacteria requires one or more days to perform.
A Gram stain is usually performed to help determine the type of bacteria present and provide a rapid result to the healthcare practitioner. The shape and color (morphology and staining characteristics) also help determine what other tests may need to be performed to definitively identify the cause of infection.
Because the results of the stain read under the microscope are not definitive, further tests such as biochemical reactions or mass spectrometry must be performed to identify the bacteria. Mass spectrometry using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) can provide an identification to the genus and species level in less than an hour after the bacterial colony is grown on the culture media. This technique significantly decreases the time needed to identify bacteria from traditional biochemical reactions that require overnight incubation.
For many of the pathogens identified in wound cultures, testing is done to determine which antibiotics will be effective in inhibiting the growth of the bacteria (see Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing). The Gram stain of the wound, the culture, and susceptibility testing all contribute to inform the healthcare practitioner which pathogen(s) are present and what antibiotic therapy is likely to inhibit their growth.

A wound that is slow to heal
Heat, redness and swelling at the site
Tenderness at the site
Drainage of fluid or pus
Fever

It may also occasionally be ordered after a person has been treated for a wound infection to evaluate the treatment's effectiveness and may be ordered when indicated to help guide the treatment of a chronic wound infection.



","



Laboratory reports for cultures typically name the bacteria identified during the test. A negative culture will usually be reported, for example, as ""no growth seen in 5 days"" or note the presence of normal skin flora only.
If pathogenic bacteria are identified in the culture, then it is likely that they are the source of the infection. An infection is typically caused by a single type of bacteria, but wounds may have two or more pathogens (aerobes and/or anaerobes) that are contributing to the infection.
If more than three organisms are present, they may not be identified as individual bacterial species and the report may refer to them as ""mixed bacterial flora."" This may indicate a mixture of normal flora found on the skin and potential pathogens cultured from a wound site that was not cleansed properly before the specimen was taken or from a ""dirty wound"" such as a motorcycle accident, where material from the road is contaminating the wound.
If there is only normal flora present, then the infection may be due to bacteria normally found on the skin, or the pathogen may have been missed in the sample due to low numbers present, or the infection may be due to another cause.
Very little growth may still be significant, especially when the wound infection is in an area of the body considered to be essentially sterile, such as the eye.
If there are no bacteria recovered in the wound specimen, then there may not be a bacterial infection, or the pathogen was not successfully recovered with the sample and test.



","



With burn wounds, the type and number of bacteria that grow are correlated to the severity of the infection. When burn tissue specimens have a specific bacterial count above a certain number, then removal of dead tissue (debridement) may be indicated.
Wound culture results may be less predictive of what is causing the infection when a person has already been treated with antibiotics or when a person has a chronic infection.
Typically, if an infection has spread from a wound into the blood and other organs, then the same bacteria or yeast may be detected in the person's blood cultures.



",,"



A bacterial wound culture is primarily used, along with a Gram stain and other tests, to help determine whether a wound is infected and to identify the bacteria causing the infection.
If a culture reveals that a wound is infected, susceptibility testing is done to determine which antibiotic will inhibit the growth of the bacteria causing the infection. This is often performed automatically as part of the original order on the wound specimen so that antimicrobial susceptibility results can guide appropriate therapy as soon as possible.
A wound culture may also sometimes be ordered for an individual who has undergone treatment for a wound infection to determine whether the treatment was effective. It may also be ordered at intervals for a person who has a chronic infection to help guide further treatment.
If a fungal infection is suspected, then a fungal culture of the wound specimen may be ordered along with the bacterial wound culture. Yeast and some fungi may grow on the same media as bacteria, but many fungi are slow-growing. The media used to recover fungi inhibits bacterial growth and supports fungal growth for several weeks.

The basic metabolic panel (BMP) is a group of 8 tests that measures several substances in your blood. It is one of the most commonly ordered lab tests.
The BMP gives your healthcare practitioner important information about the current status of your body’s metabolism (hence the name metabolic panel). The BMP provides information on your blood sugar (glucose) level, the balance of electrolytes and fluids, and the health of your kidneys. Abnormal results, and especially combinations of abnormal results, can indicate a problem that needs to be addressed and may require additional testing.
The BMP includes the following tests:

Glucose – the primary energy source for the body's cells; a steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively stable level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.
Calcium – one of the most important minerals in the body; it is essential for the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart and is required in blood clotting and in the formation of bones.

Electrolytes—these are minerals found in body tissues and blood in the form of dissolved salts. Electrolytes help move nutrients into the body's cells and remove wastes out of cells. They help maintain a healthy water balance and help stabilize the body's acid/base (pH) level. The following 4 tests are commonly called electrolytes:

Sodium – vital to normal body function, including nerve and muscle function
Potassium – vital to cell metabolism and muscle function, helping to transmit messages between nerves and muscles
Bicarbonate (Total CO2) – helps to maintain the body's acid-base balance (pH)
Chloride – helps to regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance

Kidney Tests

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) – waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys; as kidney function decreases, BUN level rises.
Creatinine – waste product produced in the muscles; it is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys so blood levels are a good indication of how well the kidneys are working.

A BMP may be ordered when you have a routine health exam. The panel is also often ordered when you are ill, in the hospital, or in the emergency room. It may be ordered at regular intervals when you have an ongoing or long-term condition that is being monitored.



","



Results of the tests that are part of the BMP are typically evaluated together to look for patterns of results. A single abnormal test result may mean something different than if several test results are abnormal.
Results that are out of range on any of the tests included in the BMP can be due to a variety of different conditions, including kidney disease, breathing problems, and complications related to diabetes. Typically, if any results are out of range, one or more follow-up tests are performed to help pinpoint the cause and/or help establish a diagnosis.

To help diagnose a B-cell lymphoma; to detect and evaluate residual cancer cells


","

A bone marrow or other tissue biopsy procedure is performed by a doctor or other trained specialist. Body fluid samples are obtained by inserting a needle into the body cavity and withdrawing a portion of the fluid with a syringe. Sometimes, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.


","



This test detects characteristic changes (rearrangements) in specific genes in B-cells. This information can be helpful in diagnosing a B-cell lymphoma.
B-cells are a type of lymphocyte (a kind of white blood cell, WBC) that produces antibodies in response to infections or other ""foreign invaders."" Rearrangements in certain parts of their DNA called immunoglobulin genes are a normal part of their development. These rearrangements are associated with the development of a large repertoire of diverse B-cells, allowing them to protect against many different kinds of infections. The final order in which the genes are rearranged is called a gene rearrangement profile. Within any normal population (sample) of B cells, the cells and their gene rearrangement profiles are very diverse.
In a B-cell lymphoma, the lymphoma cells are virtually identical and their gene rearrangement profiles are likewise identical. Lymphomas arise when an abnormal B cell begins to produce numerous identical copies of itself (clones). The cloned cells grow and divide uncontrollably, crowding out normal cells.
A B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement test evaluates the cells in a person's sample to determine whether the majority of B-cell rearrangement profiles are diverse or identical. This information, along with clinical signs and symptoms and results of other laboratory tests, can help clarify a person's diagnosis, or evaluate the persistence or recurrence of lymphoma.
About 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the U.S. are B-cell lymphomas, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS).
For additional details about B-cells and this testing, see Common Questions below.

When a healthcare practitioner thinks that you may have a B-cell lymphoma; sometimes to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or to evaluate for recurrent disease


","



Testing is performed when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest a lymphoma, such as:

One or more swollen but painless lymph nodes—depending on the site of the affected lymph node, symptoms may involve areas of the chest, armpit, neck, abdomen, or groin area, for example
Fatigue
Fever
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Neurologic symptoms that may suggest central nervous system involvement

Findings from a CBC and differential may be the first indication that a person might have a blood cell cancer as symptoms of early lymphoma may be absent, mild, or nonspecific.
Testing may be done when other laboratory tests indicate that a lymphoma may be present and/or when other tests are inconclusive. Some examples include:

An increased number of lymphocytes, especially abnormal-looking lymphocytes, as determined with a CBC and a blood smear examination
Signs of lymphoma in a tissue biopsy, body fluid or bone marrow sample
With immunophenotyping (e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry), antigen groupings that are inconclusive for a B-cell lymphoma, or when the doctor wants to confirm a diagnosis of lymphoma based on histopathology and immunophenotyping

Testing may also be ordered when a person has been treated for a lymphoma to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment, that is, to detect residual or recurrent disease.



","



Results of testing are typically interpreted by a doctor who specializes in pathology, in particular, pathology dealing with blood, blood cells, and bone marrow cells (hematopathology). Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, other test results including pathology immunophenotyping information, an understanding of the strengths and limitations of different testing methods, and with an understanding of the range of findings in a ""normal"" lymphocyte cell population.
In general, if a significant clonal B-cell population is detected and other associated tests are in agreement, then it is likely that the individual tested has a B-cell lymphoma.
Examples of lymphomas that may be detected by gene rearrangement testing include:

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma
Burkitt lymphoma
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma
Hairy cell leukemia
Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia
Mantle cell lymphoma
Marginal zone lymphoma

A negative result on this test does not necessarily rule out a lymphoma. A person can be negative for a clonal B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement but may still have lymphoma. A test may also be negative if the test method is not sensitive enough to detect the rearrangement, or if the clonal lymphocytes from the person tested have mutations that are not detected by the test.



","



According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is one of the most common cancers in the United States. ACS estimates that about 72,240 people will be diagnosed with NHL in 2017 and as many as 20,140 will die of it.
Sample collection and testing may need to be repeated when the initial sample does not contain enough DNA to test.
The detection of a clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement is not synonymous with the presence of B-cell lymphoma. An individual may have a clonal B-cell population and not have cancer. Conditions such as autoimmune disorders, immune suppression, and immune deficiencies are sometimes associated with small clonal B-cell populations. This means that one or more groups of cloned B-cells may be present in a person's lymphocyte population without it being considered a lymphoma.
Since false positive and false negative results can be associated with this testing, the results must be interpreted in the context of other clinical and pathologic findings.
Since plasma cells are terminally differentiated B cells, immunoglobulin gene rearrangement testing can also be seen in plasma cell neoplasms, such as multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma.



",,"



B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement tests are used to help diagnose non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and evaluate for residual or recurrent disease after treatment.
There are many different types of B-cell lymphoma and each has different characteristics, prognoses, and a likely response to therapy. Several classification systems have been used to describe them. The most recent is the World Health Organization's (for more on this, see the Lymphoma article).
Testing for B-cell lymphomas involves several types of tests:

Complete Blood Count (CBC) and a WBC differential to evaluate the number, types, and maturity of white blood cells present in the blood. Results may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes and/or presence of abnormal lymphocytes.
Pathology evaluation of blood smear, bone marrow, lymph node and/or other tissue biopsy samples. These samples are examined under a microscope by a trained laboratorian, usually a pathologist.
If indicated, immunophenotyping is performed on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue (e.g., enlarged lymph node, tumor). This test detects the presence or absence of certain markers on the membrane of the cells or inside the cells. These commonly used markers are called clusters of differentiation (CD) and are listed numerically. Patterns of antigens (presence or absence) can provide information as to whether the B cells are clones (monoclonal) and can further help classify a B-cell lymphoma.

An excess of B cells can be benign or malignant. If, at this point, there is still no conclusion whether a person has a benign or malignant lymphocyte population, B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement testing can be performed.
This testing may also sometimes be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of lymphoma treatment, that is, to detect residual or recurrent disease, the continued presence of abnormal monoclonal B cells.

To help diagnose and monitor the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and a type of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein or a bone marrow sample collected using a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy procedure


","



BCR-ABL1 refers to a gene sequence found in an abnormal chromosome 22 of some people with certain forms of leukemia. Unlike most cancers, the cause of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and some other leukemias can be traced to a single, specific genetic abnormality in one chromosome. The presence of the gene sequence known as BCR-ABL1 confirms the diagnosis of CML and a form of acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL), specifically a type of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. In very rare cases, the abnormal chromosome is linked to cases of acute myeloid leukemia and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma.
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes containing inherited genetic information. Those genes contain the blueprints, in the form of DNA, for producing the proteins that our bodies rely on to function properly. While some genetic abnormalities are inherited, they can also come from changes that occur to genes or chromosomes after a person is born. This can happen through exposure to various environmental factors (e.g., radiation, certain chemicals) but more often for unknown reasons.
The BCR-ABL1 gene sequence is one such acquired change that is formed when pieces of chromosome 9 and chromosome 22 break off and switch places. When this occurs, the ABL1 region in chromosome 9 fuses with the BCR gene region in chromosome 22. This type of change is called a reciprocal translocation and is often abbreviated as t(9;22). The resulting chromosome 22 that has the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence is known as the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome because that is where it was first discovered.
The resulting Philadelphia chromosome contains an abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that encodes an abnormal protein that is responsible for the development of CML and a type of ALL. At diagnosis, 90-95% of cases of CML show a characteristic t(9;22) BCR-ABL1 reciprocal chromosomal translocation. About 30% of adults with B-ALL have the translocation, while it is only present in about 2 to 4% of cases in children.
The protein coded for by the abnormal BCR-ABL1 fusion gene is a type of enzyme called a tyrosine kinase. That enzyme is responsible for the uncontrolled growth of leukemic cells. When large numbers of abnormal leukemic cells start to crowd out the normal blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, signs and symptoms of leukemia start to emerge. Treatment of these leukemias typically involves a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Testing for BCR-ABL1 detects the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR-ABL1 fusion gene or its transcripts, which are the RNA copies made by the cell from the abnormal stretches of DNA. The presence of the BCR-ABL1 abnormality confirms the clinical diagnosis of CML, a type of ALL, and rarely acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
There are several different types of BCR-ABL1 tests available, including:

Cytogenetics (chromosome analysis or karyotyping)
	This test looks at chromosomes under a microscope to detect structural and/or numerical abnormalities. For example, the Philadelphia chromosome is a small abnormal version of chromosome 22 resulting from the exchange or translocation of material between chromosome 9 and chromosome 22. Cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are grown in the laboratory and then examined to determine if the Philadelphia chromosome is present. Other chromosomal abnormalities can also be detected.
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
	This test method uses fluorescent dye-labeled probes to ""light up"" the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence when it is present. Test results for FISH are often available more quickly than for conventional chromosome analysis.
Genetic molecular testing (qualitative or quantitative)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based qualitative and quantitative tests detect and measure the BCR-ABL1 RNA transcripts in leukemia cells taken from blood or bone marrow samples. This test can detect very small amounts of BCR-ABL, even when the Philadelphia chromosome isn’t seen in bone marrow cells by less sensitive but important techniques like chromosome analysis or FISH.
Secondary mutations within BCR-ABL1 are known to cause resistance to therapy. These can be detected by DNA sequencing methods.

When you have results of a complete blood count (CBC) and/or signs and symptoms that suggest that you may have leukemia; periodically when you are being treated for CML or BCR-ABL1-positive ALL


","



BCR-ABL1 testing is ordered when a health practitioner suspects that a person has CML or Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive ALL. Initial testing may be indicated when a person has nonspecific signs or symptoms such as:

Fatigue
Weight loss
Joint or bone pain
Enlarged spleen
Night sweats
Fever
As follow-up to abnormal findings on a complete blood count (CBC)

Early in the disease, a person may have few or no symptoms. As time passes and normal blood cells are crowded out of the bone marrow and the number of abnormal leukemic cells increases, a person may experience anemia, prolonged bleeding, and recurrent infections.
Once CML or Ph chromosome-positive ALL has been diagnosed, BCR-ABL1 quantitative genetic testing is ordered periodically (typically every 3 months) to monitor the response to treatment and monitor for recurrence.
When a person is not responding and treatment resistance is suspected or disease recurrence occurs after remission, BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation analysis may be performed.



","



An interpretation of test results is typically done by a healthcare practitioner with specialized training and provided with the report.
If a person has abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow and has the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and BCR-ABL1 gene sequence, then the individual is diagnosed with CML or Ph-positive ALL.
Of those who have CML, 90-95% have the Ph chromosome if tested by cytogenetics and 100% have the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence by FISH and/or qualitative BCR-ABL1 molecular testing. About 30% of adults with B-ALL and 2-4% of children with B-ALL are positive for the Ph chromosome and/or the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence.
A small percentage of people with CML will have the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence but not the Ph chromosome. These cases either have variant translocations that involve a third or even a fourth chromosome in addition to 9 and 22 or have a hidden translocation involving 9 and 22 that can not be identified by routine chromosomal analysis. Since the treatment for BCR-ABL1-related leukemias specifically targets the tyrosine kinase protein produced, these people can still be monitored with quantitative BCR-ABL1 molecular testing.
Very rarely, neither the Ph chromosome nor the BCR-ABL1 mutation can be found in people who seem to have CML. These people are considered to not truly have CML and might have unknown mutations causing the disease.
In general, if the amount of BCR-ABL1 in the blood or bone marrow decreases over time, then the person is responding to treatment. If the quantity of BCR-ABL1 drops below the test's detection level and the person's blood cell counts are normal, then the person is considered to be in remission.
Treatment response is frequently dramatic and long-lasting with imatinib, the first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but 30 to 40% of patients will need further treatment at some point. For many people, this is caused by the acquisition of point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene. This leaves the protein insensitive to imatinib's inhibitory effects.
If the BCR-ABL1 level rises, then it indicates disease progression or recurrence and it may also indicate that the person has become resistant to imatinib. Additional genetic testing is often performed to detect the development of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations associated with imatinib resistance.
If an individual's leukemia is resistant to imatinib, a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be given. Those tyrosine kinase inhibitors, developed after imatinib, are also given in case the side effects from imatinib are too severe or in case of a rare BCR-ABL mutation. They include ponatib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib.
If a person with ALL is not positive for the Ph chromosome and the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence, then that person will not be given a tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug and BCR-ABL1 molecular testing cannot be used to monitor the person.



","



Recognition of disease progression and transformation is important for prognosis and treatment. CML can go through three phases:

Chronic phase—most people with CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase, which usually has an insidious onset, meaning that leukemia symptoms may be absent or subtle. Patients have less than 10% immature blood cells (blasts) in blood or bone marrow samples.The chronic phase may last for a month to several years. This is the phase when there are few or no symptoms and also the time period when treatment is most successful.
Accelerated phase—changes include but are not limited to increasing white blood cell (WBC) counts despite or unresponsive to therapy and additional changes to cells like an increase in blasts in blood and/or bone marrow (10-19% blasts), or additional chromosome abnormalities beyond the Philadelphia chromosome
Blast phase—when blasts are 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow or when there is blast proliferation outside the bone marrow

Both blood and bone marrow are often evaluated as part of the initial diagnosis, but the majority of follow-up monitoring is performed on blood samples.
There is significant test variability among laboratories using different test platforms. Therefore, for a given patient, the quantitative BCR-ABL1 molecular testing should be performed by the same laboratory or referred to a laboratory that follows universal reporting criteria. Rising and falling levels of BCR-ABL1 are usually more important than a single test result.



","



BCR-ABL1 testing is used to:

Help diagnose some forms of leukemia, i.e., chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or a type of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and, rarely, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which the BCR-ABL1 gene sequence is present (BCR-ABL1-positive).
Monitor treatment
Monitor for recurrence
Detect resistance to therapy

BCR-ABL1 testing is ordered to detect the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and BCR-ABL1 gene sequence. Several types of tests may be ordered to detect BCR-ABL1. These include chromosome analysis, BCR-ABL1 molecular genetic test, and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). These help establish the initial diagnosis of CML or Ph-positive ALL. The quantitative test is also used to monitor how well someone responds to therapy.
Tests for BCR-ABL1 are often performed along with other tests if a health practitioner suspects that someone has leukemia and is trying to diagnose or rule out CML and Ph-positive ALL. 
The BCR-ABL1 can produce proteins of differing sizes and weights, depending on where the break in chromosome 22 occurred. In CML, the breakpoint in BCR is almost always in the major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR), leading to the production of BCR-ABL1 protein of a larger size (the protein is called p210). Breaks in the minor breakpoint cluster region (m-BCR) leads to a shorter fusion protein (called p190), which is most frequently associated with Ph chromosome-positive ALL.
The quantitative BCR-ABL1 molecular test measures either of the breakpoints in the fusion gene. It is used to establish a baseline value and then to monitor the person's response to treatment and, if the person achieves remission, to monitor for recurrence. If treatment resistance or disease recurrence occurs, the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation analysis should be performed to guide further treatment.

Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody is an autoantibody that is associated with inappropriate blood clotting. This test detects and measures beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies in the blood.
Beta-2 glycoprotein antibody is considered one of the primary autoantibodies called antiphospholipid antibodies that mistakenly target the body's own lipid-proteins (phospholipids) found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. This test is often ordered along with tests for other antiphospholipid antibodies, including cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant.
Antiphospholipid antibodies interfere with the body's blood clotting process in a way that is not fully understood yet. They increase the risk of developing inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in both arteries and veins.
Antiphospholipid antibodies most frequently develop in people with the autoimmune disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). This condition is associated with widespread blood clots (thrombotic episodes), a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), or with pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and recurrent miscarriages, especially in the second and third trimesters.
Also, some people with autoimmune disorders such as lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE) may begin to produce one or more of these autoantibodies, which can put them at risk of forming blood clots in blood vessels.

This testing may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of excessive clotting or antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), such as:

A blood clot in a blood vessel, for example, deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Stroke or transient ischemic attacks (also known as TIA or ""mini strokes"")
Repeated miscarriages or pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia

This test may sometime be done when you have been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and your healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether you have developed the autoantibody.



","



Your healthcare practitioner will consider the results of your tests along with other factors, such as medical history, physical exam, and signs and symptoms.
A positive beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody test may indicate that you have antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), as they are most frequently seen with this condition. If the test is positive, it will be repeated about 12 weeks later to determine whether it is persistent or temporary.
Currently, healthcare practitioners diagnose APS based on both clinical findings and the persistent presence of one or more antiphospholipid antibodies. A high level of beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody that is tested and confirmed as positive 12 weeks later means that it is likely that you have APS. This is especially true if other antiphospholipid antibody tests are positive.
If you are tested negative for beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies but positive for other antiphospholipid antibodies and have signs and symptoms, you likely have APS. If the test is weakly to moderately positive for beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies and weakly positive or negative for other antiphospholipid antibodies, it means the antibody may be due to a condition other than APS. If repeat testing is negative, then it is likely that the antibodies were temporary. These autoantibodies may be found temporarily in people with acute infections, HIV/AIDS, some cancers, or with use of drugs such as phenytoin, penicillin, and procainamide.
If you have an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), and test positive for beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies, you may have increased risk of developing a clot in a blood vessel. One or more antiphospholipid antibodies may be present with a variety of autoimmune disorders. (See the article on Autoimmune Diseases for a list of examples.) A person may also have co-existing autoimmune disorders, such as both APS and lupus.
If you have an autoimmune disorder and test negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, testing may be repeated at a later time to determine if you have started to produce them because they may develop at any time in the course of the disease.

Beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody tests are primarily used along with cardiolipin antibody and lupus anticoagulant testing to help diagnose:

Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
The cause of an unexplained blood clot (thrombotic episode)
The cause of recurrent miscarriages in women

Sometimes the test may be used to determine whether you have developed these autoantibodies if you have another autoimmune disorder, such as lupus.
Laboratory tests can detect three different classes of these autoantibodies: IgG, IgM, and IgA. If the initial antiphospholipid antibody tests for the IgG and IgM classes are negative but APS is still strongly suspected, then the IgA class of these antibodies may be tested, along with other less common antiphospholipid antibodies, such as anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-prothrombin.
However, the value of testing for the IgA class of antiphospholipid antibodies remains controversial. According to the international consensus statement on APS, the presence of the IgA class (either anticardiolipin antibodies or beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies) does not fulfill laboratory criteria for APS diagnosis.

Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is a protein that is found on the surface of nucleated cells (contain a nucleus) and functions as part of the human immune system. This protein is routinely shed by cells into the blood and is present in most body fluids, with highest levels in the blood, generally lower levels in spinal fluid, and trace levels in urine.
In the kidneys, B2M passes through blood-filtering units called the glomeruli and is then reabsorbed by the renal proximal tubules, structures that reclaim water, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other vital substances. Normally, only small amounts of B2M are present in the urine, but when the renal tubules become damaged or diseased, B2M concentrations increase due to the decreased ability to reabsorb this protein. When the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged, they are unable to filter out B2M, so the level in the blood rises.

","

When you have symptoms and signs associated with kidney dysfunction; periodically if you work with cadmium


","



Both blood and urine B2M tests may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms associated with kidney dysfunction and a health practitioner wants to distinguish between disorders that affect the glomeruli and the renal tubules. Some signs and symptoms may include:

Swelling or puffiness (edema), particularly around the eyes or in the face, wrists or ankles
Urine that is foamy, bloody, pink or brownish
Protein in the urine
Fatigue, weakness
Nausea

A urine test may also be ordered periodically to monitor a person who has had a kidney transplant or to monitor those exposed to high concentrations of cadmium or mercury to detect early kidney dysfunction.
People who have been on dialysis for five years or more may develop dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA), a condition resulting from the accumulation of excess B2M in the blood and eventually in the bone, joint, tendon (osteoarticular structure) and other body tissues such as heart, lung, and digestive tract. It is primarily diagnosed by tissue or bone biopsy. B2M levels are performed as part of the work-up in addition to imaging studies.



","



Levels of B2M in the blood vary from low levels to four times the lower limit, and this is considered normal. B2M may be undetectable in the urine.
Increased levels of B2M in the blood and urine indicate that there is a problem but are not diagnostic of a specific disease or condition.
In someone with signs of kidney disease, increased levels of B2M in the blood and low levels in the urine indicate that the disorder is associated with glomeruli dysfunction. If B2M is low in the blood and high in the urine, then it is likely that the person has renal tubule damage or disease. Also, B2M levels correlate with risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and with cause of death in patients with kidney disease or on dialysis.
In a person who has been on long-term dialysis, an increase in B2M is associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis.
Increases in urine B2M in a person with a kidney transplant may indicate early kidney rejection.
Increases in someone who is exposed to high levels of cadmium or mercury may indicate early kidney dysfunction.



","



Conditions associated with an increased rate of cell production or destruction, severe infections, viral infections such as CMV (cytomegalovirus), and some conditions that activate the immune system, such as inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders, can cause increases in beta-2 microglobulin levels, but the test is not typically ordered to monitor these conditions.
Drugs such as lithium, cyclosporine, cisplatin, carboplatin, gentamicin, interferon-α, and aminoglycoside antibiotics can increase B2M blood and/or urine concentrations.
Increases in blood and urine B2M can be seen with certain cancers, including multiple myeloma, leukemia, and lymphoma. When there is central nervous system involvement, increased B2M may also be found in the cerebrospinal fluid (see the Beta-2 Microglobulin Tumor Marker article). B2M may also be present in infectious and cerebrovascular disorders. In cases of HIV, an inverse correlation between B2M and CD4+ T-lymphocytes has been shown to mark disease progression.
B2M is increased in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Recent nuclear medicine procedures and radiographic contrast media can affect test results.
In people with kidney disease who are undergoing dialysis, B2M can form long protein chains that can be deposited in joints and tissues, causing stiffness and pain. This condition is called B2M dialysis-associated amyloidosis.



","



The beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) test may be used when known physical or suspected kidney damage occurs to distinguish between glomerular and tubular disorders of the kidney. B2M levels will also increase with disorders that involve overactive cell turnover and when the immune system is activated, thus is not diagnostic for a specific disease. With renal failure, it provides additional information about someone's likely prognosis and the health of their kidneys. B2M is measured in the following situations:

In kidney disease, both blood and urine B2M tests may be ordered along with other kidney function tests such as BUN, creatinine, and urine albumin (microalbumin) to evaluate kidney damage or disease and to distinguish between disorders that affect the glomeruli and the renal tubules.
Used to monitor persons with end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
Excess B2M can accumulate in joint spaces (synovitis) in long-term dialysis patients; this is called dialysis-related amyloidosis (DRA). A B2M test may be used to help evaluate a person for DRA.
B2M tests may sometimes be ordered to monitor people who have had a kidney transplant to detect early signs of rejection.
It may also be ordered to monitor people who are exposed to high levels of cadmium and/or other heavy metals like mercury, such as may occur with occupational exposure.

Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) is a protein that is found on the surface of almost all cells in the body and is shed by cells into the blood, particularly by B lymphocytes and tumor cells. It is present in most body fluids and its level rises with conditions that increase cell production and/or destruction, or that activate the immune system. This test measures B2M in the blood, urine, or rarely in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
B2M is frequently elevated in the blood with cancers such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma and with inflammatory disorders and infections (e.g., HIV, CMV). Because B2M is increased with blood cell cancers, it may be useful as a tumor marker. Though it can be used to assess kidney function, this article focuses on its use as a tumor marker.
The B2M level can be increased in the CSF of individuals with blood cell cancers that have spread (metastasized) to the brain, such as lymphoma, but also with some chronic disorders such as multiple sclerosis and with viral infections such as HIV.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. A 24-hour urine sample may also be collected. Rarely, a CSF sample may be collected from the lower back using a procedure called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

A CSF B2M may rarely be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a disease such as lymphoma is affecting someone's central nervous system.



","



Increased levels of B2M in the blood and/or urine indicate that there is a problem, but they are not diagnostic of a specific disease or condition. They do, however, reflect disease activity and the amount of cancer present. When someone has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma or lymphoma, that person is likely to have a poorer prognosis if the B2M level is significantly elevated.
For monitoring treatment, decreasing levels over time in someone with multiple myeloma indicate that the person is responding to treatment. Stable or increasing levels indicate that the person is not responding.
Increases in the CSF in someone with a disease such as HIV/AIDS indicate likely central nervous system involvement.
Low levels of B2M are considered normal. B2M may be undetectable in the urine and CSF.



","



Conditions associated with an increased rate of cell production or destruction, severe infections, viral infections such as CMV (cytomegalovirus), and some conditions that activate the immune system, such as inflammatory conditions and autoimmune disorders, can cause increases in B2M levels.
The kidneys filter wastes from the blood and reabsorb B2M. Because of this, only small amounts of B2M are normally present in the urine. If renal tubules in the kidneys become damaged or diseased, less is reabsorbed and concentrations of B2M in the urine increase (see the Beta-2 Microglobulin Kidney Disease test article).
Drugs such as lithium, cyclosporine, cisplatin, carboplatin, and aminoglycoside antibiotics can increase B2M blood and/or urine concentrations.
Recent nuclear medicine procedures and radiographic contrast media can affect test results.



",,"



This beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) test is used as a tumor marker for some people with blood cell cancers. It is not diagnostic for a specific disease, but it has been associated with the amount of cancer present (tumor burden) and can give a healthcare practitioner additional information about someone's likely prognosis.
A blood B2M test and sometimes a urine test may be ordered to help determine the severity and spread (stage) of multiple myeloma, to help evaluate the prognosis of cancers such as multiple myeloma and lymphoma, and may sometimes be ordered to evaluate disease activity and the effectiveness of treatment. Rarely, a CSF B2M test may be used to determine whether there is central nervous system involvement. The utility of CSF B2M in this circumstance remains unclear.
Elevated B2M in the blood is correlated with a larger amount of tumor (tumor mass) and reduced kidney function in multiple myeloma patients. Recently, the International Myeloma Working Group published new guidelines called the International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma. The staging system is based mainly off of levels of both albumin and B2M in the blood. Higher blood B2M levels correspond with higher disease stages and therefore more advanced disease with worse prognosis.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Bicarbonate is an electrolyte, a negatively charged ion that is used by the body to help maintain the body's acid-base (pH) balance. It also works with the other electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride) to maintain electrical neutrality at the cellular level. This test measures the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood, which occurs mostly in the form of bicarbonate (HCO3-). The CO2 is mainly a by-product of various metabolic processes.
Measuring bicarbonate as part of an electrolyte or metabolic panel may help diagnose an electrolyte imbalance or acidosis or alkalosis. Acidosis and alkalosis describe the abnormal conditions that result from an imbalance in the pH of the blood caused by an excess of acid or alkali (base). This imbalance is typically caused by some underlying condition or disease.
The lungs and kidneys are the major organs involved in regulating blood pH through the removal of excess bicarbonate.

The lungs flush acid out of the body by exhaling CO2. Raising and lowering the respiratory rate alters the amount of CO2 that is breathed out, and this can affect blood pH within minutes.
The kidneys eliminate acids in the urine and they regulate the concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3-, a base) in blood. Acid-base changes due to increases or decreases in HCO3- concentration occur more slowly than changes in CO2, taking hours or days.

Any disease or condition that affects the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing has the potential to cause acidosis or alkalosis.
The bicarbonate test gives a healthcare practitioner a rough estimate of your acid-base balance. This is usually sufficient, but measurements of gases dissolved in the blood (blood gases) may be done if more information is needed. Bicarbonate is typically measured along with sodium, potassium, and possibly chloride in an electrolyte panel as it is the balance of these molecules that gives the healthcare practitioner the most information.

Bicarbonate testing may be ordered when you have a routine health checkup.
This testing may also be ordered when acidosis or alkalosis is suspected or when you have an acute condition with symptoms such as:

Prolonged vomiting and/or diarrhea
Weakness, fatigue
Difficulty breathing (respiratory distress)

Electrolytes may be ordered at regular intervals when you have a disease or condition or are taking a medication that can cause an electrolyte imbalance.

Bicarbonate levels are typically interpreted along with results from other tests done at the same time, such as the other electrolytes.
A bicarbonate level that is higher or lower than normal may mean that the body is having trouble maintaining its acid-base balance, either by failing to remove carbon dioxide through the lungs or the kidneys or perhaps because of an electrolyte imbalance, particularly a deficiency of potassium. Both of these imbalances may be due to a wide range of conditions.
Examples of conditions that can cause a low bicarbonate level include:

Addison disease
Chronic diarrhea
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Metabolic acidosis
Respiratory alkalosis, which can be caused by hyperventilation
Shock
Kidney disease
Ethylene glycol or methanol poisoning

The bicarbonate (or total CO2) test is usually ordered along with sodium, potassium, and chloride as part of an electrolyte panel, which is included in a basic metabolic panel (BMP) and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). A calculated bicarbonate level might also be reported as part of a blood gas panel.
The electrolyte panel may be used to help detect, evaluate, and monitor electrolyte imbalances and/or acid-base (pH) imbalances (acidosis or alkalosis). The tests may be used as part of a routine health exam or to help evaluate and monitor a variety of chronic or acute illnesses, such as:

Kidney disease
Liver disease
Lung disorders
High blood pressure (hypertension)

When acidosis or alkalosis is identified, bicarbonate tests and blood gases may be ordered to evaluate the severity of the pH imbalance. These tests help determine whether it is primarily respiratory (due to an imbalance between the amount of oxygen coming in and CO2 being released) or metabolic (due to imbalance in the amount of acid produced by the body or ability of the kidneys to remove acid from the body). They also help monitor treatment until acid-base balance is restored.

bilirubin,"['Total Bilirubin', 'TBIL', 'Neonatal Bilirubin', 'Direct Bilirubin', 'Conjugated Bilirubin', 'Indirect Bilirubin', 'Unconjugated Bilirubin']","

None


","

To screen for or monitor liver disorders or hemolytic anemia; to monitor neonatal jaundice


","

In adults, a blood sample is drawn from a vein. In newborns, a blood sample is often collected by pricking the heel of the infant and collecting a few drops of blood in a small tube (heelstick). Non-invasive technology is available in some healthcare facilities that will measure bilirubin by using an instrument placed on the skin (transcutaneous bilirubin meter).


","



Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment, a waste product primarily produced by the normal breakdown of heme. Heme is a component of hemoglobin, which is found in red blood cells (RBCs). Bilirubin is ultimately processed by the liver so that it can be removed from the body. This test measures the amount of bilirubin in the blood to evaluate a person's liver function or to help diagnose anemias caused by RBC destruction (hemolytic anemia).
RBCs normally degrade after about 120 days in circulation. Bilirubin is formed as the liver breaks down and recycles aged red blood cells.
Two forms of bilirubin can be measured or estimated by laboratory tests:

Unconjugated bilirubin is formed when heme is released from hemoglobin. It is carried by proteins to the liver. In the liver, sugars are attached (conjugated) to bilirubin to form conjugated bilirubin.
Conjugated bilirubin enters the bile and passes from the liver to the small intestines, where it is further broken down by bacteria and eventually eliminated in the stool. Thus, the breakdown products of bilirubin give stool its characteristic brown color. Normally, the level of conjugated bilirubin in the blood is very low.

The bilirubin test is included in the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and the liver panel, which are often used as general health screenings.

Usually, an initial test measures the total bilirubin level (unconjugated plus conjugated bilirubin).
If the total bilirubin level is increased, the laboratory can use a second test to detect water-soluble forms of bilirubin, called ""direct"" bilirubin. The direct bilirubin test provides an estimate of the amount of conjugated bilirubin present.
Subtracting the direct bilirubin level from the total bilirubin level helps estimate the ""indirect"" level of unconjugated bilirubin.

A small amount (approximately 250 to 350 milligrams, or about 4 milligrams per kilogram of body weight) of bilirubin is produced daily in a normal, healthy adult. Most bilirubin (70%-90%) comes from damaged or degraded RBCs, with the remaining amount coming from the bone marrow or liver. Normally, small amounts of unconjugated bilirubin are released into the blood, but almost no conjugated bilirubin is present.
If the bilirubin level increases in the blood, a person may appear jaundiced, with a yellowing of the skin and/or whites of the eyes. The pattern of bilirubin test results can give the healthcare practitioner information regarding the condition that may be present. (For details, see ""What does the test result mean?"" under Common Questions.)

When you have signs or symptoms of liver damage, liver disease, bile duct blockage, hemolytic anemia, or a liver-related metabolic problem, or if a newborn has jaundice


","



A healthcare practitioner may order a bilirubin test along with other laboratory tests (e.g., CMP, liver panel) when you have a routine health exam or when you have signs and symptoms of liver damage or disease, such as:

Jaundice
Dark, amber-colored urine
Nausea/vomiting
Abdominal pain and/or swelling
Fatigue and general malaise that often accompany chronic liver disease

A bilirubin level may also be ordered when you have:

A history of drinking excessive amounts of alcohol
Signs and symptoms of drug toxicity
Been exposed to a virus that causes hepatitis

Measuring and monitoring bilirubin in newborns with jaundice is considered standard medical care.
Tests for bilirubin may also be ordered when you have or are suspected of having hemolytic anemia. In this case, it is often ordered along with other tests used to evaluate the breakdown of red blood cells, such as complete blood count, reticulocyte count, haptoglobin, direct antiglobulin test (DAT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD, LDH).



","



Adults and children 
Total bilirubin that is mainly unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin may be increased when:

There is an unusual number of red blood cells (RBCs) being broken down and destroyed (e.g., hemolytic or pernicious anemia, blood transfusion reaction)
The liver is unable to process bilirubin (i.e., with liver disease such as cirrhosis or inherited problems)
You have a relatively common inherited condition called Gilbert syndrome, due to low levels of the enzyme that produces conjugated bilirubin

If conjugated (direct) bilirubin is elevated more than unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, there typically is a problem associated with decreased elimination of bilirubin by the liver cells. Some conditions that may cause this include:

Viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C)
Drug reactions
Alcoholic liver disease

Conjugated (direct) bilirubin is also elevated more than unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin when the liver is able to process bilirubin but there is blockage of the bile ducts. This may occur, for example, with:

Gallstones present in the bile ducts
Tumors
Scarring of the bile ducts

Rare inherited disorders that cause abnormal bilirubin metabolism such as Rotor, Dubin-Johnson, and Crigler-Najjar syndromes, may also cause increased levels of bilirubin.
Low levels of bilirubin are generally not a concern and are not monitored.
Newborns 
Increased total and unconjugated bilirubin levels are relatively common in newborns in the first few days after birth. This finding is called ""physiologic jaundice of the newborn"" and occurs because the newborn's liver is not mature enough to process bilirubin yet. Usually, physiologic jaundice of the newborn is temporary and resolves within a few days to two weeks.
However, if the bilirubin level is critically high or increases rapidly, the healthcare practitioner will diagnose the cause so appropriate treatment can be started as soon as possible.
Increased bilirubin levels may result from the accelerated breakdown of red blood cells due to:

Blood type incompatibility between the mother and her newborn, causing hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)
Certain congenital infections
Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
Diseases that can affect the liver

In most of these conditions, only unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is increased.
A rare (about 1 in 12,000 births) but life-threatening congenital condition called biliary atresia can cause increased total and conjugated bilirubin levels in newborns. This condition must be quickly diagnosed and treated, usually with surgery, to prevent serious liver damage that may require liver transplantation within the first few years of life. Some children may require liver transplantation despite early surgical treatment.



","



Though unconjugated bilirubin may be toxic to brain development in newborns (up to 2-4 weeks of age), it does not pose the same threat to older children and adults. In older children and adults, the ""blood-brain barrier"" is more developed and prevents bilirubin from moving from the blood into the brain and affecting brain cells. Nevertheless, elevated bilirubin strongly suggests that a medical condition is present that must be evaluated and treated.
Bilirubin concentrations tend to be slightly higher in males than females. African Americans routinely show lower bilirubin concentrations than non-African Americans. Strenuous exercise may increase bilirubin levels.
Drugs that can decrease total bilirubin include barbiturates, caffeine, penicillin, and high doses of salicylates. The drug atazanavir increases unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin.



","



A bilirubin test may be used as part of a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) during a routine health exam to evaluate the health of your liver. It may also be used either alone or as part of a liver panel to detect an increased level in the blood to help determine the cause of jaundice and/or help diagnose conditions such as liver disease, hemolytic anemia, and blockage of the bile ducts.
In adults and older children, bilirubin is measured to:

Help diagnose and/or monitor diseases of the liver and bile duct (e.g., cirrhosis, hepatitis, or gallstones)
Evaluate people with sickle cell disease or other causes of hemolytic anemia; these people may have episodes called crises when large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed and bilirubin levels increase.

In newborns with jaundice, bilirubin is used to distinguish the causes of jaundice.

In both physiologic jaundice of the newborn and hemolytic disease of the newborn, only unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin is increased.
In much less common cases, damage to the newborn's liver from neonatal hepatitis and biliary atresia will increase conjugated (direct) bilirubin and unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, often providing the first evidence that one of these less common conditions is present.

It is important that an elevated level of bilirubin in a newborn be identified and quickly treated because excessive unconjugated bilirubin damages developing brain cells. The consequences of this damage include mental retardation, learning and developmental disabilities, hearing loss, eye movement problems, and death.

To check for the presence of a systemic infection; to detect and identify bacteria or yeast in the blood


","

Two or more blood samples drawn from separate venipuncture sites, typically from different veins in your arms


","



Blood cultures are procedures done to detect an infection in the blood and identify the cause. Infections of the bloodstream are most commonly caused by bacteria (bacteremia) but can also be caused by yeasts or other fungi (fungemia) or by a virus (viremia). Although blood can be used to test for viruses, this article focuses on the use of blood cultures to detect and identify bacteria and fungi in the blood.
A blood infection typically originates from some other specific site within the body, spreading from that site when a person has a severe infection and/or the immune system cannot confine it to its source. For example, a urinary tract infection may spread from the bladder and/or kidneys into the blood and then be carried throughout the body, infecting other organs and causing a serious and sometimes life-threatening systemic infection. The terms septicemia and sepsis are sometimes used interchangeably to describe this condition. Septicemia refers to an infection of the blood while sepsis is the body's serious, overwhelming, and sometimes life-threatening response to infection. This condition often requires prompt and aggressive treatment, usually in an intensive care unit of a hospital.
Other serious complications can result from an infection of the blood. Endocarditis, an inflammation and infection of the lining of the heart and/or of the heart valves, can result from a bloodstream infection. People who have prosthetic heart valves or prosthetic joints have a higher risk of a systemic infection following their surgery, although these infections are not common.
Anyone with a weakened immune system due to an underlying disease, such as leukemia or HIV/AIDS, or due to immunosuppressive drugs such as those given for chemotherapy is at a higher risk for blood infections as their immune system is less capable of killing the microbes that occasionally enter the blood. Bacteria and yeasts may also be introduced directly into the bloodstream through intravenous drug use or through intravenous catheters or surgical drains.
For blood cultures, multiple blood samples are usually collected for testing and from different veins to increase the likelihood of detecting the bacteria or fungi that may be present in small numbers and/or may enter the blood intermittently. This is also done to help ensure that any bacteria or fungi detected are the ones causing the infection and are not contaminants.
Blood cultures are incubated for several days before being reported as negative. Some types of bacteria and fungi grow more slowly than others and/or may take longer to detect if initially present in low numbers.
When a blood culture is positive, the specific microbe causing the infection is identified and susceptibility testing is performed to inform the healthcare practitioner which antibiotics are most likely to be effective for treatment.
In many laboratories, the blood culture testing process is automated with instruments continuously monitoring the samples for growth of bacteria or fungi. This allows for timely reporting of results and for the healthcare practitioner to direct antimicrobial therapy to the specific microbe present in the blood. Because treatment must be given as soon as possible in cases of sepsis, broad-spectrum antimicrobials that are effective against several types of bacteria are usually given intravenously while waiting for blood culture results. Antimicrobial therapy may be changed to a more targeted antibiotic therapy once the microbe causing the infection is identified.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Usually, two blood samples are collected from different veins to increase the likelihood of detecting bacteria or fungi if they are present in the blood. Multiple blood samples help to differentiate true pathogens, which will be present in more than one blood culture, from skin bacteria that may contaminate one of several blood cultures during the collection process.
Blood is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. The phlebotomist will put the blood into two culture bottles containing broth to grow microbes. These two bottles constitute one blood culture set. A second set of blood cultures should be collected from a different site, immediately after the first venipuncture. A single blood culture may be collected from children since they often have high numbers of bacteria present in their blood when they have an infection. For infants and young children, the quantity of each blood sample will be smaller and appropriate for their body size.

When you have signs or symptoms of sepsis, which may include fever, chills, fatigue, rapid breathing and/or heart rate, and/or an elevated white blood cell count


","



A healthcare practitioner may order blood cultures when a person has signs and symptoms of sepsis, which indicates that bacteria, fungi, or their toxic by-products are causing harm in the body. A person with sepsis may have:

Chills, fever
Nausea
Rapid breathing, rapid heartbeat
Confusion
Less frequent urination

As the infection progresses, more severe symptoms may develop, such as:

Inflammation throughout the body
The formation of many tiny blood clots in the smallest blood vessels
A dangerous drop in blood pressure
The failure of one or more organs

When a person has had a recent infection, surgical procedure, prosthetic heart valve replacement, or immunosuppressive therapy, the person is at a higher risk of a systemic infection and drawing blood cultures would be appropriate when an infection of the blood is suspected. Blood cultures are drawn more frequently in newborns and young children, who may have an infection but may not have the typical signs and symptoms of sepsis listed above.



","



Two or more blood cultures that are positive for the same bacteria or fungi means that the person tested likely has a blood infection with that microbe. The results typically identify the specific bacteria or fungi causing the infection.
Blood infections are serious and need to be treated immediately, usually in a hospital. Sepsis is a complication that can be life-threatening, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Healthcare practitioners who suspect sepsis may begin patients on intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics that are effective against a wide range of bacteria while waiting for the blood culture or susceptibility testing results. When results become available, the treatment may be changed to an antimicrobial agent that is more specific for the bacteria or fungi detected in the blood cultures.
If one blood culture set is positive and one set is negative, it may mean that an infection or skin contaminant is present. The healthcare practitioner, usually the physician, will consider the person's clinical status and the type of bacteria or fungi found before making a diagnosis. Also, additional testing may be warranted in this case.
Blood culture sets that are negative after several days (often reported as ""no growth"") mean that the probability that a person has a blood infection caused by bacteria or fungi is low. If symptoms persist, however, such as a fever that does not go away, additional testing may be required. A few reasons that symptoms may not resolve even though blood culture results are negative may include:

Some microbes are more difficult to grow in culture, and additional blood cultures may be done to try to grow and identify the pathogen.
Viruses cannot be detected using blood culture bottles designed to grow bacteria. If a viral infection is suspected as the cause of the person's symptoms, then other laboratory tests would need to be performed. The tests that would be ordered depend upon the person's clinical signs and the type of virus the healthcare practitioner suspects is causing the infection.

Results from other tests that may be done in conjunction with blood cultures may indicate sepsis even though blood cultures may be negative. Some of these may include:

Complete blood count (CBC). An increased white blood cell (WBC) count (or in some cases a decreased WBC count) may indicate infection.
Complement. Levels of C3 may be increased.
A urine or sputum culture may be positive, indicating a possible source of infection that may have spread to the blood.
A CSF analysis may reveal a possible source of infection.




","



Because sepsis means that the bacteria or fungi have spread throughout the body, an affected person may experience many different symptoms of illness. As the immune system works to fight the infection, it produces many factors to kill the bacteria or fungi that can also make a person feel sick. Septicemia can cause a fall in blood pressure (shock), a rapid heart rate, and a decrease in blood flow to the brain, heart, and kidneys. It can also affect blood clotting factors, leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can cause generalized bleeding. Bacteria in the blood may also spread to the joints and cause septic arthritis.
Recent innovations in blood culture testing have involved the development of testing methods that will quickly identify the microbes present once a blood culture is positive.
Rapid tests are available that can detect several different types of bacteria that are commonly known to cause infections of the blood. They can identify types such as methicillin-resistant Staphylcoccus aureus (MRSA), which is typically difficult to treat, and gram negative rods such as E. coli that live in the gastrointestinal tract. Rapid identification can facilitate treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
Medical researchers are also making progress on developing tests that will speed up the diagnosis-to-appropriate treatment time by:

Identifying common pathogenic microbes directly from the blood (instead of or in addition to a blood culture)
Helping to rule out sepsis by distinguishing between infection-positive inflammation and infection-negative inflammation
More rapidly determining antibiotic susceptibilities (appropriate antibiotic treatment)

Blood cultures are used to detect the presence of bacteria or fungi in the blood, to identify the type present, and to guide treatment. Testing is used to identify a blood infection (septicemia) that can lead to sepsis, a serious and life-threatening complication. Individuals with a suspected blood infection are often treated in intensive care units, so testing is often done in a hospital setting.
Although blood samples may be used to detect viruses, this article focuses on the use of blood cultures to detect and identify bacteria and fungi. Routine blood culture media cannot grow viruses and therefore cannot detect if the person tested has virus in their blood (viremia).
Other related tests that may be performed include:

Gram stain—a relatively quick test used to detect and identify the general type of bacteria present in other body sites, such as urine or sputum. A direct gram stain of blood is too insensitive to detect bacteria in the bloodstream.
Susceptibility testing—determines the drug (antimicrobial) that may be most effective in treating the infection

Often, a complete blood count (CBC) is ordered along with or prior to the blood culture to determine whether the person has an increased number of white blood cells (or in some cases, a decreased number of white blood cells), indicating a potential infection. Sometimes other testing is also performed, such as a chemistry panel to evaluate the health status of a person's organs, or a urine, sputum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture to help identify the source of the original infection. This is especially true when a person has symptoms associated with a urinary tract infection, pneumonia, or meningitis.

Most often a blood sample collected from an artery, usually the radial artery in your wrist; sometimes a blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm; capillary blood from a heelstick may be used for babies.


","



Blood gases are a group of tests that are performed together to measure the pH and the amount of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) present in a sample of blood, usually from an artery, in order to evaluate lung function and help detect an acid-base imbalance that could indicate a respiratory, metabolic or kidney disorder.
A person's body carefully regulates blood pH, maintaining it within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45, not allowing blood to become too acidic (acidosis) nor too alkaline/basic (alkalosis). The body's regulation of acids and bases has two main components. The first component involves both metabolism and the kidneys: the cellular process of converting one substance to another for energy produces large amounts of acid that the kidneys help eliminate. The second component of regulating pH balance involves eliminating carbon dioxide (an acid when dissolved in blood) through exhalation of the lungs. This respiratory component is also the way that the body supplies oxygen to tissues. The lungs inhale oxygen, which is then dissolved in the blood and carried throughout the body to tissues.
These processes of gas exchange and acid/base balance are also closely associated with the body's electrolyte balance. In a normal state of health, these processes are in a dynamic balance and the blood pH is stable. (For more on this, see Acidosis and Alkalosis).
There is a wide range of acute and chronic conditions that can affect kidney function, acid production, and lung function, and they have the potential to cause a pH, carbon dioxide/oxygen, or electrolyte imbalance. Examples include uncontrolled diabetes, which can lead to ketoacidosis and metabolic acidosis, and severe lung diseases that can affect CO2/O2 gas exchange. Even temporary conditions such as shock, anxiety, pain, prolonged vomiting, and severe diarrhea can sometimes lead to acidosis or alkalosis.
Blood gas analysis gives a snapshot of a person's blood pH, O2 and CO2 content. The following components are generally included in blood gas analysis:

pH—a measure of the balance of acids and bases in the blood. Increased amounts of carbon dioxide and other acids can cause blood pH to decrease (become acidic). Decreased carbon dioxide or increased amounts of bases, like bicarbonate (HCO3-), can cause blood pH to increase (become alkaline).
Partial pressure of O2 (PaO2)—measures the amount of oxygen gas in the blood.
Partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2)—measures the amount of carbon dioxide gas in the blood. As PaCO2 levels rise, blood pH decreases, making the blood more acidic; as PaCO2 decreases, pH rises, making the blood more basic (alkaline).
O2 saturation (O2Sat or SaO2)—the percentage of hemoglobin that is carrying oxygen. Hemoglobin is the protein in red bloods cells that carries oxygen through blood vessels to tissues throughout the body.
O2 content (O2CT or CaO2)—the amount of oxygen per 100 mL of blood.
Bicarbonate (HCO3-)—the main form of CO2 in the body. It can be calculated from the pH and PaCO2. It is a measurement of the metabolic component of the acid-base balance. HCO3- is released and reabsorbed by the kidneys in response to pH imbalances and is directly related to the pH level. As the amount of HCO3- rises in the blood, so does the pH (becomes alkaline).
Base excess/base deficit—a calculated number that represents a sum total of the metabolic buffering agents (anions) in the blood. These anions include hemoglobin, proteins, phosphates, and HCO3- (bicarbonate, which is the dominant anion). Anions are regulated to compensate for imbalances in blood pH. The healthcare practitioner will look at the HCO3- and base excess/deficit results to evaluate the total buffering capacity of the lungs and kidneys when deciding on a treatment to correct an imbalance.

How is the sample collected for testing?
Arterial whole blood is almost always used for blood gas analysis but, in some cases, as with babies, whole blood from a heelstick is collected instead. Blood may also be taken from the umbilical cord of a newborn. Since arterial blood carries oxygen to the body and blood from a vein (venous blood) carries waste products to the lungs and kidneys, the gas and pH levels will not be the same in both types of blood samples. Typically, the largest difference in reported values between venous and arterial blood is the PaO2, and consideration of sample type should be taken into account when reviewing results.
An arterial blood sample is usually collected from the radial artery in the wrist, located on the inside of the wrist, below the thumb, where the pulse can be felt. A circulation test called an Allen test will be done before the collection to make sure that there is adequate circulation in the person's wrist. The test involves compressing both the radial and the ulnar wrist arteries, then releasing each in turn to watch for ""flushing,"" the pinking of the skin as blood returns to the hand. If one hand does not flush, then the other wrist will be tested. Blood can also be collected from the brachial artery in the elbow or the femoral artery in the groin, although these sample locations require special training to properly access. Blood may also be collected from an arterial catheter line but should be taken as to ensure minimal contamination.
In newborns that experience difficulty in breathing right after birth, blood may be collected from both the umbilical artery and vein and tested separately.
After an arterial blood draw, pressure must be firmly applied to the site for at least 5 minutes. Since blood pumps through the artery, the puncture may take awhile to stop bleeding. If someone is taking blood thinners or aspirin, it may take as long as 10-15 minutes to stop bleeding. Following collection, the person taking the sample will verify that the bleeding has stopped and will put a wrap around the wrist, which should be left in place for about an hour.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Typically, no test preparation is needed. However, if someone is on oxygen therapy, the O2 may either be turned off for 20 to 30 minutes before the collection for a ""Room Air"" test or, if this cannot be tolerated or if the healthcare practitioner wants to check oxygen levels with the O2 on, the amount of oxygen being delivered will be recorded. This is usually expressed as fraction of inspired (inhaled) oxygen in percent (FiO2) or as liters of O2 flowing per minute.

A blood gas analysis is ordered when someone has symptoms of an oxygen/carbon dioxide or pH imbalance, such as difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting. It may also be ordered when someone is known to have respiratory, metabolic, or kidney disease and is experiencing respiratory distress.
When someone is ""on oxygen"" (ventilation), blood gases may be measured at intervals to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Other treatments for lung diseases may also be monitored with blood gases.
Blood gases may also be ordered when someone has head or neck trauma, which may affect breathing, and when someone is undergoing prolonged anesthesia – particularly for cardiac bypass surgery or brain surgery – to monitor blood gases during, and for a period after, the procedure.
Checking blood gases from the umbilical cord of a newborn may uncover respiratory problems as well as determine acid/base status. Testing is usually only done if a newborn is having difficulty breathing.



","



Normal values will vary from lab to lab. They are also dependent on elevation above sea level as a person's blood oxygen level will be lower if he or she lives higher than sea level.
Results from an arterial blood gas analysis are not diagnostic; they should be used in combination with the results of other tests and exams to evaluate someone for a respiratory, metabolic, or kidney problem.
Abnormal results of any of the blood gas components may indicate one or more of the following issues:

A person is not getting enough oxygen
A person is not getting rid of enough carbon dioxide
There is a problem with a person's kidney function

A low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) suggests that a person is not getting enough oxygen, while results that are within normal range usually mean that oxygen intake is sufficient.
All other components of the blood gas analysis (pH, PaCO2, HCO3-) are interrelated and the results must be considered together. Certain combinations of results, if abnormal, may indicate a condition that is causing acidosis or alkalosis. These may include the following:

Respiratory acidosis is characterized by a lower pH and an increased PaCO2 and is due to respiratory depression (not enough oxygen taken in and carbon dioxide removed). This can be caused by many things, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and over-sedation from narcotics.
Respiratory alkalosis, characterized by a raised pH and a decreased PaCO2, is due to over-ventilation caused by hyperventilating, pain, emotional distress, or certain lung diseases that interfere with oxygen exchange.
Metabolic acidosis is characterized by a lower pH and decreased HCO3-, causing the blood to be too acidic for proper metabolic/kidney function. Causes include diabetes, shock, and renal failure.
Metabolic alkalosis is characterized by an elevated pH and increased HCO3- and is seen in hypokalemia, chronic vomiting (losing acid from the stomach), and sodium bicarbonate overdose.

Examples of test results associated with the above conditions are summarized below:



pH result
Bicarbonate result

If left untreated, these conditions can create an imbalance that can eventually become life-threatening. A healthcare practitioner can provide the necessary medical intervention to regain normal acid/base balance, but the underlying cause of the imbalance must also be addressed.



","



Arterial blood sample collection is usually a bit more painful than regular venipuncture. You may experience moderate discomfort and a compress may be required for some time to prevent any bleeding from the site.
Sometimes mixed venous blood taken from a central line is used in particular situations, such as in cardiac catheterization labs and by transplant services. Careful interpretation of the results is required. Peripheral venous blood, such as that taken from a vein in the arm, is of no use for oxygen status because it has decreased oxygen content due to the fact that it is composed of blood returning to the heart.

Blood gas measurements are used to evaluate a person's lung function and acid/base balance.
They are typically ordered if someone is having worsening symptoms of a respiratory problem, such as difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, and a condition such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is suspected. Blood gases may also be used to monitor treatment for lung diseases and to evaluate the effectiveness of supplemental oxygen therapy.
Blood gases can also be used to detect an acid-base imbalance, which can occur in kidney failure, heart failure, uncontrolled diabetes, severe infections, and drug overdose. They may be ordered along with other tests, such as electrolytes to determine if an electrolyte imbalance is present, glucose to evaluate blood sugar concentrations, and BUN and creatinine tests to evaluate kidney function.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or from a fingerstick


","



Ketones or ketone bodies are byproducts of fat metabolism. This test measures the amount of ketones in the blood.
Ketones are produced when glucose is not available to the body's cells as an energy source and/or when the body cannot use glucose as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin. Fat is used as fuel instead. When fat is metabolized, byproducts called ketone bodies build up in the blood, causing first ketosis and then progressing to ketoacidosis, a form of metabolic acidosis. This condition is most frequently seen with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes and can be a medical emergency.
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is associated with sudden and severe high blood glucose (acute hyperglycemia), a severe insulin deficiency, and a disruption of the body's acid-base balance. Excess ketones and glucose are dumped into the urine by the kidneys in an effort to flush them from the body. This causes increased urination, thirst, dehydration, and a loss of electrolytes. Symptoms may also include rapid breathing, shortness of breath, a fruity scent to the breath, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, confusion, and eventually coma.
Ketosis and ketoacidosis may also be seen with prolonged starvation, alcoholism, and with high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets (keto diets). It may be induced on purpose in some children with epilepsy who have frequent seizures and do not respond to available medications or other treatments.
There are three ketone bodies – acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone.

Acetoacetate is created first when fat is metabolized.
Beta-hydroxybutyrate is created from acetoacetate. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body present in severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).
Acetone is a spontaneously created side product of acetoacetate.

Different ketone tests measure one or more ketone bodies, and their results are not interchangeable.
Blood testing gives a snapshot of the status of ketone accumulation at the time that the sample was collected. Urine ketone testing reflects recent rather than current blood ketones. Urine testing is much more common than blood ketones testing. It may be performed by itself, with a urine glucose test, or as part of a urinalysis. The urine methods measure either acetoacetate or acetoacetate and acetone but do not usually detect beta-hydroxybutyrate.
Blood ketones may be measured in a laboratory or with a handheld monitor. The laboratory test uses serum, the liquid portion of the blood, and typically measures acetoacetate. Beta-hydroxybutyrate can be ordered as a separate blood test.
When whole blood from a fingerstick is tested for ketones using a handheld monitor, the monitor measures beta-hydroxybutyrate. This test may be performed at the bedside in a hospital or emergency room, in a healthcare practitioner's office, or performed at home.

Blood ketone tests may be ordered if you have diabetes and have symptoms associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and may also be performed whenever there is the potential for DKA to develop, such as when you are sick or pregnant. With the availability of home monitoring, blood ketones can be ordered as frequently as your healthcare provider recommends. Some signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis include:

Having to urinate more often, excessive thirst
Dehydration
Dry skin, cold hands and feet
Rapid breathing, shortness of breath
Rapid heart rate
Fruity scent to the breath
Nausea, vomiting, sweating
Fatigue
Confusion
Coma (sometimes)

In people who do not have diabetes, blood ketones are usually ordered when someone has symptoms associated with ketosis or ketoacidosis, such as those with alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) or prolonged starvation.



","



If blood ketone levels are increased, then you have some degree of ketosis or ketoacidosis.
If levels are low or normal, then you either do not have excess ketone production or the ketone body that is elevated is not being detected by the test method used.



","



Recent studies have shown that serum ketones and beta-hydroxybutyrate testing are both effective in diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some healthcare practitioners prefer beta-hydroxybutyrate. In acute DKA, the ketone body ratio (beta-hydroxybutyrate:acetoacetate) rises from normal (1:1) to as high as 10:1. In response to insulin therapy, beta-hydroxybutyrate levels commonly decrease long before acetoacetate levels. However, beta-hydroxybutyrate is not available in all laboratories.



","



Blood ketones are primarily used to screen for, detect, and monitor a serious, sometimes life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in people with type 1 and sometimes type 2 diabetes. DKA can occur if you have diabetes and your blood glucose is significantly increased, you are ill or pregnant, have a severe infection, or a variety of other conditions.
Blood ketones are sometimes used, along with other tests such as blood gases, glucose, and electrolytes, to detect ketoacidosis in people without diabetes if they have signs and symptoms of DKA due to, for example, drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.

A blood smear is a drop of blood spread thinly onto a glass slide that is then treated with a special stain and the blood cells on the slide are examined and evaluated. Traditionally, trained laboratorians have examined blood smears manually using a microscope. More recently, automated digital systems have become available to help analyze blood smears more efficiently.
A blood smear is a snapshot of the cells that are present in the blood at the time the sample is obtained. The blood smear allows for the evaluation of these cells:

White blood cells (WBCs, leukocytes) — help fight infections or participate in immune responses
Red blood cells (RBCs, erythrocytes) — carry oxygen to tissues
Platelets (thrombocytes) — small cell fragments that are vital to proper blood clotting

These cell populations are produced and mainly mature in the bone marrow and are eventually released into the bloodstream as needed. The number and type of each cell present in the blood is dynamic but is generally maintained by the body within specific ranges.
The drop of blood on the slide used for a blood smear contains millions of RBCs, thousands of WBCs, and hundreds of thousands of platelets. A blood smear examination:

Compares the WBCs' size, shape, and general appearance to the established appearance of ""normal"" cells. It also determines the five different types of WBCs and their relative percentages (manual WBC differential).
Evaluates the size, shape, and color (indicators of hemoglobin content) of the RBCs (RBC morphology)
Estimates the number of platelets present

A variety of diseases and conditions can affect the number and appearance of blood cells. Examination of the blood smear can be used to support findings from other tests and examinations. For example, RBCs that appear smaller and paler than normal may support other results that indicate a type of anemia. Similarly, the presence of WBCs that are not fully mature may add to information from other tests to help make a diagnosis of infection, malignancy, or other conditions.

The blood smear is primarily ordered as a follow-up test when a CBC with differential, performed with an automated blood cell counter, indicates the presence of atypical, abnormal, or immature cells. It may also be performed when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest a condition affecting blood cell production or lifespan.
Examples of signs and symptoms that may indicate one of these blood disorders include:

Weakness, fatigue
Pale complexion
Unexplained jaundice
Fever
Excessive bleeding episodes, easy bruising, or frequent nose bleeds
Enlargement of the spleen
Bone pain

A blood smear may also be ordered on a regular basis when a person is being treated or monitored for a blood cell-related disease.



","



Findings from a blood smear evaluation are not always diagnostic in themselves and more often indicate the possibility or presence of an underlying condition, its severity, and the need for further diagnostic testing. The results are taken into consideration with the results of the CBC and other laboratory tests as well as the tested person's clinical signs and symptoms.
The results of a blood smear typically include a description of the appearance of the red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets as well as any abnormalities that may be seen on the slide. 
Red Blood Cells (RBCs)
Normal, mature red blood cells are uniform in size (7-8 µm in diameter) and do not have a nucleus as most other cells do. They are round and flattened like a donut with a depression in the middle instead of a hole (biconcave). Due to the hemoglobin inside the RBCs, they appear pink to red in color with a pale center after staining the blood smear. When the appearance of RBCs (RBC morphology) is normal, it is often reported as normochromic (normal color) and normocytic (normal size).
While not every RBC will be perfect, any significant number of cells that are different in shape or size may indicate the presence of disease. Some examples of conditions that can affect red blood cells include:

Anemia
Hemoglobin variants including sickle cell anemia and thalassemia
Leukemia
Myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic neoplasms
Bone marrow disorders

There may be one or more RBC irregularities seen on a blood smear. Two examples include:

Anisocytosis — variable sizes of red blood cells may indicate anemia; RBCs smaller than normal are referred to as microcytes and RBCs larger than normal are called macrocytes.
Poikilocytosis — various shapes of red cells; these may include burr cells (echinocytes), acanthocytes, elliptocytes, rouleaux, sickle cells, target cells, teardrop cells, and schistocytes (red cell fragments, helmet cells).
Anisopoikilocytosis — variability in both RBC size and shape

See the section below for Details on Red Blood Cell Irregularities.
White Blood Cells (WBCs)
As part of a blood smear evaluation, a manual WBC differential may be performed. Typically, at least 100 WBCs are evaluated and categorized according to type. The percentage of each type is calculated. In addition, the appearance (morphology) and stage of development of the WBCs are noted. White blood cells have a nucleus surrounded by cytoplasm. All WBCs are derived from bone marrow stem cells. In the bone marrow, they differentiate into two groups: myeloid and lymphoid cells. They mature into five distinct types of WBCs.
Those with granules in their cytoplasm are also called granulocytes (they are of myeloid lineage) and include:

Neutrophils (10-18 µm) are cells that have cytoplasm with pink or purple granules. They comprise the majority of WBCs in a healthy adult. They are involved in the defense against infections.
Eosinophils (10-15 µm) are easily recognized in stained smears with their large, red-orange granules. Generally low in number (1-3%), they most often increase in number in individuals with allergies and parasitic infections.
Basophils (10-15 µm) have large, purple-black granules and are the least often seen type of WBC (1%).

The non-granulocytes include: 

Monocytes (which are also of myeloid lineage) are usually the largest of the WBCs (12-20 µm) and are often referred to as scavenger cells (phagocytes). They can ingest particles such as cellular debris, bacteria, or other insoluble particles.
Lymphocytes are often smaller in size (10-12 µm) and usually have a small amount of cytoplasm and often a smooth, round nucleus although some are larger and can contain a greater amount of cytoplasm. They usually represent the most common type of WBC in younger children. One type of lymphocyte, the B-cell, is responsible for the production of antibodies (immunoglobulins).

Numerous diseases and conditions can affect the absolute or relative number of WBCs and their appearance on a blood smear. Examples of some of the conditions include:

Infections and/or inflammation — can increase certain types of WBCs
Bone marrow disorders — depending on the condition, may increase or decrease absolute and relative numbers of WBCs
Allergies — may affect the number of eosinophils
Leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative neoplasm — immature white blood cells such as blasts may be seen on the blood smear; blasts are normally found in the bone marrow where WBCs are produced and mature before being released into the blood. If blasts are seen on a blood smear, they may indicate a serious bone marrow disease. They can also be seen in other scenarios, such as when the bone marrow is recovering or regenerating from chemotherapy, or, as another example, stimulated by a medication prior to stem cell collection.

See the section below for more Details on White Blood Cells.
Platelets
These are cell fragments that develop from large bone marrow cells called megakaryocytes. Upon release from the bone marrow, they appear as fragments in the peripheral blood. When there is blood vessel injury or other bleeding, the platelets become activated and begin to clump together to form aggregates, which is the beginning of a blood clot.
There must be a sufficient number of platelets to control bleeding. If there are too few, or if they don't function properly, the ability to form a clot becomes impaired and can be a life-threatening situation. In some people, too many platelets may be produced, which may result in interferences with the flow of blood, increasing a person's risk of developing a blood clot. These same people may also experience bleeding because many of the extra platelets may be dysfunctional even though they appear normal.
A platelet count is usually part of a CBC. An abnormally low number or high number of platelets may be further evaluated by preparing a blood smear to directly visualize any anomalies in shape or size. For example, large platelets or giant platelets may be seen as the bone marrow tries to compensate for a low platelet count, but they can also be seen in myeloproliferative neoplasms, or immune thrombocytopenia, a condition in which the immune system inappropriately produces antibodies directed against platelets. (For more information, see the articles on Platelet Disorders and Excessive Clotting Disorders.)



","



Blood counts and morphology can also be affected during times of illness or stress, and after transfusion.
Findings on a blood smear that are abnormal are typically referred to a pathologist, often one with extensive experience in the study of blood (hematology), for further review and interpretation. Depending on the results, follow-up testing involving other bloodwork or even examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may be required for a diagnosis.
Although uncommonly used for this purpose in the U.S., blood smears may be used to help diagnose malaria, a disease caused by a blood parasite. The parasite may be seen when a blood smear is examined under a microscope. Malaria is usually only seen in travelers returning from areas where the parasite is more common (endemic).

To determine your ABO blood group and Rh type


","

A sample of blood is drawn from a vein or from the tip of the finger (fingerstick). In newborns, blood from the umbilical cord or a small amount of blood from a heelstick may be used for testing.


","



Blood types are based on the markers (specific carbohydrates or proteins) or antigens on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). Two major antigens or surface identifiers on human RBCs are the A and B antigens. Another important surface antigen is called Rh. Blood typing detects the presence or absence of these antigens to determine a person's ABO blood group and Rh type.
People whose red blood cells have A antigens are in blood group A, those with B antigens are group B, those with both A and B antigens are in group AB, and those who do not have either of these markers are in blood group O.
If the Rh protein is present on the red blood cells, a person's blood type is Rh+ (positive); if it is absent, the person's blood is type Rh- (negative).
Our bodies naturally produce antibodies against the A and B antigens that we do not have on our red blood cells. For example, a person who is blood type A will have anti-B antibodies directed against the B antigens on red blood cells and someone who is type B will have anti-A antibodies directed against the A antigens. People with type AB blood have neither of these antibodies, while those with type O blood have both.
The following table indicates the type of antibodies a person is expected to have based on their blood type.



a person with blood type ...
will have antibodies to ...




A
B antigen


B
A antigen


AB
Neither antigen


O
A and B antigens



These antibodies are useful for determining a person's blood type and help determine the types of blood that he or she can safely receive (compatibility). If a person who is group A with antibodies directed against the B antigen, for example, were to be transfused with blood that is type B, his or her own antibodies would target and destroy the transfused red blood cells, causing severe, potentially fatal complications. Thus, it is critical to match a person's blood type with the blood that is to be transfused.
Unlike antibodies to A and B antigens, antibodies to Rh are not produced naturally. That is, Rh antibodies develop only after a person who does not have Rh factor on his or her red blood cells (Rh negative) is exposed to Rh positive red blood cells. This can happen during pregnancy or birth when an Rh-negative woman is pregnant with an Rh-positive baby, or sometimes when an Rh-negative person is transfused with Rh-positive blood. In either case, the first exposure to the Rh antigen may not result in a strong response against the Rh positive cells, but subsequent exposures may cause severe reactions.

ABO grouping and Rh typing are performed on all donated blood. They are also performed when people require blood transfusion. Conditions or situations that may warrant a transfusion include:

Severe anemia and conditions causing anemia such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia
Bleeding during or after surgery
Injury or trauma
Excessive blood loss
Cancer and the effects of chemotherapy
Bleeding disorders such as hemophilia

Testing is ordered when a woman becomes pregnant to determine whether she is Rh negative or positive. All newborn babies of Rh-negative mothers are typed for ABO and Rh soon after birth to determine if the mother needs to receive Rh immune globulin.
Blood typing may be ordered when a person becomes a candidate for an organ, tissue, or bone marrow transplant, or when a person wishes to become a donor. It is one of the first of many tests used when determining whether a potential donor and recipient are compatible.
Sometimes blood typing may be done as part of the process for determining whether someone could be a blood relative. For more on this, see the article The Universe of Genetic Testing.



","



The results of blood typing will determine if a person is type A, B, AB, or O and if he or she is Rh negative or positive. The results will tell the healthcare provider what blood or blood components will be safe for the person to receive.
The following table shows what types of blood patients can safely receive, based on their individual blood type.

*These apply for RBC transfusions only; when transfusing plasma products and platelets, the compatible choices are different. (See the article on Transfusion Medicine for more on this.)
Blood typing results will show whether a pregnant woman is Rh positive or negative. This information will indicate whether she may be a candidate for receiving Rh immune globulin, which would prevent her from developing antibodies against her fetus' blood cells.
Typing of donated blood is important because this information allows healthcare practitioners to determine which patients are compatible and can safely receive that blood.
Similarly, when a donor organ, tissue, or bone marrow is compatible with the intended recipient, it is less likely to be rejected in the immediate post-transplant period.

Although Rh incompatibility has more severe consequences, one of the most common causes of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is actually an incompatibility between the mother's and baby's ABO blood groups, not the Rh factor. However, ABO grouping cannot be used to predict whether HDFN will occur because antibodies to the ABO blood groups are naturally occurring.
Besides A and B, many other antigens exist. Having a rare blood type is especially problematic if you need repeated transfusions, as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia patients do. If blood transfusions are not closely matched to blood types of patients, they may suffer transfusion reactions. Such reactions are less likely if donors and recipients are from the same racial or ethnic groups. Molecular testing techniques that analyze a person's genes may be used to predict the presence of unusual or uncommon red cell antigens.



",,"



Blood typing is used to determine an individual's blood group, to establish whether a person is blood group A, B, AB, or O and whether he or she is Rh positive or Rh negative.
Blood typing may be used to:

Ensure compatibility between the blood type of a person who requires a transfusion of blood or blood components and the ABO and Rh type of the unit of blood that will be transfused. Blood typing is performed in conjunction with other tests such as an RBC antibody screen and a crossmatch to determine what type of blood or blood components the person can safely receive. A potentially fatal transfusion reaction can occur if a unit of blood containing an ABO antigen to which the blood recipient has an antibody is transfused to the recipient. For example, people with blood group O have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies in their blood. If a unit of blood that is group A, B, or AB is transfused to this person, the antibodies in the recipient's blood will react with the red blood cells, destroying them and causing potentially serious complications.

	Similarly, if an Rh-negative individual is transfused with Rh-positive blood, it is likely that the person will produce antibodies against Rh-positive blood. Although this situation does not cause problems for the recipient during the current transfusion, a future transfusion with Rh-positive blood could result in a serious transfusion reaction.

Determine compatibility between a pregnant woman and her developing baby (fetus). Rh typing is especially important during pregnancy because a mother and her fetus could be incompatible. If the mother is Rh negative but the father is Rh positive, the fetus may be positive for the Rh antigen. As a result, the mother's body could develop antibodies against the Rh antigen. The antibodies may cross the placenta and cause destruction of the baby's red blood cells, resulting in a condition known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN). To prevent development of Rh antibodies, an Rh-negative mother is treated with an injection of Rh immune globulin during her pregnancy and again after delivery if the baby is Rh-positive. The Rh immune globulin binds to and ""masks"" the fetus's Rh antigen during pregnancy and delivery and prevents the mother from developing antibodies against the Rh antigen.
Determine the blood group of potential blood donors at a collection facility. Units of blood collected from donors are blood typed and then appropriately labeled so they can be used for people that require a specific ABO group and Rh type.
Determine the blood group of potential donors and recipients of organs, tissues, or bone marrow, as part of a workup for a transplant procedure. Along with HLA testing, ABO blood typing is used to identify and match organ and tissue transplant donors with recipients who have the same or an acceptable number of matching HLA genes and antigens.

Urea is a waste product formed in the liver when protein is metabolized into its component parts (amino acids). This process produces ammonia, which is then converted into the less toxic waste product urea. This test measures the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level in the blood. Sometimes, a BUN to creatinine ratio is calculated to help determine the cause of elevated levels.
Nitrogen is a component of both ammonia and urea. Urea and urea nitrogen are referred to somewhat interchangeably because urea contains nitrogen and because urea/urea nitrogen is the ""transport method"" used by the body to rid itself of excess nitrogen. Urea is formed in and released by the liver into the blood and is carried to the kidneys, where it is filtered out of the blood and released into the urine. Since this is an ongoing process, there is usually a small but stable amount of urea nitrogen in the blood. However, when the kidneys cannot filter wastes out of the blood due to disease or damage, then the level of urea in the blood will rise.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that are located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back. Within them are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a microscopic cluster of looping blood vessels, called glomerulus. The glomerulus allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells and larger molecules. Attached to each glomerulus is a tiny tube (tubule) that collects the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus and then reabsorbs what still can be used by the body. The remaining waste forms urine.
Most diseases or conditions that affect the kidneys or liver have the potential to affect the amount of urea present in the blood. If increased amounts of urea are produced by the liver or if the kidneys are not working properly and have difficulty filtering wastes out of the blood, then urea levels will rise in the blood. If significant liver damage or disease inhibits the production of urea, then BUN levels may fall.

BUN also may be ordered:

At regular intervals to monitor kidney function when you have a chronic disease or condition such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, or when you have had a heart attack
At regular intervals to monitor kidney function and treatment when you have been diagnosed with kidney disease
Prior to and during certain drug treatments to monitor kidney function
Along with a creatinine when a CT scan is planned
At regular intervals to monitor the effectiveness of dialysis




","



Results of BUN tests are interpreted along with creatinine results and with other tests results that may have been performed at the same time, such as a renal panel.
BUN and creatinine levels that are within the ranges established by the laboratory performing the test suggest that your kidneys are functioning as they should. Increased BUN and creatinine levels may mean that your kidneys are not working as they should. Your healthcare practitioner will consider other factors, such as your medical history and physical exam, to determine what condition, if any, may be affecting your kidneys.

Some examples of conditions that can increase BUN levels include:

Kidney disease, kidney damage, or kidney failure; for more details, read the article on Kidney Disease.
Decreased blood flow to the kidneys, caused by conditions such as congestive heart failure, shock, stress, recent heart attack, or severe burns
Conditions that can block the flow of urine, such as kidney stones
Dehydration
Increased protein breakdown or significantly increased protein in the diet

Low BUN levels are not common and are not usually a cause for concern. Decreased BUN may be seen in severe liver disease, malnutrition, and sometimes when you are overhydrated (too much fluid volume), but the BUN test is not usually used to diagnose or monitor these conditions.
If one kidney is fully functional, the BUN level may be normal even when the other kidney is not functioning properly.



","



BUN levels can increase with the amount of protein in the diet. High-protein diets may cause abnormally high BUN levels while very low-protein diets can cause an abnormally low BUN.
A wide variety of drugs can cause an increase in BUN. Drugs that can decrease BUN include chloramphenicol and streptomycin. Inform your healthcare provider of any medications you are taking.
Both decreased and increased BUN concentrations may be seen during a normal pregnancy.



","



The BUN test is primarily used, along with the creatinine test, to evaluate kidney function in a wide range of circumstances, to help diagnose kidney disease, and to monitor people with kidney dysfunction or failure. It also may be used to evaluate your general health status when ordered as part of a renal panel, basic metabolic panel or comprehensive metabolic panel.
If your creatinine and BUN tests are found to be abnormal or if you have an underlying disease that is known to affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, then creatinine and BUN tests may be used to monitor for kidney dysfunction and the effectiveness of treatment.
Blood creatinine and BUN tests may also be ordered to evaluate kidney function prior to some procedures, such as a CT (computed tomography) scan, that may require the use of drugs that can damage the kidneys if not cleared rapidly.

To help detect, diagnose, and in some cases evaluate the severity of heart disease, including congestive heart failure (CHF)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) are peptide (small proteins) that are either hormones or part of the peptide that contained the hormone at one time. They are continually produced in small quantities in the heart and released in larger quantities when the heart senses that it needs to work harder. This supports fluid retention and volume expansion in the arteries and veins. Subsequently, the heart muscle is stretched and works hard to pump blood under normal resting condition. Tests for BNP and NT-proBNP measure their levels in the blood in order to detect and evaluate heart failure. The two tests are not interchangeable and should not be used together. Your healthcare practitioner should order one or the other but not both.
It is important to note that heart failure is an incorrect term. The heart still pumps blood, it just has difficulty doing so. If your healthcare practitioners treat you for heart failure, they have several approaches depending upon the severity of the disease.
BNP was initially called brain natriuretic peptide because it was first found in brain tissue (and to distinguish it from a similar protein made in the atria, or upper chambers, of the heart, termed ANP). BNP is actually produced primarily by cells in the left ventricle of the heart. The left ventricle is the heart's main pumping chamber and is responsible for sending oxygenated blood from the lungs to the remainder of the body. It is associated with blood volume and pressure and with the work that the heart must do in pumping blood throughout the body. Small amounts of a precursor protein, pro-BNP, are continuously produced by the heart. Pro-BNP is then split by the enzyme called corin to release the active hormone BNP and an inactive fragment, NT-proBNP, into the blood.
When the left ventricle of the heart is having difficulty pumping sufficient amounts of blood to the body, the concentrations of BNP and NTproBNP produced can increase markedly. This may occur with many diseases that affect the heart and circulatory system. The increase in circulating BNP or NT-proBNP will reflect this diminished capacity to deliver oxygenated blood to the body.

When you have symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, excessive fluid in your abdomen, and swollen ankles and legs after a heart attack or during treatment for heart disease


","



A BNP or NT-proBNP test may be ordered in a healthcare practitioner's office when you have signs and symptoms that could be due to heart failure. These may include:

Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath
Fatigue
Swelling in the feet, ankles, legs, abdomen

Testing may be done in the emergency room or in a hospital bed when you are in crisis and/or have symptoms that could be due to heart failure and healthcare practitioners need to quickly distinguish whether you are suffering from heart failure or some other medical problem.
Several BNP or NT-proBNP tests may be done over a period of time when you are being treated for heart failure to monitor the effects of therapy.



","



Higher-than-normal results suggest that you have some degree of heart failure, and the level of BNP or NT-proBNP in the blood may be related to its severity. Higher levels of BNP or NT-proBNP are often associated with an increased need for aggressive therapy. In some individuals with chronic heart failure, the markers may remain elevated and cannot be used to monitor response.
Normal results indicate that signs and symptoms are likely due to something other than heart failure. 



","



BNP and NT-proBNP levels decrease in most people who are taking drug therapies for heart failure, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics.
Levels of both BNP and NT-proBNP tend to increase with age in the absence of disease.
Levels of NT-proBNP and BNP may be increased in persons with kidney disease due to reduced clearance. Obese individuals may have lower concentrations of BNP or NT-proBNP.
While both BNP and NT-proBNP will rise with left ventricle dysfunction and either can be measured for diagnosis or monitoring therapy, they are not interchangeable and the results cannot be directly compared.



","



A test for BNP or NT-proBNP is primarily used to help detect, support diagnosis, and in some instances evaluate the severity of heart failure. The two tests are not interchangeable and should not be used together. Your healthcare practitioner should order one or the other but not both.
A BNP test or NT-proBNP test can be used, along with other cardiac biomarker tests, to detect heart stress and damage and/or along with lung function tests to distinguish between causes of shortness of breath. Chest X-rays and an ultrasound test called echocardiography may also be performed. Your healthcare practitioner may also prescribe a stress test, which takes place on a treadmill.
Heart failure can be confused with other conditions, and it may co-exist with them. BNP and NT-proBNP levels can help healthcare practitioners differentiate between heart failure and other problems, such as lung disease. An accurate diagnosis is important because the treatments are often different and must be started as soon as possible.
Although BNP and NT-proBNP are usually used to recognize heart failure, an increased level in people who have had a heart attack may indicate an increased risk of further heart disease. Thus, a healthcare practitioner may use either BNP or NT-proBNP to evaluate risk of further heart disease in someone who has had a heart attack.

Bone is the rigid, hard connective tissue that comprises the majority of the skeleton in humans. It is a living, growing tissue that turns over at a rate of about 10% a year. Bone markers are blood and urine tests that detect products of bone remodeling to help determine if the rate of bone resorption and/or formation is abnormally increased, suggesting a potential bone disorder. The markers can be used to help determine a person's risk of bone fracture and to monitor drug therapy for people receiving treatment for bone disorders, such as osteoporosis and Paget disease.
Bone is made up largely of type-I collagen, a protein network that gives the bone its tensile strength and framework, and calcium phosphate, a mineralized complex that hardens the skeletal framework. This combination of collagen and calcium gives bone its hardness, and yet bones are flexible enough to bear weight and withstand stress. More than 99% of the body's calcium is contained in the bones and teeth. Most of the remaining 1% is found in the blood.
Throughout a person's lifetime, bone is constantly being remodeled to maintain a healthy bone structure. There are two major types of cells within bone: osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are the cells that lay down new bone, but they first initiate bone resorption by stimulating osteoclasts, which dissolve small amounts of bone in the area that needs strengthening using acid and enzymes to dissolve the protein network.
Osteoblasts then initiate new bone formation by secreting a variety of compounds that help form a new protein network, which is then mineralized with calcium and phosphate. This on-going remodeling process takes place on a microscopic scale throughout the body to keep bones alive and sturdy.
During early childhood and in the teenage years, new bone is added faster than old bone is removed. As a result, bones become larger, heavier, and denser. Bone formation happens faster than bone resorption until a person reaches their peak bone mass (maximum bone density and strength) between the ages of 25 and 30 years.
After this peak period, bone resorption occurs faster than the rate of bone formation, leading to net bone loss. The age at which an individual begins to experience symptoms of bone loss depends on the amount of bone that was developed during their youth and the rate of bone resorption. Traditionally, women exhibit these symptoms earlier than men because they may not have developed as much bone during the peak years and, after menopause, rate of bone loss is accelerated in some women.
Several diseases and conditions can cause an imbalance between bone resorption and formation, and bone markers can be useful in detecting the imbalance and bone loss. Most often, the markers have been studied in the evaluation and monitoring of osteoporosis, including age-related osteoporosis or secondary osteoporosis, which is bone loss due to an underlying condition. Bone loss may result from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, hyperparathyroidism, Cushing disease, chronic kidney disease, multiple myeloma, or from prolonged use of drugs such as anti-epileptics, glucocorticoids, or lithium.
In children, bone markers are also useful in helping to diagnose metabolic bone diseases and in monitoring treatment of these conditions. Examples include rickets, juvenile Paget disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, sometimes called brittle bone disease, and hypophosphatemic rickets, a type of rickets associated with low phosphate levels and hypophosphatasia (HPP), a disorder causing abnormal development of bones and teeth. To learn more about these, see the links in the Related Content section.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes, a random or timed urine sample is collected in a clean container provided by the laboratory.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
It may be necessary to fast prior to testing. Many of the bone markers vary in the blood and urine depending upon the time of day (diurnal variation), so sample timing can be important. Carefully follow any instructions given for the timing of sample collection, such as collecting a second morning void of urine.

When a bone mineral density scan indicates reduced bone density; before and periodically during treatment for bone loss to evaluate effectiveness, to determine if the rate of loss has decreased or the rate of bone formation has increased


","



Testing may be performed along with other tests such as a calcium, vitamin D, thyroid testing, and parathyroid hormone when bone loss is detected during a bone mineral density test (diagnostic imaging) and/or when a person has a history of unexpected bone fracture.
In children, testing may be done when they have signs and symptoms suggesting a metabolic bone disorder, such as:

Bone and/or joint pain
Increased frequency of fractures
Delayed growth and bone development
Deformed bones
Brittle teeth

For managing and treating bone diseases, one or more bone marker tests may be performed prior to anti-resorptive or bone formation therapy and then typically 3 to 6 months later to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.



","



A high level of one or more bone markers in urine and/or blood suggests an increased rate of resorption and/or formation of bone, but it does not indicate the cause (it is not diagnostic). An elevated level of bone markers may be seen in conditions such as:

Osteoporosis
Paget disease
Cancer that has spread to the bone (metastatic bone disease)
Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperthyroidism
Osteomalacia in adults and rickets in children—lack of bone mineralization, often due to vitamin D or calcium deficiency
Chronic kidney disease (renal osteodystrophy)
Excess use or high doses of glucocorticoids or Cushing syndrome

A low or normal level suggests no excessive bone turnover.
When used to monitor anti-resorptive therapy, decreasing levels of the bone resorption markers over time reflect a response to therapy.



","



Samples must be consistently collected, and test results must be interpreted with caution. There is both day-to-day variability in bone marker concentrations and diurnal variation (changes throughout the day). Most bone marker concentrations will be the highest in the morning, and some, in particular, alkaline phosphatase, are affected by eating.
Concentrations of bone markers are affected by a variety of factors, particularly during childhood development. These include age, sex, growth velocity, nutritional status, and puberty. Therefore, interpretation of bone marker values require use of appropriate reference intervals.
Most people with bone loss are not aware of it. The condition may not cause any symptoms until a person has an unexpected bone fracture.
Since people with breast or prostate cancer have a high incidence of bone metastases, there is also some evidence that bone markers can help healthcare practitioners predict which breast and prostate cancer patients may be at a high risk for complications from bone metastases and thus eligible for bone resorption sparing medications such as the bisphosphonates.
There are limitations to the clinical utility of many of these bone markers, but researchers continue to explore ways to improve their clinical use.



",,"



One or more of the bone marker tests may be used to help determine if a person has an increased rate of bone turnover (resorption and/or formation). Bone markers are sometimes used as an adjunct to bone density testing (e.g., BMD, DEXA scan) to help evaluate bone loss and detect some bone diseases.
In adults, bone markers often are used to monitor response to anti-resorptive therapy for bone disease, primarily osteoporosis, and to help determine if the dose of the drug a person is receiving is effective.
In children, these tests are primarily used to help detect and manage metabolic bone disorders, such as secondary osteoporosis, rickets, Paget disease, and osteogenesis imperfecta.
These tests can detect response to anti-resorption or bone formation therapies in a much shorter time period than the X-ray types of bone density testing (three to six months versus one to two years). This way, therapy can be adjusted or altered in a more timely manner if a person is not responding as expected.
The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the International Federation for Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) recommend two blood tests for evaluating bone turnover:

C-telopeptide (C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTx)) – a marker for bone resorption. It is a peptide fragment from the carboxy terminal end of the protein matrix; used to monitor anti-resorptive therapies, such as bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy, in postmenopausal women and people with low bone mass (osteopenia)
P1NP (Procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide) – a marker for bone formation. It is formed by osteoblasts; reflects rate of collagen and bone formation; may be ordered along with bone resorption marker such as C or N-telopeptide; most sensitive marker of bone formation and particularly useful for monitoring bone formation therapies and anti-resorptive therapies; it is recommended that the test be performed at baseline before starting osteoporosis therapy and again 3 to 6 months later.

Other urine or blood tests used less commonly for bone resorption include:

N-telopeptide (N-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (NTx)) – a peptide fragment from the amino terminal end of the protein matrix; another marker used to monitor therapy.
Deoxypyridinoline (DPD) – a collagen breakdown product with a ring structure.
Pyridinium Crosslinks – a group of collagen breakdown products that includes DPD; used to monitor therapy response; not as specific for bone collagen as the telopeptides.
Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is the version of acid phosphatase produced by osteoclasts, the cells that dissolve small amounts of bone, during bone resorption.

Other bone formation blood tests that may sometimes be used include:

Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) – one of the isoenzymes (types) of ALP; it is associated with osteoblast cell function, the type of cell involved in bone formation. It is thought to have a role in bone mineralization; it is recommended that the test be performed at baseline before starting osteoporosis therapy and again 3 to 6 months later; results may be affected by the level of liver ALP.
Osteocalcin (bone gla protein) – a protein formed by osteoblasts; part of the non-collagen portion of the bone structure; some of it also enters the bloodstream; the level of osteocalcin in the blood reflects the rate of bone formation, thus it is a useful indicator of the function of osteoblasts. This test may be affected by use of the drug warfarin (Coumadin®).

A bone marrow sample collected primarily from the hip bone (pelvis)


","



Bone marrow is the soft and sponge-like tissue found inside the body's larger bones that produces blood cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are procedures used to collect and evaluate bone marrow cells and structure.
Bone marrow has a honeycomb or sponge-like structure, consisting of a fibrous network that is filled with liquid. The liquid portion contains blood (hematopoetic) stem cells, blood cells in various stages of maturation, and ""raw materials"" such as iron, vitamin B12, and folate that are required for cell production.
The primary function of the bone marrow is to produce red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, and white blood cells (WBCs). The number and type of cell being produced at any one time is based on your body's needs (for example, if you are fighting an infection, or to keep up with blood loss) as well as a normal, continual replacement of old cells.
Red Blood Cells (RBCs)
Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, transport oxygen throughout the body. RBCs typically make up about 40-45% of the blood volume and usually survive in circulation for about 120 days. The marrow produces RBCs at a rate that replaces old RBCs that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding, striving to maintain a relatively constant number of RBCs in the blood.
White Blood Cells (WBCs) 
There are five different types of white blood cells: lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, and monocytes. Each plays a different role in protecting the body from infection.
Platelets
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are cytoplasmic fragments of very big cells seen in bone marrow called megakaryocytes and are essential for normal blood clotting.
In the bone marrow, a stem cell undergoes development and differentiation to become one of these different types of blood cells. Those that differentiate into lymphoid cells subsequently develop into lymphocytes. Other precursors further develop and differentiate into granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils), monocytes, platelets, or red blood cells (erythrocytes).
The cells are released from the bone marrow into circulation when they are fully mature or near full maturity. Thus, the population of cells within bone marrow will typically include cells in various stages of development, from very immature to almost fully mature.
Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy as ""tests"" include both the collection of marrow samples and the evaluation of the cells and structure under the microscope. Bone marrow samples can also be sent as needed for various other tests like flow cytometry immunophenotyping, chromosome analysis, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular testing, or microbiology testing (culture). A specialist who has expertise in the diagnosis of blood-related disorders performs the examination and evaluation of bone marrow samples.
Bone Marrow Aspiration
A bone marrow aspiration collects a sample of the fluid that contains cells so that they can be examined under a microscope and/or evaluated with other tests. A specialist microscopically examines slides of stained smears of the fluid from an aspiration. The cells are evaluated according to number, type, maturity, appearance, etc. and compared to those in the blood using results from a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear. This examination determines, for example:

The M/E ratio—this is short for myeloid/erythroid ratio. This calculation compares the number of myeloid cells (WBC precursors) to erythroid cells (RBC precursors).
Differential—determines whether cells in each lineage (WBC, RBC, platelet-producing cells) show orderly and complete maturation, and whether the cells are present in normal proportion to one another.
Presence of any abnormal cells, such as leukemic or tumor cells

Bone Marrow Biopsy
A biopsy collects a cylindrical core sample that preserves the marrow's structure. The biopsy sample is evaluated by a specialist to determine:

Cellularity—the volume of cells is compared to the volume of other components of the bone marrow, such as fat (and whether cellularity is normal for age, increased, or decreased)
Whether the different cell lineages (myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic) are present in adequate numbers
If there are any abnormal infiltrates in the marrow (cancer, infection) as well as any changes to the bone marrow stroma (fibrosis, for example) or bone itself (osteoporosis)

Depending on what condition(s) a healthcare practitioner suspects or is investigating, a number of other tests may be performed on the marrow sample. A few examples include:

In the case of leukemia, tests to determine the type of leukemia may be done. These include determination of antigenic markers (for example, immunophenotyping by flow cytometry) to provide information on the type of leukemia present, including prognostic or therapeutic markers.
Special stains may also be used to evaluate iron storage in the marrow and to determine whether an abnormal erythroid (RBC) precursor with iron particles surrounding its nucleus (so-called ring sideroblasts) is present.
A chromosome analysis and/or FISH analysis may be ordered to detect chromosomal abnormalities in the case of leukemia, myelodysplasia, lymphoma, or myeloma.
Molecular tests may be performed on a sample of bone marrow to help establish a diagnosis. Examples include:
	
T-cell receptor gene rearrangement
B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement
JAK2 mutation
BCR-ABL
PML-RARA


Bone marrow may be cultured to look for viral, bacterial, or fungal infections that can cause a ""fever of unknown origin."" Certain bacteria and fungi can also be detected by special stains.

How is the sample collected for testing?
The bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy procedure is performed by a doctor or other trained specialist. Both types of samples may be collected from the hip bone (iliac crest). Sometimes, a bilateral procedure is performed, in which bone marrow is collected from both the left and right hips.
The most common collection site is the iliac crest (top ridge) of the back of the hip bone (although sometimes the front of the hip bone is sampled). Before the procedure, some patients may need to receive a transfusion, if their blood counts are very low, to prevent excessive bleeding. Most adults tolerate the procedure very well, but some may be given a mild sedative if they are very anxious. Children are frequently put under anesthesia. The patient is then asked to lie down on his or her stomach or side or back for the collection, and the person's lower body is draped with cloths so that only the area surrounding the site is exposed.
The site is cleaned with an antiseptic and injected with a local anesthetic. When the site has numbed, the health practitioner inserts a needle through the skin and into the bone. For an aspiration, a syringe is attached to the needle to collect a small amount of marrow. For a bone marrow biopsy, a special needle is used that allows the collection of a solid core (a cylindrical sample) of marrow.
Even though the patient's skin has been numbed, the patient may feel brief but uncomfortable pulling and/or pushing pressure sensations during these procedures. After the needle has been withdrawn, a sterile bandage is placed over the site and pressure is applied. The entire procedure typically lasts only minutes. The patient is then asked to keep the collection site dry and covered for about 48 hours.

When you are anemic without an obvious cause; when you have or are suspected of having a blood-related disorder or cancer that may be affecting blood cell production; sometimes when a healthcare practitioner is investigating a fever of unknown origin, especially when you have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised)

Bone marrow examination is not routinely ordered. However, it may be ordered when results of other tests, such as a CBC and/or blood smear, are abnormal and a bone marrow examination is warranted.
Bone marrow examination may be ordered when an individual's medical history, physical examination, and signs and symptoms suggest the presence of a disease affecting the bone marrow.
The tests may be ordered when staging certain cancers or when it is suspected that other cancers have spread to the bone marrow.
A bone marrow biopsy and aspiration may also be ordered at intervals when a person is being treated for a cancer to evaluate response of the cancer cells to treatment, whether marrow function is being suppressed by therapy, and, if it is, when its function begins to recover.



","



The laboratory report for these tests may include a description of the cells seen and the appearance of the bone marrow environment. Results from a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear are usually included. Typically, the specialist provides an interpretation of the findings and any other details that might be important in the diagnosis, staging, or treatment of the disease.
In many cases, this information can confirm or rule out a diagnosis and whether the bone marrow is affected by disease, but it can also point out the need for further investigation. For example, a patient with decreased red blood cells (RBCs) and no increase in reticulocytes may have aplastic anemia with suppressed RBC production in the marrow. An evaluation of the bone marrow may confirm this condition, but it does not necessarily tell the healthcare practitioner the specific cause.
The healthcare practitioner uses the information from the marrow evaluation and combines it with information from a clinical examination, medical history, blood tests, and a variety of other tests, such as imaging scans and X-rays, to reach a final diagnosis. It can be a straightforward process or it can be a complex diagnostic puzzle. Patients should stay involved in this process by talking to their health care provider before and after a bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration, asking what the suspicions are, what kind of information is expected from the evaluation, and what follow-up tests might be indicated.
A variety of disorders and conditions may be identified, monitored, and/or staged with this process. A few examples include:

Leukemia — cancer of the blood cells
Anemia — low number of red blood cells and low hemoglobin
Diseases such as aplastic anemia that can affect the marrow's ability to produce an adequate number of each of the different blood cell types and release them into circulation.
Myelodysplastic syndrome — a group of disorders associated with dysfunctional and ineffective bone marrow that leads to decreased production of one or more types of blood cells
Myeloproliferative neoplasms — a group of diseases characterized by the production of too many of one or more types of blood cells in the bone marrow. (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia)
Myelofibrosis — disorder characterized by the overgrowth of the fibrous network found in the marrow, compressing cells and leading to changes in red blood cell shape and changes in the cell counts




","



Complications from the bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy procedure are extremely rare, but they can include excessive bleeding at the collection site or an infection. Individuals should tell their healthcare provider about any allergies they have and about any medications or supplements they are taking prior to the procedure and should contact their healthcare provider promptly if they experience persistent or spreading redness or bleeding at the site, a fever, or increasing pain.



",,"



Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are procedures used to evaluate the blood cells within the bone marrow, as well as its structure. They are performed in conjunction with a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear and sometimes additional testing on the bone marrow to provide information about the health of the bone marrow and its capability for blood cell production, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets.
Using the information from the examination, a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy may be used to help:

Determine the cause of unexplained low or high blood cell counts, including too few or too many white blood cells (leukopenia or leukocytosis), too few or too many red blood cells (anemia or polycythemia), or too few or too many platelets (thrombocytopenia or thrombocythemia)
Identify the cause of abnormal or immature blood cells present in the blood, as detected by a CBC or a blood smear
Diagnose and subclassify cancer originating in the bone marrow (e.g., leukemia, multiple myeloma)
Diagnose other bone marrow disorders, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Diagnose and stage a variety of other types of cancers, such as lymphoma or solid tumors, that may involve or have spread to the bone marrow
Diagnose conditions that affect the marrow and its fibrous structure, such as myelofibrosis
Evaluate for a bone marrow infection if a person has a fever without an apparent cause (fever of unknown origin)
Diagnose a disorder associated with iron storage that may cause stored iron to diminish

If a person is being treated for a cancer, a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy may be ordered to evaluate the response to treatment to determine whether suppressed marrow function is beginning to return to normal.

The B vitamins are nutrients that the body requires in small amounts (micronutrient) for metabolism, energy production, and for cell, skin, bone, muscle, organ, and nervous system health. B vitamin tests measure these specific compounds in the blood or urine to help evaluate a person's nutritional status.
B vitamins are absorbed from the diet, used as needed, and any excess is removed from the body through the urine. Because B vitamins are water-soluble, only small amounts are stored by the body and they must be obtained from foods rich in B vitamins or from supplements on a regular basis. Severe B vitamin deficiencies are rare in the United States but are still prevalent in areas of the world with diet deficiencies.
B vitamin deficiencies can occur when:

There is an inadequate supply of B vitamins.
You are unable to absorb or utilize one or more of the vitamins.
You eat foods or take drugs that slow or prevent the absorption, production or action of a vitamin.
A deficiency in another vitamin or mineral prevents its use.
The need for the vitamin is increased.

In the U.S., B vitamin deficiencies are primarily seen in people with general malnutrition, chronic alcoholism, malabsorption or digestive disorders (e.g., celiac disease), those who have had gastric bypass surgery, and in the elderly. They are also sometimes seen with other chronic diseases, with cancer and cancer treatment, with use of medicines that interfere with the breakdown and use of vitamins, with special diets, and with diarrhea that lasts more than a few days to weeks.
Pregnant women with a limited diet can be at an increased risk for B vitamin deficiencies and so can their babies. Rarely, a baby may have an inborn error of metabolism – a condition that prevents the proper use of a B vitamin.
Symptoms associated with B vitamin deficiencies can be nonspecific, especially with mild to moderate deficiencies. Individuals often have multiple vitamin deficiencies, so they may also have a wide variety of symptoms. Common deficiency symptoms include a rash, dermatitis, red, swollen tongue, numbness, tingling or burning in the hands or feet, anemia, fatigue, and mental changes.
B vitamin toxicity rarely occurs, usually when someone ingests much more than the recommended dose of supplements. High concentrations of a few of the B vitamins may affect the liver or nervous system.
The B vitamins include:



B1, Thiamine or thiamin

			Also known as: Vitamin F, Aneurin, Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) – physiologically active form
Role: B1 is a coenzyme that helps the body produce energy, is involved in glucose, amino acid, lipid, and alcohol metabolism, and is required for the proper functioning of the nervous system, heart, and muscles.
Sources: Whole grains and fortified bread, cereal, pasta, and rice; Meat (especially pork) and fish; Legumes (such as black beans and soybeans), seeds, and nuts
Deficiency: Found primarily with chronic alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, those who have had bariatric surgery and older individuals. Some medicines such as furosemide and 5-fluorouracil can lower thiamin levels in the body. Thiamin deficiency can cause loss of weight and appetite, confusion, memory loss, muscle weakness, and heart problems. It causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which mostly affects people with alcoholism, with tingling and numbness in the hands and feet, severe memory loss, disorientation, and confusion. Less commonly, severe thiamin deficiency leads to a disease called beriberi.
Test name: Thiamine (Thiamine diphosphate) in blood
			Other ways to measure: Transketolase (functional thiamine test)







B2, Riboflavin

			Also known as: Vitamin G
Role: B2 is a coenzyme involved in energy production, cellular function, growth, and development; and metabolism of fats, drugs, and steroids, and is required for the metabolism of other B vitamins. In addition, riboflavin helps maintain normal levels of homocysteine, an amino acid in the blood.
Sources: Eggs, organ meats (such as kidneys and liver), lean meats, and low-fat milk; Green vegetables (such as asparagus, broccoli, and spinach); Fortified cereals, bread, and grain products
Deficiency: Called ariboflavinosis, usually seen along with other vitamin deficiencies in those with alcoholism, malabsorption, liver disease, in the elderly, vegetarians (especially strict vegetarians who avoid dairy foods and eggs), pregnant women and breastfeeding women and their babies. Riboflavin deficiency can cause skin disorders, sores at the corners of your mouth, swollen and cracked lips, hair loss, sore throat, liver disorders, and problems with reproductive and nervous systems. Severe, long-term riboflavin deficiency can cause anemia and cataracts.
Test name: Riboflavin, blood or urine
			Other ways to measure: Glutathione reductase in erythrocytes (activity)







B3, Niacin

			Also known as: Nicotinic acid, Nicotinamide, Vitamin P, Vitamin PP
Role: B3 is involved in enzyme reactions, metabolism, and energy production. It is given in pharmacologic doses to lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise HDL cholesterol
Sources: Meats, such as poultry, beef, pork, and fish; Some types of nuts, legumes, and grains; Enriched and fortified foods, such as many breads and cereals
Deficiency: Seen in undernourished people with AIDS, alcohol use disorder, anorexia, inflammatory bowel disease, or liver cirrhosis; with carcinoid syndrome, a condition in which slow-growing tumors develop in the digestive tract. Severe niacin deficiency leads to a disease called pellagra, classic symptoms are dermatitis (rough skin that turns red or brown in the sun), a bright red tongue, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, depression, headaches, extreme tiredness, aggressive, paranoid, suicidal behavior, hallucinations, apathy, loss of memory
Toxicity: Pharmacologic doses can cause flushing, headaches, low blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, blurred or impaired vision and fluid buildup in the eyes. High doses may damage liver.
Test name: Niacin and metabolites in blood or urine; N1-Methylnicotinamide, N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide in urine thought to be the most reliable measure of intake and body status
			Other ways to measure: measured as NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) in blood or urine







B5, Pantothenic acid

			Role: B5 helps break down and use fats, proteins, and carbohydrates.
Sources: Most foods
Deficiency: B5 deficiency is rare as it is widely distributed in foods. However, people with a rare inherited disorder called pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration can't use pantothenic acid properly. This disorder can lead to symptoms of pantothenic acid deficiency, associated with ""burning feet"" and impaired wound healing.
Test name: Pantothenic acid in blood or urine







B6, Pyridoxal Phosphate (PLP)

			Role: B6 is a coenzyme involved in amino acid metabolism and hemoglobin synthesis. It is also necessary for the nervous system and immune system.
Sources: Poultry, fish, and organ meats; Potatoes and other starchy vegetables; Fruit (other than citrus)
Deficiency: B6 deficiency is rare by itself; adequate B2 is required for the formation of active PLP; may be seen with chronic alcoholism, malabsorption, smoking, kidney malfunction, autoimmune disorders and in those who take certain antiepileptic drugs and theophylline. Deficiency can cause anemia, itchy rashes, scaly skin on the lips, cracks at the corners of the mouth, a swollen tongue, depression, confusion, and a weak immune system. Infants who do not get enough vitamin B6 can become irritable or develop extremely sensitive hearing or seizures. Overdosing can cause severe nerve damage, leading people to lose control of their bodily movements.
Test name: Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) in blood
			Other ways to measure: Vitamin B6 functional test, Urine 4-pyridoxic acid, urine xanthurenic acid







B7, Biotin

			Also known as: Vitamin H, Coenzyme R, Biopeiderm
Role: B7 is a coenzyme that is necessary for fat, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism and plays a role in hormone production.
Sources: Meat, fish, eggs, and organ meats (such as liver); Seeds and nuts; Certain vegetables (such as sweet potatoes, spinach, and broccoli). B7 is also made by intestinal bacteria.
Deficiency: Very rare; may occur in those receiving total parenteral nutrition, with chronic alcohol abuse, and with some inborn errors of metabolism, such as ""biotinidase deficiency""; deficiency of biotin can cause thinning hair and loss of body hair; a rash around the eyes, nose, mouth, and anal area; pinkeye; seizures; skin infection; brittle nails; and nervous system disorders. Symptoms of biotin deficiency in infants include weak muscle tone, sluggishness, and delayed development. Biotin has not been shown to cause any harm. However, supplements that contain biotin may cause false results in many lab tests, including but not limited to cardiovascular diagnostic tests and hormone tests.
Test names: Biotin in blood
			Other ways to measure: Urinary 3-hydroxyisovalerate excretion







B12, Cobalamin

			See the article on Vitamin B12 and Folate







B9, Folic Acid or Folate

			Also known as: Vitamin B9, Vitamin M
			See the article on Vitamin B12 and Folate

When you have symptoms that may be due to a B vitamin deficiency, are at risk for a deficiency, or have a condition associated with malabsorption


","



Testing is primarily ordered when you have signs and symptoms that may be due to a B vitamin deficiency. Signs and symptoms depend on the vitamins that are deficient. Examples of some of the common ones include:

Rash, dermatitis
Inflamed tongue, sores on the lips or in the mouth, cracks at the corners of the mouth
Numbness, tingling or burning in the hands or feet (peripheral neuropathy)
Anemia
Fatigue, insomnia
Irritability, difficulty with memory, depression

Testing may also be ordered when you have a condition that puts you at risk of B vitamin deficiencies. Examples of these conditions include:

A limited or inadequate diet
Malnutrition
Being given nutrition intravenously (parenteral nutrition)
Taking a drug that interferes with absorbing, using or breaking down vitamin B
Gastric bypass surgery
Alcoholism
Chronic diseases associated with malabsorption, such as celiac disease




","



Test results that are low may indicate a B vitamin deficiency but will not reveal whether it is due to an inadequate supply or an inability to absorb or use available B vitamins.
If test results are normal, then it is more likely that your symptoms are due to another cause.
A high B vitamin level may be associated with vitamin toxicity. This rarely occurs and when it does, it is usually due to taking high doses of the vitamin supplements.



","



A person may sometimes be diagnosed and treated for a B vitamin deficiency based upon clinical findings and a response to treatment, rather than testing. For instance, if a healthcare provider suspects a B1 deficiency, the provider may prescribe B vitamin supplements and then monitor you to see if symptoms resolve.



","



One or more B vitamin tests may be used to diagnose deficiencies if you have typical symptoms.
B vitamin toxicity rarely occurs so testing is not often done for this purpose. High concentrations of a few of the B vitamins may affect the liver or nervous system.

ca-125,['CA 125 Tumor Marker'],"

None


","

To monitor treatment for ovarian cancer or to detect recurrence of disease; sometimes to evaluate a lump located in the pelvic area (pelvic mass); not recommended for screening asymptomatic women but sometimes ordered to help detect early ovarian cancer in those identified as being at high risk


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) is a protein that is present on the surface of most, but not all, ovarian cancer cells. This makes the test useful as a tumor marker in specific circumstances. The CA-125 test measures the amount of CA-125 protein in your blood.
Significantly elevated concentrations of CA-125 may be present in the blood of a woman who has ovarian cancer. Thus, the test may be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and/or for recurrence of the cancer. However, not all women with ovarian cancer will have elevated CA-125 so the test may not be useful in all cases.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the lifetime risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 78 and the lifetime risk of death is 1 in 108. ACS estimates that in 2019 about 22,530 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. and about 13,980 women will die of it.
Currently, less than 20% of ovarian cancers are found in the early stages before they have spread outside the ovary. The primary reason they go undetected is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly non-specific.
The need for a reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women continues to drive ongoing research. In the meantime, regular physicals, pelvic exams, and an awareness of your family history and symptoms are important.
CA-125 is not recommended as a screening test for asymptomatic women because it is non-specific. Small quantities of CA-125 are produced by normal tissues throughout your body and by some other cancers. Levels in your blood may be moderately elevated with a variety of non-cancerous conditions, including menstruation, pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease.

","

Before starting therapy for ovarian cancer and at intervals during and after treatment; sometimes when you have a pelvic mass or are at a high risk for developing ovarian cancer


","



The CA-125 test may be ordered before you start ovarian cancer treatment as a baseline to compare against future measurements. During therapy, a healthcare practitioner may order CA-125 testing at intervals to monitor response to therapy. CA-125 may also be measured periodically after therapy is completed.
In some cases, a healthcare practitioner may order a CA-125 test when you have a pelvic mass in order to help determine the cause.
Some healthcare providers may order a CA-125 test and a transvaginal ultrasound at regular intervals when you are at high risk of developing ovarian cancer.



","




If your CA-125 levels are initially high and then fall during therapy, this generally indicates that the cancer is responding to treatment.
If the CA-125 levels rise or stay the same, then your cancer may not be responding to therapy.
An initial fall of CA-125 levels after treatment is completed with a subsequent rise in CA-125 levels may indicate that your cancer has come back.

If you have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer and your baseline CA-125 level is normal, then the test is not likely to be useful to monitor your ovarian cancer. In this case, the ovarian cancer may not be producing CA-125 and is not a good marker of disease progression.
If you have a pelvic mass and are at a high risk for developing ovarian cancer, a significantly elevated CA-125 is a concern but does not necessarily indicate ovarian cancer. This finding would prompt further laboratory testing and clinical evaluation.



",,"



CA-125 is a tumor marker primarily used to monitor therapy during treatment for ovarian cancer. CA-125 is also used to detect whether your cancer has come back after treatment is completed. A series of CA-125 tests that shows rising or falling levels is often more useful than a single result.
CA-125 is sometimes used along with transvaginal ultrasound to test and monitor women who have a high risk for ovarian cancer but who do not yet have the disease. The most significant risk factor for ovarian cancer is an inherited genetic variant in one of two genes: breast cancer gene1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) - see BRCA Gene Mutation Testing. Women with an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome may also have a higher risk of ovarian cancer (a lifetime risk of about 10%). Other risk factors are family history, increasing age, reproductive history and infertility, use of hormone replacement therapy, and obesity.
Sometimes a CA-125 test may be ordered along with a transvaginal ultrasound to help investigate a lump in woman's lower abdominal area (pelvic mass.)
The test is not used, however, to screen women for ovarian cancer because it is non-specific. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening women for ovarian cancer. This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women but not to women at high risk for developing ovarian cancer, such as those with a genetic mutation.
Currently, there is no one reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women. Less than 20% of ovarian cancers are found in the early stages before they have spread outside the ovary. One reason they go undetected is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly non-specific. In the meantime, regular physicals, pelvic exams, and an awareness of your family history and other risk factors are important.

ca-15-3,"['CA-Breast', 'Cancer Antigen-Breast']","

None


","

To monitor the response to treatment of invasive breast cancer and to help watch for recurrence of the disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) is a protein that is produced by normal breast cells. In many people with cancerous breast tumors, there is an increased production of CA 15-3 and the related cancer antigen 27.29. CA 15-3 does not cause cancer; rather, it is shed by the tumor cells and enters the blood. This test measures CA 15-3 in the blood.
Since CA 15-3 can be measured in the blood, it is useful as a tumor marker to follow the course of the cancer. CA 15-3 is elevated in fewer than 50% of women with early localized, breast cancer or with a small tumor, but is elevated in about 80% of those with breast cancer that has spread (metastatic). Because not all women with invasive breast cancer will have elevated CA 15-3, the test is not useful in all cases.
CA 15-3 is not recommended as a screening test to detect breast cancer in women because it is non-specific. It may also be elevated in healthy people and in individuals with other cancers such as colon, lung, pancreas, ovarian, or prostate malignancies or certain conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and benign breast disease.

","

When you have been or are being treated for invasive breast cancer


","



CA 15-3 may be ordered along with other tests when advanced breast cancer is first diagnosed to help determine cancer characteristics and treatment options. If CA 15-3 is initially elevated, then it may be ordered periodically to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to help watch for recurrence. CA 15-3 is usually not ordered when breast cancer is detected early, before it has spread (metastasized), because levels will not be elevated in the majority of early cancers.



","



In general, the higher the CA 15-3 level, the more advanced the breast cancer and the greater the amount of cancer present (tumor burden). CA 15-3 concentrations tend to increase as the cancer grows. In metastatic breast cancer, the highest levels of CA 15-3 often are seen when the cancer has spread to the bones and/or the liver.
Increasing concentrations of CA 15-3 over time may indicate that a person is not responding to treatment or that the cancer is recurring.
Normal CA 15-3 levels do not ensure that a person does not have localized or metastatic breast cancer. It may be too early in the disease process for elevated levels of CA 15-3 to be detected or the person may be one of the roughly 20% to 25% of individuals with advanced breast cancer whose tumors do not shed CA 15-3.
Mild to moderate elevations of CA 15-3 are seen in a variety of conditions, including cancer of the lung, pancreas, ovary, prostate, and colon as well as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and benign breast disorders and in a certain percentage of apparently healthy individuals. The CA 15-3 elevations seen in non-cancerous conditions tend to be stable over time.



","



Laboratories may use different methods to test for CA 15-3, so results can vary from lab to lab. If you are having a series of CA 15-3 tests done, it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to discuss this issue with your healthcare practitioner.
Levels of CA 15-3 are not usually measured immediately after breast cancer treatment begins. There have been instances of transient increases and decreases in CA 15-3 that do not correlate with the person's progress. Usually, the healthcare practitioner will wait a few weeks after starting treatment to begin monitoring CA 15-3 levels.



",,"



The cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) test and the related CA 27.29 test are mainly used to monitor response to breast cancer treatment and to help watch for breast cancer recurrence. They are used along with other clinical evaluations and tests, such as estrogen and progesterone receptors, Her2/neu, and gene expression tests for breast cancer, to evaluate a person's breast cancer.
CA 15-3 is sometimes ordered to provide a general sense of how much cancer may be present (the tumor burden). CA 15-3 can only be used as a marker if the cancer is producing elevated amounts of it, so this test is not useful for all people with breast cancer.
The CA 15-3 and CA 27.29 tests are not sensitive or specific enough to use as a screening test for cancer because non-cancerous conditions can cause elevated levels.

calcitonin,"['Human Calcitonin', 'Thyrocalcitonin']","

Overnight fasting may be required; follow instructions provided by your healthcare practitioner or the laboratory.


","

To help diagnose and monitor C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer; to screen those at risk for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Calcitonin is a hormone that helps regulate how the body uses calcium. It is produced by special cells in the thyroid called C-cells. The thyroid is a small butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck. Besides calcitonin, the thyroid produces other hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and some triiodothyronine (T3), that help control the rate of metabolism.
In two rare conditions, C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), excess amounts of calcitonin are produced. The calcitonin test measures the level in the blood and may be used to detect and monitor these conditions.

C-cell hyperplasia is a benign condition that causes abnormal growth of cells in the thyroid. It may or may not progress to become medullary thyroid cancer.
Medullary thyroid cancer is malignant – it can spread beyond the thyroid and can be difficult to treat if it is not discovered early.

Medullary cancer is a rare form of thyroid cancer that accounts for about 4% of all thyroid cancers in the United States. Approximately 52,000 people are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year, and about 2,000 people die of the disease.
About 75% of medullary thyroid cancer cases are sporadic, occurring in people who do not have a family history of the disease. Most sporadic cases develop when people are in their 40s or 50s and are more common in women than men.
Up to 25% of cases of MTC are related to an inherited variant (mutation) in the RET gene that leads to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2). MEN 2 is a syndrome associated with several related diseases, including medullary thyroid cancer and pheochromocytomas. The RET gene variant is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This means you only need to inherit one copy of the gene variant from either your father or mother to have a greatly increased risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer. This inherited form affects both men and women equally and can occur at a younger age. (For more details, see the article on Thyroid Cancer.)

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have medullary thyroid cancer or when you are being treated for it, or when a family member has medullary thyroid cancer or MEN 2


","



Calcitonin levels may be ordered when it is suspected that you have C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid cancer. These conditions may be suspected when you have signs and symptoms, such as:

A lump or swelling at the front of your neck
Pain in your throat or front of your neck
A change in your voice, hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing or breathing
Persistent cough not associated with a cold

Calcitonin tests may be ordered periodically for family members of those who have MEN 2, starting at an early age, in order to detect medullary thyroid cancer or C-cell hyperplasia as early as possible.
When you have been treated for medullary thyroid cancer, calcitonin testing will usually be ordered at regular intervals to monitor treatment effectiveness and recurrence.



","



Calcitonin levels are normally low. However, a low result does not rule out medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). While most people with sporadic MTC have high calcitonin levels, about 30% of people with familial MTC or MEN 2 have normal levels.
An elevated level of calcitonin means that excess amounts are being produced. Significantly elevated levels of calcitonin (e.g., greater than 20 times the upper limit) are a good indicator of C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid cancer. Likewise, if you have early C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid cancer, you will usually have very significant increases in your levels of calcitonin during a calcitonin stimulation test. However, your healthcare practitioner will use other procedures, such as a thyroid biopsy, scan, and ultrasound, to establish the diagnosis. (See the article on Thyroid Cancer for more about these procedures.)
With successful treatment for medullary thyroid cancer, which may involve surgery to remove the thyroid gland and often some surrounding tissues, calcitonin levels will usually fall to very low levels. If the values stay low over time, then it is likely that the treatment was effective.
In some cases, calcitonin levels will fall but remain moderately elevated after treatment. This may mean that some tissue that produces calcitonin remains. Healthcare practitioners will monitor calcitonin and watch for increases over time. If calcitonin levels begin to rise, then it is likely that medullary thyroid cancer has returned.



","



With medullary thyroid cancer and C-cell hyperplasia, other thyroid tests, such as T4, T3, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), are usually normal while calcitonin levels are elevated.
Calcitonin levels may be increased with use of drugs such as epinephrine, glucagon, and oral contraceptives, and are normally higher in newborns as well as in women during pregnancy.



","



The calcitonin test is primarily used to help diagnose C-cell hyperplasia and medullary thyroid cancer, to help determine whether treatment has been effective, and to monitor for recurrence of thyroid cancer. Testing may be used to help detect medullary thyroid cancer in family members of people with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2).
A stimulation test is more sensitive than a single calcitonin measurement. This procedure involves collecting an initial blood sample (baseline), then giving an injection of intravenous calcium or pentagastrin, substances that stimulate the thyroid to produce calcitonin. Several more blood samples are collected over the next several minutes to measure the effect of the stimulation.

calcium,"['Total Calcium', 'Ionized Calcium']","

Current practices do not require fasting. You may be instructed to stop taking certain medications, such as lithium, antacids, diuretics, and vitamin D supplements, among others, to ensure the most accurate test results.


","

To screen for, diagnose, and monitor a range of medical conditions


","

A blood sample is taken by needle from a vein in the arm. If a urine collection is required, a 24-hour urine sample or a timed collection of a shorter duration is obtained. Sometimes a random urine collection may be used, although a timed collection is preferred.


","



Calcium is the most abundant and one of the most important minerals in the body. It is essential for cell signaling and the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart. Calcium is needed for blood clotting and is crucial for the formation, density, and maintenance of bones and teeth. This test measures the amount of calcium in the blood or urine, which reflects the amount of total and ionized calcium in the body.
About 99% of calcium is found complexed in the bones, while the remaining 1% circulates in the blood. Calcium levels are tightly controlled; if there is too little absorbed or ingested, or if there is excess loss through the kidney or gut, calcium is taken from bone to maintain blood concentrations. Roughly half of the calcium in the blood is ""free"" and is metabolically active. The remaining half is ""bound"" to proteins, primarily albumin and to a lesser extend globulins, with a smaller amount complexed to anions, such as phosphate, and these bound and complexed forms are metabolically inactive.
There are two tests to measure blood calcium. The total calcium test measures both the free and bound forms. The ionized calcium test measures only the free, metabolically active form.
Some calcium is lost from the body every day, filtered from the blood by the kidneys and excreted into the urine and sweat. Measurement of the amount of calcium in the urine is used to determine how much calcium the kidneys are eliminating.

As part of a routine metabolic panel; when you have symptoms of a disorder, or known presence of one, affecting your kidneys, bones, thyroid, parathyroid, or nerves or when symptoms of significantly increased or decreased calcium concentrations are present; when someone is critically ill, to monitor ionized calcium levels; when someone has certain types of cancer; when someone is being treated for abnormal calcium levels, to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment


","



A blood calcium test is often ordered when a person undergoes a general medical examination. It is typically included in the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and the basic metabolic panel (BMP), two sets of tests that may be used during an initial evaluation or as part of a routine health screening.
Many people do not have symptoms of high or low calcium until their levels are very out of range. A healthcare practitioner may order a calcium test when someone has:

Kidney disease, because low calcium is especially common in those with kidney failure
Symptoms of high calcium such as fatigue, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, urinary frequency, and increased thirst
Symptoms of very low calcium such as abdominal cramps, muscle cramps, or tingling fingers
Other diseases that have been associated with abnormal blood calcium such as thyroid disease, parathyroid disorder, malabsorption, cancer, or malnutrition

An ionized calcium test may be ordered when someone has numbness around the mouth and in the hands and feet and muscle spasms in the same areas. These can be symptoms of low levels of ionized calcium. However, when calcium levels fall slowly, many people have no symptoms at all.
Calcium monitoring may be necessary when a person has certain kinds of cancer (particularly breast, lung, head and neck, kidney, or multiple myeloma), has kidney disease, or has had a kidney transplant. Monitoring may also be necessary when someone is being treated for abnormal calcium levels to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments such as calcium or vitamin D supplements.
A urine calcium test may be ordered when someone has symptoms of kidney stones, such as a sharp pain in the person's side or back around the kidneys, pain that may progress to lower in the abdomen, and/or blood in the urine.



","



Blood calcium levels do not indicate levels of bone calcium but rather how much calcium is circulating in the blood.
Calcium absorption, use, and excretion are regulated and stabilized by a feedback loop involving PTH and vitamin D. Conditions and diseases that disrupt calcium regulation can cause inappropriate acute or chronic elevations or decreases in calcium and lead to symptoms of hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia.
In most cases, total calcium is measured because the test is more easily performed than the ionized calcium test and requires no special handling of the blood sample. Total calcium is usually a good reflection of free calcium since the free and bound forms are typically each about half of the total. However, because about half of the calcium in blood is bound to protein, total calcium test results can be affected by high or low levels of protein. In such cases, it is more useful to measure free calcium directly using an ionized calcium test.
Normal calcium
A normal total or ionized calcium result together with other normal laboratory results generally means that a person's calcium metabolism is normal and blood levels are being appropriately regulated.
High total calcium (hypercalcemia)
Two of the more common causes of high blood calcium are:

Hyperparathyroidism, an increase in parathyroid gland function: this condition is usually caused by a benign tumor of the parathyroid gland. This form of hypercalcemia is usually mild and can be present for many years before being noticed.
Cancer: cancer can cause hypercalcemia when it spreads to the bones and causes the release of calcium from the bone into the blood or when a cancer produces a hormone similar to PTH, resulting in increased calcium levels.

Some other causes of high blood calcium include:

Hyperthyroidism
Sarcoidosis
Tuberculosis
Prolonged immobilization
Excess vitamin D intake
Thiazide diuretics
Kidney transplant
HIV/AIDS

Low total calcium (hypocalcemia)
The most common cause of low total calcium is:

Low blood protein levels, especially a low level of albumin, which can result from liver disease or malnutrition, both of which may result from alcoholism or other illnesses. Low albumin is also very common in people who are acutely ill. With low albumin, only the bound calcium is low. Ionized calcium remains normal, and calcium metabolism is being regulated appropriately.

Some other causes of low calcium include:

Underactive parathyroid gland (hypoparathyroidism)
Inherited resistance to the effects of parathyroid hormone
Extreme deficiency in dietary calcium
Decreased levels of vitamin D
Magnesium deficiency
Increased levels of phosphorus
Acute inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
Renal failure

Urinary calcium levels may be affected by the same conditions and diseases that affect blood levels (listed above). A high level of calcium in the urine (hypercalciuria) may lead to the formation of crystals or calculi (stones) in the kidneys. About 75% of kidney stones contain calcium.



","



Newborns, especially premature and low birthweight infants, often are monitored during the first few days of life for neonatal hypocalcemia using the test for ionized calcium. This can occur because of an immature parathyroid gland and doesn't always cause symptoms. The condition may resolve itself or may require treatment with supplemental calcium, given orally or intravenously.
Blood and urine calcium measurements cannot tell how much calcium is in the bones. A test similar to an X-ray, called a bone density or ""Dexa"" scan, is used for this purpose.
Taking thiazide diuretic drugs is the most common drug-induced reason for a high calcium level. Taking lithium or tamoxifen may also increase a person's calcium level.

A blood calcium test is ordered to screen for, diagnose, and monitor a range of conditions relating to the bones, heart, nerves, kidneys, and teeth. The test may also be ordered if a person has symptoms of a parathyroid disorder, malabsorption, or an overactive thyroid.
A total calcium level is often measured as part of a routine health screening. It is included in the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and the basic metabolic panel (BMP), groups of tests that are performed together to diagnose or monitor a variety of conditions.
When an abnormal total calcium result is obtained, it is viewed as an indicator of an underlying problem. To help diagnose the underlying problem, additional tests are often performed to measure ionized calcium, urine calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP). PTH and vitamin D are responsible for maintaining calcium concentrations in the blood within a narrow range of values.
If the blood calcium is abnormal, measuring calcium and PTH together can help determine whether the parathyroid glands are functioning normally. Measuring urine calcium can help determine whether the kidneys are excreting the proper amount of calcium, and testing for vitamin D, phosphorus, and/or magnesium can help determine whether other deficiencies or excesses exist. Frequently, the balance among these different substances (and the changes in them) is just as important as the concentrations.
Calcium can be used as a diagnostic test if a person has symptoms that suggest:

Kidney stones
Bone disease
Neurologic disorders

Total calcium is the blood test most frequently ordered to evaluate calcium status. In most cases, it is a good reflection of the amount of free calcium present in the blood since the balance between free and bound is usually stable and predictable. However, in some people, the balance between free and bound calcium is disturbed and total calcium is not a good reflection of calcium status. In these circumstances, the measurement of ionized calcium may be necessary. Some conditions where ionized calcium should be the test of choice include: critically ill patients, those who are receiving blood transfusions or intravenous fluids, patients undergoing major surgery, and people with blood protein abnormalities like low albumin.
Large fluctuations in ionized calcium can cause the heart to slow down or to beat too rapidly, can cause muscles to go into spasm (tetany), and can cause confusion or even coma. In those who are critically ill, it can be extremely important to monitor the ionized calcium level in order to be able to treat and prevent serious complications.

","

To detect inflammation in the intestines; to distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-inflammatory bowel conditions; to monitor IBD activity


","

A stool sample is collected in a clean container provided by the laboratory. This sample should be uncontaminated by urine or water.


","



Calprotectin is a protein released by a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil. When there is inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, neutrophils move to the area and release calprotectin, resulting in an increased level in the stool. This test measures the level of calprotectin in stool as a way to detect inflammation in the intestines.
Intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and with some bacterial GI infections, but it is not associated with many other disorders that affect bowel function and cause similar symptoms. Calprotectin can be used to help distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders characterized by inflamed and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The cause of IBD is not known, but these diseases are thought to be due to an autoimmune process that has been triggered by a genetic predisposition, a viral illness, and/or an environmental factor. The most common inflammatory bowel diseases are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
People with IBD typically have flare-ups of active disease that alternate with periods of remission. During a flare-up, a person may experience frequent bouts of watery and/or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Between these flare-ups, symptoms frequently subside. Many people may go through extended periods of remission between flare-ups. Calprotectin testing can be useful in monitoring disease activity. The test is not specific or diagnostic for IBD, but it may be done to detect and evaluate the degree of inflammation.

When you have bloody or watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, with or without fever, lasting more than a few days


","



A calprotectin test may be ordered when a person has symptoms that suggest inflammation of the digestive system and when a healthcare practitioner wants to distinguish between IBD and a non-inflammatory bowel condition.
Signs and symptoms of IBD will vary from person to person and over time. They may include one or more of the following:

Bloody or watery diarrhea
Abdominal cramps or pain
Fever
Weight loss
Rectal bleeding
Weakness

Testing for calprotectin may be performed when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether an endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) is likely or less likely to be necessary.
When a person has been diagnosed with IBD, a calprotectin test may be ordered whenever a flare-up is suspected, both to confirm disease activity and to evaluate its severity.



","



An elevated calprotectin level is a person's stool indicates that inflammation is likely present in the intestines but does not indicate either its location or cause. In general, the degree of elevation is associated with the severity of the inflammation.
Increases in calprotectin are seen with IBD, but also with bacterial infections, some parasitic infections, and with colorectal cancer. An endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) may be indicated as a follow-up test to help determine the cause of inflammation, signs, and symptoms.
In people newly diagnosed with IBD, concentrations of calprotectin may be very high.
A low calprotectin means that signs and symptoms are likely due to a non-inflammatory bowel disorder. Examples of these include viral infections in the digestive tract and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Unlike IBD, IBS does not cause inflammation. Rather, it causes cramp-like stomach pains and spasms with bouts of diarrhea and/or constipation. In people with low calprotectin results, an endoscopy is less likely to be indicated or useful.
A moderate calprotectin level may indicate that there is some inflammation present or that a person's condition is worsening. A repeated calprotectin test with a result that is still moderately elevated or that has increased is likely to require further investigation and may warrant an endoscopy.



","



Anything that causes inflammation in the intestines can cause an increase in stool calprotectin.
Calprotectin can be increased with the intestinal tissue damage and bleeding that is sometimes seen with use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.
Calprotectin is related to another stool test, lactoferrin. Both are substances that are released by white blood cells in the stool and are associated with intestinal inflammation.
In some cases, calprotectin may be low even when inflammation is present (a false negative). This is most frequently seen with children.



",,"



Calprotectin is a stool (fecal) test that is used to detect inflammation in the intestines. Intestinal inflammation is associated with, for example, some bacterial infections and, in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is associated with disease activity and severity. The calprotectin test is not diagnostic but may be used to distinguish between IBD and non-inflammatory disorders and to monitor the severity of IBD.
A healthcare practitioner may order a calprotectin test to help investigate the cause of a person's persistent watery or bloody diarrhea. The test may be ordered along with other stool tests, such as a stool culture to detect a bacterial infection, a test for ova and parasites (O&P), a stool white blood cell test, and/or a fecal occult blood test (FOBT). If a healthcare practitioner suspects inflammation, then a blood test that detects inflammation in the body, such as a C-reactive protein (CRP), or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) if CRP is not available, may also be ordered. Testing is performed both to help determine what is causing a person's symptoms and to rule out conditions with similar symptoms. This means that additional blood and stool testing may be performed depending on the suspected causes.
A calprotectin test may be ordered to help determine whether an endoscopy is indicated if IBD is suspected. A diagnosis of IBD is usually confirmed by performing an endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) to examine the intestines and by obtaining a small tissue sample (biopsy) to evaluate for inflammation and changes in tissue structures. This testing is invasive and is less likely to be necessary if inflammation is not present.
A calprotectin test may be ordered if a person with IBD has symptoms that suggest a flare-up, both to detect disease activity and to help evaluate its severity. For example, if a person has a moderately elevated calprotectin, then testing may be repeated several weeks later to see if it has stayed moderately elevated, increased, or returned to normal.

","

To help diagnose bone marrow disorders known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), in which the bone marrow produces too many of one or more types of blood cells


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be done to collect a sample for testing.


","



The calreticulin gene, called CALR for short, is responsible for making a protein called calreticulin. The exact function of calreticulin protein remains largely unknown, but it is likely involved in ensuring the correct folding of new proteins, maintaining correct calcium levels in cells, and a number of other cell functions. Mutations of the CALR gene are associated with bone marrow neoplasms that cause the production of too many blood cells. These blood disorders are collectively known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). The CALR mutation test looks for abnormalities in the CALR gene to help diagnose and classify MPNs.
The MPNs most commonly associated with CALR mutations are:

Essential thrombocythemia (ET)—there are too many platelet-producing cells (megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia—there are too many platelet-producing cells and cells that produce scar tissue in the bone marrow

CALR mutations are the second most common genetic abnormality (after JAK2 mutations) associated with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis. They are present in about 20-25% of adults with ET and 25-30% of adults with PMF. Although rare and not well understood in children, 50% of pediatric PMF patients had CALR mutations.
The CALR mutation is acquired after birth as opposed to inherited. It is caused by the addition or removal of small amounts of genetic material to a region of the gene called exon 9. This leads to an abnormal calreticulin protein. It is not yet understood how the mutant protein leads to signs and symptoms of MPN. While more than 50 types of CALR mutation have been found, only the two most common variants associated with MPNs are included in conventional PCR testing. Next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis should detect all mutation variants but is not widely available.
In addition to helping diagnose MPNs, CALR mutation testing can provide information about a person's prognosis. Studies have shown that compared to individuals with the JAK2 mutation, those with the CALR mutation had a milder disease course, fewer signs and symptoms of blood clotting (thrombotic episodes), and better survival.

When you have abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC) and your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have a bone marrow disorder, especially essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF)


","



The CALR mutation test may be ordered, along with other tests, when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) such as essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF). It is typically tested after someone suspected of having an MPN has tested negative for a mutation of the BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 genes.
Sometimes people with MPNs may have no symptoms or a few, relatively mild ones that may be present for years before being recognized as an MPN, often during a routine physical. However, a healthcare practitioner may suspect an MPN and order testing when a person has abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC) in combination with several signs and symptoms, such as:

Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain
Excessive clotting (e.g., a blood clot in a vein or artery)
Easy bruising or bleeding
Headache, dizziness, vision problems
Signs and symptoms related to anemia, such as fatigue and weakness




","



A positive CALR mutation test means that the person likely has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), specifically essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Other testing, such as a bone marrow biopsy, may need to be performed to determine which MPN the person has and to evaluate its severity.
About 20-25% of adults with essential thrombocythemia and 25-30% of adults with primary myelofibrosis have a CALR mutation. The mutation is also rarely found in people with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised its diagnostic criteria for MPNs. The presence of the CALR exon 9 mutation is one of three major criteria listed for diagnosis of ET and PMF.
Carrying a mutated CALR gene can have implications for an individual's MPN prognosis and disease progress. Studies have found that people with CALR mutations have better overall survival than those with JAK2 or myeloproliferative leukemia (MPL) mutations. People with CALR mutations also have a lower risk of harmful blood clots (thrombosis) than those with JAK2-positive ET.
A negative result typically means that the CALR mutation being tested for was not detected. It is possible to have a negative result and still carry an uncommon CALR mutation that the test cannot detect. It is also possible, though unlikely, that the test failed to detect a CALR exon 9 mutation. Note that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based analysis should detect all mutation variants in the CALR gene, but the test is not widely available.
A negative result does not rule out the possibility of having an MPN. Ten to 15 percent of essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis cases have no common genetic abnormality associated with them, i.e., negative for JAK2, CALR and MPL mutations (known as ""triple-negative MPN"").



","



The discovery of genetic mutations underlying MPNs, beginning in 2005, represented a significant step forward in treating them. Drugs called targeted therapies designed to inhibit the abnormal proteins underlying the conditions show promise for being more effective than conventional MPN treatments. While targeted therapies have been developed to inhibit the JAK2 gene, CALR was discovered more recently and therapies to inhibit it are still being studied. Overall, developing targeted therapies to treat MPNs is a promising and active area of study.

The CALR mutation test is used to help diagnose and classify bone marrow disorders that lead to the production of too many blood cells. These disorders are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
CALR mutations are the second most common genetic abnormality associated with two types of MPNs: essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
Testing for genetic abnormalities associated with MPNs is generally done as follow-up if someone has a significantly increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell and/or platelet count, or blood smear findings suggesting myelofibrosis, along with clinical signs and symptoms suggesting an MPN.
Testing for CALR mutation is usually done in conjunction with tests for other mutations associated with MPNs, such as BCR-ABL1 and JAK2 mutation tests.

Primarily to monitor response to pancreatic cancer treatment and to watch for recurrence; sometimes to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; sometimes a healthcare practitioner will collect samples of other body fluids.


","



Cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) is a protein that exists on the surface of certain cancer cells. CA 19-9 does not cause cancer; rather, it is shed by the tumor cells and can be detected by laboratory tests in blood and sometimes other body fluids. This test measures the level of CA19-9.
Since CA 19-9 can be measured in blood, it is useful as a tumor marker to follow the course of the cancer. CA 19-9 is elevated in about 70% to 95% of people with advanced pancreatic cancer. (Read more in the ""How is the test used?"" section under Common Questions and in the Pancreatic Cancer article.)
However, CA 19-9 may also be elevated in other cancers, conditions, and diseases such as: gallbladder and bile duct cancers (cholangiocarcinoma), colorectal cancer, gastric cancers, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, bile duct obstruction (e.g., gallstones), pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, thyroid disease, and liver disease. Small amounts of CA 19-9 are present in the blood of healthy people. Since CA 19-9 is not specific for pancreatic cancer, it cannot be used by itself for screening or diagnosis.
The European Group on Tumor Markers (EGTM) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend use of CA 19-9 as a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer in addition to other tests and examinations to diagnose and monitor the disease.

During and/or following pancreatic cancer treatment


","



CA 19-9 may be ordered when you have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and/or has signs and symptoms that may indicate pancreatic cancer. Early signs and symptoms may be subtle and nonspecific. Examples include:

Abdominal and/or back pain
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Unexplained weight loss
Jaundice

In later stages, there may be chronic pain, nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, and, in some rare instances, problems with blood glucose control.
If CA 19-9 is initially elevated in pancreatic cancer, then a series of CA 19-9 tests may be ordered during cancer treatment to monitor response and on a regular basis following treatment to help detect recurrence.
CA 19-9 may sometimes be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects bile duct cancer in a person with a bile duct obstruction. Non-cancerous causes of bile duct obstruction can cause very high CA 19-9 levels, which fall when the blockage is cleared. In these cases, it is a good idea to wait at least a week or two after the blockage is relieved (by placing a tube, or stent, in the bile ducts) to re-check CA 19-9 levels.



","



Low amounts of CA 19-9 can be detected in healthy people, and many conditions that affect the liver or pancreas can cause temporary elevations.
Moderate to high levels may be seen in people with pancreatic cancer, other cancers, and in several other diseases and conditions. The highest levels of CA 19-9 are seen in cancer of the exocrine pancreas. This cancer arises in the tissues that produce food-digesting enzymes and in the ducts that carry those enzymes into the small intestine. About 95% of pancreatic cancers are of this type.
Levels of CA 19-9 that are initially high and then fall over time may indicate that the treatment is working and/or that the cancer was removed successfully during surgery. Levels that remain high or rise over time may indicate that treatment is not working and/or that the cancer is recurring.



","



Unfortunately, early pancreatic cancer gives few warning signs. By the time a person has symptoms and significantly elevated levels of CA 19-9, pancreatic cancer is usually at an advanced stage.
CA 19-9 is a protein on the surface of cells. It is derived from a blood group antigen called Lewis antigen that is similar to the ABO antigens that are used in blood typing for transfusions. About 5% to 7% of people are Lewis antigen-negative (about 30% in people of African ancestry) and do not produce CA 19-9. The CA 19-9 test is not useful for monitoring people who are Lewis antigen-negative.



","



The CA 19-9 test may be used, along with other tests such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), bilirubin, and/or a liver panel, to help evaluate and monitor a person who has been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and is undergoing treatment.
CA 19-9 is used as a tumor marker:

To monitor response to pancreatic cancer treatment and/or cancer progression
To watch for pancreatic cancer recurrence
Sometimes to aid in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer

CA 19-9 can only be used as a tumor marker if the cancer is producing elevated amounts of it. Since CA 19-9 is elevated in about 65% of those with bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), it may be ordered to help evaluate and monitor people with this type of cancer.
The CA 19-9 test is not sensitive or specific enough to use as a screening test for cancer. It is not currently useful for detection or diagnosis by itself because non-cancerous conditions can cause elevated CA 19-9 levels. Researchers continue to investigate markers to be used alone or in combination with CA 19-9 that may be more useful for screening for and detecting pancreatic cancer in the early stages, when it is most treatable.

None, but you should talk to your healthcare provider about the timing of the sample collection. Often, the recommended time is when the level in the blood is expected to be at its lowest, just before the next dose is taken.

To determine the concentration of carbamazepine in the blood to establish an appropriate dose and maintain a therapeutic level


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Carbamazepine is a drug that is primarily used to treat certain seizure disorders (also called epilepsy) but is also prescribed to stabilize the moods of people with bipolar disease, to ease alcohol withdrawal, and to help alleviate some types of nerve pain. It may be prescribed by itself or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. This test measures the level of carbamazepine in the blood.
Carbamazepine levels are monitored because the drug must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, the drug may not be effective and the person may experience a recurrence of symptoms (i.e., seizures, mania, or pain); if the level is too high, the person may experience toxic side effects. Maintaining a therapeutic level of this drug can be a challenge to achieve for several different reasons:

Oral doses of carbamazepine are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract at widely variable rates. 
Since carbamazepine is metabolized by the liver, anything that affects liver function can affect blood levels of the drug. 
Upon a long-term administration, carbamazepine induces its own metabolism.
Much of the drug is bound to plasma protein, but it is the free portion of the drug that is active. Conditions that affect protein binding of the drug may affect therapeutic effectiveness. This may occur when someone has low blood albumin, kidney failure, or when they are very young (newborn) or elderly. 
The metabolite of carbamazepine, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, is also therapeutically active and contributes to the overall effect of the medication. 
Several drugs, if taken in conjunction with carbamazepine, may interact or affect its metabolism and blood levels.

Dosages of carbamazepine must be adjusted carefully in order to reach a steady concentration in the blood. The actual amount of drug required to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may change over time.
Carbamazepine is usually monitored long-term because it is prescribed to treat the chronic conditions epilepsy, bipolar disorder, trigeminal neuralgia, and nerve pain from diabetes.
Epilepsy affects the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, a person may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to occasional seizures, to recurrent seizures. Carbamazepine is prescribed to help prevent specific types of recurrent seizures.
Bipolar disorder is a mental condition that is characterized by cycles of depression and mania that may last for days, weeks, months, or years. During a depressive episode, those affected may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and have thoughts of suicide. During a manic episode, those affected may be euphoric, irritable, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Carbamazepine is prescribed to help even out the moods of the person with bipolar disorder, especially mania.
Trigeminal neuralgia, a condition associated with facial nerve pain and muscle spasms, and paroxysmal choreoathetosis, a movement disorder that causes involuntary movements of the limbs, trunk, and facial muscles, are also sometimes treated with carbamazepine. So is diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, which affects the functionality, mood, and sleep patterns of approximately 10-20% of people with diabetes mellitus. (For more on this, see the Neuropathy article.)

At regular intervals to monitor the drug's level; when indicated to detect low or excessive (potentially toxic) concentrations


","



Carbamazepine tests are ordered frequently at first, then at regular intervals and as needed to ensure that therapeutic blood concentrations are maintained.
Additional total carbamazepine tests may be ordered if dosages of the drug are changed or if the treated person starts or stops taking additional medications to judge their effect, if any, on the carbamazepine level. Once blood concentrations of carbamazepine have stabilized, concentrations are monitored at regular intervals to ensure that they remain within therapeutic range.
The carbamazepine test may be ordered when a person does not appear to be responding to therapy and has a recurrence of symptoms such as seizure, nerve pain, or bipolar mood swings. The blood level may not be high enough, the person may not be taking the medication regularly, or the drug may be ineffective for that person.
Carbamazepine tests may also be ordered when a person experiences a troublesome level of side effects and/or develops complications. Side effects that may be seen at any dose but that are related to higher concentrations include:

Dizziness
Uncoordinated movement
Sleepiness
Blurred or double vision
Involuntary back and forth movement of the eyeball

Other side effects may include:

Red, itchy rash
Nausea
Diarrhea
Constipation
Headache
Confusion

A healthcare practitioner should be contacted immediately if someone has serious side effects, including:

Pale skin, rapid heart rate, trouble concentrating
Fever, chills, or sore throat
Mouth and throat ulcers
Easy bruising or bleeding
Severe tingling, numbness, pain, muscle weakness
Confusion, agitation, vision problems, or hallucinations
Shortness of breath
Swelling of the ankles or feet
Urinating less than usual
Yellowing of the skin or eyes
Severe skin reaction

Carbamazepine can also sometimes cause liver dysfunction, low sodium levels, a decrease in white blood cells, or an increase in eosinophils (a type of white blood cell). In some cases, the severity of side effects may necessitate use of a different anti-seizure, bipolar, or nerve pain medication.
A free carbamazepine test and/or a carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide test may also be ordered along with the total carbamazepine test when a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate the contribution of the free drug and/or its metabolite to drug therapy. The healthcare practitioner may choose to do so when the result from a total carbamazepine test is within the therapeutic range but the treated person is experiencing side effects. Sometimes results are evaluated as a percentage of free to total carbamazepine.



","



The therapeutic range for carbamazepine when it is taken by itself is about 4 to 12 mcg/mL (micrograms per milliliter). Levels above 15 mcg/mL are considered toxic. Ranges vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory, however, and may be expressed in other units such as mg/L (milligrams per liter). Healthcare practitioners and patients should use the therapeutic ranges and units established by the laboratory that performs the testing.
Within the therapeutic range, most people will respond to the drug without excessive side effects; however, response varies with each individual. Some people will experience seizures, mood swings, or nerve pain at the low end of the therapeutic range while some people will experience excessive side effects at the upper end. Variations in free carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide can contribute to this response. People who use this medication should work closely with their healthcare provider to find the dosage that works the best for them.
In general, if carbamazepine test results are within the therapeutic range and the treated person is not having recurrent seizures, mood swings, or nerve pain and is not experiencing significant side effects, then the dosage of carbamazepine is considered adequate.



","



People should not increase, decrease, or stop taking their medication without consulting with their healthcare provider as it can increase the risk of having a seizure and may affect other medications being taken. Dosage determinations and adjustments must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
Likewise, people should tell their healthcare providers about any other prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, or herbal supplements being taken. A very long list of prescription medicines may interact dangerously with carbamazepine. Among these are commonly prescribed medications, including warfarin, fluoxetine and other antidepressants, isoniazid, theophylline, erythromycin, ethosuximide, and benzodiazepines. Carbamazepine can also affect or be affected by over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and by herbal supplements such as St. John's wort. Do not begin taking a new medication without consulting your healthcare practitioner.
The metabolism of carbamazepine can be increased by drugs such as phenobarbital, primidone, and phenytoin, decreasing carbamazepine concentrations in the blood. Some of these drugs may also require monitoring with other blood tests because the plasma concentrations may be decreased.
Grapefruit juice can increase the level of carbamazepine in the blood.
Some people who take carbamazepine may become more sensitive to sunlight and may need to avoid sunlight. Sunlight may cause a skin rash, itching, redness or other discoloration of the skin, or severe sunburn.
Use of carbamazepine has been associated with aplastic anemia, damage to the bone marrow and blood stem cells, and with agranulocytosis, a relatively lower number of white blood cells.
Carbamazepine can increase the risk of certain birth defects and fetal death and can decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Women of childbearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about this.

The carbamazepine test is used to measure and monitor the amount of carbamazepine in the blood to determine whether the level of drug is within the therapeutic range. Carbamazepine is primarily used to treat certain seizure disorders (also called epilepsy) but is also prescribed to stabilize the moods of people with bipolar disease, to ease alcohol withdrawal, and to help alleviate some types of nerve pain.
Initially, the test may be used to establish the appropriate dose for an individual. Depending on the results of the blood test, the dose of drug may be adjusted up or down until the blood level reaches the therapeutic range. Subsequent tests are then used to ensure that the level remains in the therapeutic range. If a person's health changes or if, for example, they begin taking other drugs, the test may be used to determine whether an adjustment to the prescribed dose is necessary.
A healthcare practitioner may use a carbamazepine test to help evaluate someone who is experiencing side effects or adverse reactions or a recurrence of symptoms.
A routine carbamazepine test measures total carbamazepine, both protein-bound and free portions of the drug. Sometimes a test to measure free carbamazepine or the biologically active metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, is ordered along with the total carbamazepine test to evaluate their contribution to a person's therapy.

Primarily to monitor cancer treatment, including response to therapy and recurrence; as an indicator of the amount of cancer or size of tumor present (tumor burden) and to assist in cancer staging; occasionally as follow up to a positive screening test for cancer, to compare whether the level falls to normal (indicating that the cancer was all likely removed) after treatment for the cancer

A blood sample is taken by needle from a vein in the arm. Occasionally, another body fluid such as peritoneal fluid, pleural fluid, or cerebrospinal (CSF) is collected by a healthcare practitioner for testing.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein that is present in certain tissues of a developing baby (fetus). By the time a baby is born, it drops to a very low level. In adults, CEA is normally present at very low levels in the blood but may be elevated with certain types of cancer. This test measures the amount of CEA in the blood to help evaluate individuals diagnosed with cancer.
CEA is a tumor marker. Originally, it was thought that CEA was a specific marker for colon cancer, but further study has shown that an increase in CEA may be seen in a wide variety of other cancers. CEA can also be increased in some non-cancer-related conditions, such as inflammation, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, rectal polyps, emphysema, and benign breast disease, and in smokers. For this reason, it is not useful as a general cancer screening tool, but it does have a role in evaluating response to cancer treatment. When you have been diagnosed with cancer, an initial baseline test for CEA may be performed. If this level is elevated, then subsequent serial testing of CEA may be performed to monitor the cancer during treatment.

A CEA test may be ordered when you have been diagnosed with colon cancer or other specific type of cancer. It will be measured before therapy is initiated and then on a regular basis to evaluate the success of treatment and to determine whether the cancer has come back after treatment (recurrence).
Sometimes a CEA test may be performed when cancer is suspected but not yet diagnosed. This is not a common use for the test because CEA can be elevated with many conditions, but it may provide a healthcare practitioner with additional information.
A CEA test may sometimes be performed on a fluid other than blood when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a cancer has metastasized (e.g., spread to the pleural or peritoneal cavity).



","



For treatment, recurrence monitoring: 
When CEA levels are initially elevated and then decrease to normal after therapy, it means the cancer has been successfully treated. A steadily rising CEA level is often the first sign of tumor recurrence.
For staging:
On initial testing, people with smaller and early-stage tumors are likely to have a normal or only slightly elevated CEA value. People with larger tumors, later-stage cancer, or tumors that have spread throughout the body are more likely to have a high CEA value.
Testing for metastasis:
If CEA is present in a body fluid other than blood, then cancer is likely to have spread into that area of the body. For example, if CEA is detected in cerebrospinal fluid, this may indicate that cancer has spread to the central nervous system.
Since not all cancers produce CEA, it is possible to have cancer but also have a normal CEA. If a cancer does not produce CEA, then the test will not be useful as a monitoring tool.



","



Laboratories may use different methods to test for CEA, so results can vary from lab to lab. If you are having a series of CEA tests done, it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to discuss this issue with your healthcare provider.
Individuals who smoke cigarettes tend to have higher CEA levels than non-smokers.
Increased CEA levels can indicate some non-cancer-related conditions, such as inflammation, cirrhosis, peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, rectal polyps, emphysema, and benign breast disease.



","



The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test may be used:

To monitor the treatment of colon cancer—it may also be used as a marker for medullary thyroid cancer and cancers of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovaries. An initial CEA test is typically ordered prior to treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as a ""baseline"" value. If the level is elevated, then the test can be used to monitor a person's response to therapy and to determine whether the cancer has returned after treatment.
To stage cancer—cancer staging involves evaluating the size of the tumor as well as how far it has spread.
To help determine if cancer has spread to a body cavity such as the chest or abdomen by measuring the CEA level in a body fluid (e.g., pleural or peritoneal fluid).

A CEA test may be used in combination with other tumor markers in the evaluation of cancer.
Not all cancers produce CEA, and a positive CEA test is not always due to cancer. Therefore, CEA is not recommended for screening the general population.

Cardiolipin antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly target the body's own cardiolipins, substances found in the outermost layer of cells (cell membranes) and platelets. These autoantibodies can affect the body's ability to regulate blood clotting in a way that is not well understood. This test detects the presence of cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.
Cardiolipins, and other related phospholipids, are lipid molecules that play an important role in the blood clotting process. Cardiolipin antibodies target cardiolipins and are associated with an increased risk of developing recurrent inappropriate blood clots (thrombi) in veins and arteries, such as the deep veins of the legs (DVT) or the lungs (pulmonary embolism, PE). They may also be associated with a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), recurrent miscarriages (especially in the second and third trimester), and with premature labor and pre-eclampsia.
Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. They are frequently detected with other antiphospholipid antibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1. They may also be detected temporarily in people with acute infections, HIV/AIDS, some cancers, with drug treatments (such as phenytoin, penicillin, and procainamide), and in the elderly.
When an individual has inappropriate blood clot formation, recurrent miscarriages, cardiolipin antibodies, and/or another antiphospholipid antibody, the person may be diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS can be primary or secondary. Primary APS is not necessarily associated with a related autoimmune disorder, while secondary APS is associated with an autoimmune disorder.

When you have had one or more unexplained blood clots (thrombotic episodes) in a vein or artery; when you have had recurrent miscarriages, especially in the second and third trimesters; when you have symptoms consistent with an autoimmune disease


","



Cardiolipin antibody testing is typically ordered as part of excessive clotting workup when an individual has symptoms suggestive of a blood clot (thrombotic episode), especially when they recur. Signs and symptoms vary, depending on the location of the clot.
If the clot is in the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis, DVT), a person may have symptoms such as:

Leg pain or tenderness, usually in one leg
Leg swelling, edema
Discoloration of the leg

If the clot is affecting the lungs (pulmonary embolism), a person may have symptoms such as:

Sudden shortness of breath, labored breathing
Coughing, hemoptysis (blood present in sputum)
Lung-related chest pain
Rapid heart rate

Testing may also be ordered when a woman has had recurrent miscarriages and/or ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing as a follow-up to a prolonged PTT test. When cardiolipin antibody is detected, then the test may be repeated several weeks later to determine whether the antibody is temporary or persistent.
The test for cardiolipin antibodies may also be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms of an autoimmune disorder and/or has a positive result on an ANA test, as the test may provide the healthcare practitioner with additional information to help establish a diagnosis. If cardiolipin antibodies are not detected in a person with a diagnosed autoimmune disorder such as lupus, then tests may be ordered in the future to screen for their development.



","



A negative result means only that cardiolipin antibodies are not present or not present at a detectable level in the blood at the time of the test.
Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies. It is not unusual to detect them in a person's blood temporarily due to an infection or drug, or in people without symptoms as they age. The low to moderate amounts of antibody seen in these situations are frequently not significant, but they must be evaluated in conjunction with any signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.
Moderate to high levels of cardiolipin antibodies that persist when tested again 12 weeks later indicate the likely continued presence of that specific antibody, which may be associated with an increased risk of excessive clotting or recurrent miscarriages.

Occasionally, cardiolipin testing may be ordered to help determine the cause of a positive VDRL/RPR test for syphilis. The reagents used to test for syphilis contain phospholipids and can cause a false-positive result in those with cardiolipin antibodies.

Tests for cardiolipin antibodies are frequently used to help determine the cause of:

An unexplained blood clot (thrombotic episode)
Recurrent miscarriages
A prolonged result on the coagulation (clotting test) PTT (partial thromboplastin time); in this setting, the test is often ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing (e.g., dilute Russell viper venom test, DRVVT)

If cardiolipin antibodies are detected on an initial test, then it is usually repeated 12 weeks later to help determine whether their presence is persistent or temporary. If a person with a known autoimmune disorder tests negative for cardiolipin antibodies, they may be retested later as these antibodies may develop at any time in the future.
There are three classes of cardiolipin antibodies that may be present in the blood: IgG, IgM and/or IgA. The two most commonly tested are IgG and IgM. However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then IgA cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered.
Some other tests that may be performed in conjunction with cardiolipin antibody tests include lupus anticoagulant testing (e.g., DRVVT) and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody.

These tests are affected by certain drugs, foods, and stresses. Tell your healthcare practitioner about any medications you are taking and follow any preparation instructions you are given before sample collection.

To help confirm or rule out a rare tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma or a rare tumor outside of the adrenal gland called a paraganglioma; these tumors (PPGL) produce excess catecholamines, which are broken down to metanephrines.


","

A 24-hour urine sample; sometimes a blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Catecholamines are a group of similar substances released into the blood in response to physical or emotional stress. The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamine testing measures the amounts of these hormones in the urine and/or blood. Urine testing is recommended over blood testing. Just the stress of having blood drawn can increase catecholamine blood levels, so results from blood tests are not as reliable as results from urine tests.
Catecholamines are produced in the adrenal medulla, the interior portion of the adrenal glands, and released into the blood. The adrenal glands are small, triangular organs located on top of each kidney. Catecholamines are also produced by cells of the sympathetic nervous system. They are released into the blood in response to physical and emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, causing increased blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and metabolism.
After completing their actions, catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Dopamine becomes homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine breaks down into normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and epinephrine becomes metanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Normally, catecholamines and their metabolites are present in the body in small, fluctuating amounts that only increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation. However, rare tumors called pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (collectively called PPGL) can produce large amounts of the hormones, resulting in increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. This can cause persistent or sudden bursts of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include heart palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and symptoms may worsen. Over time, the hypertension caused by the excess hormones may lead to kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk for stroke or heart attack.
It is important to diagnose and treat these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to significantly reduce the amount of catecholamines being produced and to reduce or eliminate their associated symptoms and complications.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For the urine test, a 24-hour urine collection is needed. All urine is saved for a 24-hour period. It is important that the sample be refrigerated during this time. A preservative is required and is usually provided with the collection container.
Blood for catecholamine testing is collected by inserting a needle into a vein. Although you may be seated for the collection, it is recommended that you be lying down. The healthcare practitioner or the collection site will instruct you as to their specific requirements.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Catecholamine levels are affected by certain drugs, foods, and stresses. Preparation for the test is important to ensure that an appropriate sample is collected and for correct interpretation of results. Follow any instructions given by the healthcare practitioner or the collection site or laboratory.

You should talk to your healthcare provider about prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs and supplements you are taking. It may be necessary to discontinue medications for some time prior to the test.
However, you should not stop taking any medications without consulting your healthcare practitioner. Your healthcare practitioner will work with you to identify potentially interfering substances and drug treatments and to determine which of them can be safely interrupted and which must be continued for your well-being.
You will also be instructed on what foods to avoid. Fasting may also be required prior to the blood sample collection.
Avoid emotional and physical stresses and vigorous exercise prior to and during sample collection as they can increase catecholamine release.

After or along with plasma free metanephrines and/or urine metanephrines tests and when your healthcare practitioner needs additional information about a possible tumor that produces catecholamines


","



Catecholamines testing may be ordered when tests for plasma free metanephrines and/or urine metanephrines are inconclusive and a healthcare practitioner needs more information about a possible tumor that produces catecholamines. It may be ordered when you have sudden bursts (paroxysms) of specific signs and symptoms (especially If you are younger than age 40). Signs and symptoms may include:

High blood pressure (hypertension), especially when you have hypertension that is not responding to treatment (people with PPGL are frequently resistant to conventional therapies)
Severe headaches
Sweating
Flushing
Rapid heart rate (palpitations)
Tremors


The tests may also be ordered when an adrenal or neuroendocrine tumor is detected during a scan conducted for another purpose or if you have a strong personal or family history of pheochromocytoma.
It may also be ordered at intervals when you have been previously treated for one of these tumors.



","



A high level of catecholamines in the blood and/or urine when you have signs and symptoms strongly suggests the presence of a tumor that produces catecholamines. It indicates that further investigation is needed. It is recommended that imaging studies be performed to locate the tumor once test results show clear evidence of such a tumor.
The test for catecholamines is very sensitive and false positives do occur. The test is affected by stress, drugs, smoking, and various foods such as caffeine-containing drinks and alcohol. If you have only moderately elevated levels, then your healthcare practitioner may re-evaluate your medications, diet, and stress level to look for interfering substances or conditions. Once these are resolved, you may then be tested again to determine whether the levels are still elevated and take appropriate action.
If catecholamine levels are elevated after you have been treated for such a tumor, then it is likely that either treatment was not fully effective or the tumor has returned and appropriate follow up is needed.
If the level of catecholamines is normal, then it is unlikely that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines. However, pheochromocytomas do not necessarily produce catecholamines at a constant rate. Therefore, if you have not had a recent episode of hypertension, your blood and urine catecholamine levels could be at normal or near normal levels even when a pheochromocytoma is present. If suspicion remains high, testing may be repeated.



","



While plasma and urine catecholamines tests can help detect and diagnose tumors that produce catecholamines, they cannot tell the location of the tumor, whether there is more than one, or whether or not the tumor is benign (although most are). The total amount of catecholamines produced will tend to increase as the tumor increases in size or number.
Although pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare, 25% occur in the setting of a hereditary syndrome associated with alterations in specific genes. These genetic syndromes have thus been identified as carrying an increased tumor risk. Examples include MEN-1 and MEN-2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, types 1 and 2) syndromes. (For more information on these, see Genetics Home Reference: Multiple endocrine neoplasia.)



",,"



Catecholamines testing may be used in follow up to plasma free metanephrines and/or urine metanephrines testing to help confirm or rule out rare tumors called pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. It also may be used to monitor for recurrence of these tumors. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas produce catecholamines in excess, so measuring the amount in the blood and/or urine may help detect the tumor.
The Endocrine Society recommends tests for plasma free metanephrines and urine metanephrines to help diagnose pheochromocytomas or paragangliomas. If results of those tests are inconclusive, then urine testing for catecholamines may be used to provide additional information. Blood catecholamine testing may sometimes be used, but it is not as reliable because the stress of having blood drawn can increase levels. However, your healthcare practitioner may select any one (or more than one) of these tests depending on your signs and symptoms, family history, and/or genetic profile.

Urine catecholamines testing measures the total amount of catecholamines released into the urine in 24 hours. Since the hormone levels may fluctuate significantly during this period, the urine test may detect excess episodic production that is missed with the blood test.
Catecholamine blood test may be useful when you have persistent hypertension or are currently experiencing a sudden burst (paroxysm) of hypertension. This is because the hormones do not stay long in the blood; they are used by the body and rapidly broken down (metabolized) and/or then eliminated.

Most often, this test is done to measure the strength of your immune system if you have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment; occasionally, it may be used with other conditions (see Common Questions below).


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



CD4 cells are white blood cells called T lymphocytes or T cells that fight infection and play an important role in immune system function. CD4 tests measure the number of these cells in the blood and, in conjunction with an HIV viral load test, help assess disease status in a person who has been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
CD4 cells are made in the thymus gland and they circulate throughout the body in the blood and lymphatic system. They are so called because they have markers on their surfaces called clusters of differentiation (CD). The CD number identifies the specific type of cell.
CD4 cells are sometimes called T-helper cells. They help to identify, attack, and destroy specific bacteria, fungi, and viruses that cause infections. CD4 cells are also a major target for HIV, which binds to the surface of CD4 cells, enters them, and either replicates immediately, killing the cells in the process, or remains in a resting state, replicating later.
If HIV goes untreated, the virus gets into the cells and replicates, the viral load increases, and the number of CD4 cells in the blood gradually declines. The CD4 count decreases as the disease progresses. If left untreated, this process may continue for several years until the number of CD4 cells drops to a low enough level that symptoms associated with AIDS begin to appear.
Treatment for HIV infection, called antiretroviral treatment (ART or ARV) or sometimes highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), typically involves taking a combination of drugs. This treatment reduces the amount of HIV (viral load) present in the body and reduces the risk of disease progression. When this occurs, the CD4 count will increase and/or stabilize.
CD4 counts can be variable, even in healthy individuals. To provide a clearer picture of the condition of the immune system, test results may also be reported as a CD4 percentage, which is the ratio of CD4 cells to total lymphocytes.
CD4 tests may be used occasionally in other conditions, such as lymphomas and organ transplantation (see Common Questions below).

When you are first diagnosed with HIV infection to get a baseline assessment of your immune system; about every 3 to 6 months after starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) to check whether you are responding to treatment; if you have responded well to treatment, you may then be tested every 6 to 12 months.


","



A CD4 count is usually ordered along with an HIV viral load when you are first diagnosed with HIV infection as part of a baseline measurement. After the baseline, a CD4 count will usually be ordered at intervals over time, depending on a few different factors.
The following table summarizes recommendations* for the timing of CD4 counts and viral load testing:



Clinical Status of Patient
Viral Load
CD4 Count


When first diagnosed
Test performed
Test performed


If ART is delayed
Optional
Every 3-6 months


After initiating ART
Within 2-4 weeks and then every 4-8 weeks until virus is suppressed (undetectable)
3 months later


During the first 2 years of stable ART
Every 3-4 months
Every 3-6 months


Virally suppressed on ART for greater than 2 years
Can extend to every 6 months
Annually; if CD4 consistently greater than 500 cells/mm3, monitoring is optional


While on ART and viral load is consistently greater than 200 copies/mL
Every 3 months
Every 3-6 months


With new HIV symptoms or start of new treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or cancer drugs
Every 3 months
Perform test and monitor according to health status (e.g., new HIV symptoms, opportunistic infections)



*Adapted from Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1–Infected Adults and Adolescents, Table 4. Recommendations on the Indications and Frequency of Viral Load and CD4 Count Monitoring.



","



A CD4 count is typically reported as a count of cells (expressed as cells per cubic millimeter of blood). Sometimes results are expressed as a percent of total lymphocytes (CD4 percent).

A normal CD4 count ranges from 500–1,200 cells/mm3 in adults and teens. In general, a normal CD4 count means that your immune system is not yet significantly affected by HIV infection.
A low CD4 count indicates that your immune system has been affected by HIV and/or the disease is progressing. At CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3, the immune system can no longer keep opportunistic infections in check. At low CD4 counts, a healthcare practitioner may recommend starting prophylactic treatment for opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis carinii (jiroveci) pneumonia (PCP) or candidiasis (thrush). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers people who have an HIV infection and CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm3 to have AIDS (stage III HIV infection), regardless of whether they have any signs or symptoms.


Once the virus has been suppressed due to ART, CD4 counts typically rise and/or stabilize over time, indicating that you are responding to treatment. Within the first year of treatment it is normal for the CD4 count to increase by 50-150 cells/mm3. However, a slower change in the CD4 count is typically not sufficient to change treatment. It is rare for the CD4 count to decline when the virus is suppressed due to ART.
Importantly, any single CD4 test result may differ from the last one even though your health status has not changed. Usually, a healthcare practitioner will take several CD4 test results into account rather than a single value and will evaluate the pattern of CD4 results over time.



","



The CD4 count tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Acute illnesses, such as pneumonia, influenza, or herpes simplex virus infection, can cause the CD4 count to decline temporarily. Cancer chemotherapy can dramatically lower the CD4 count.
The CD4 count does not always reflect how someone with HIV disease feels and functions. For example, some people with higher counts are ill and have frequent complications, and some people with lower CD4 counts have few medical complications and function well.



","



CD4 counts, along with an HIV viral load, are most often used if you are diagnosed with HIV infection to:

Predict whether the disease will worsen over time (progress)
Determine how quickly to start treatment or the need for treatment to prevent opportunistic infections (prophylaxis)
Evaluate the immune system
Monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment (ART or ARV), also called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)


It is recommended that all individuals diagnosed with HIV infection receive antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible, including pregnant women, to reduce the risk of disease progression. People typically take at least three drugs from two different classes in order to prevent or minimize virus replication and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Combinations of three or more antiretroviral drugs are referred to as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART.
CD4 counts are most useful when they are compared with results obtained from earlier tests. Since CD4 cells are usually destroyed more rapidly than other types of lymphocytes and because absolute counts can vary from day to day, it is sometimes useful to look at the number of CD4 cells compared to the total lymphocyte count. The result is expressed as a percentage, i.e., CD4 percent.
Sometimes, CD4 tests may be used to help diagnose or monitor other conditions such as lymphoma, organ transplantation, and DiGeorge syndrome (see below).

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an inappropriate immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, and related dietary proteins in rye and barley. Celiac disease antibody tests help diagnose and monitor the disease and a few other gluten-sensitive conditions. These tests detect autoantibodies in the blood that the body produces as part of the immune response.
This immune response leads to inflammation of the small intestine and to damage and destruction of the villi that line the intestinal wall. The villi are projections, small tissue folds that increase the surface area of the intestine and allow nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fluids, and electrolytes to be absorbed into the body. When a susceptible person is exposed to gluten, the person's body produces autoantibodies that act against constituents of the intestinal villi. When villi are damaged or destroyed, the body is much less capable of absorbing food and begins to develop signs and symptoms associated with malnutrition and malabsorption.
A tissue biopsy of the small intestine is still considered the gold standard to use to confirm a diagnosis of celiac disease, but the availability of less invasive blood tests to screen for celiac disease has reduced the number of biopsies needed.
See ""How is the test used?"" below for details on the tests.

","



Celiac disease tests are ordered when someone has signs and symptoms suggesting celiac disease, malnutrition, and/or malabsorption. The symptoms are often nonspecific and variable, making the disease difficult to spot. The symptoms may, for a time, be mild and go unnoticed and then progressively worsen or occur sporadically. The condition can affect different parts of the body.
Digestive signs and symptoms may include:

Abdominal pain and distension
Bloody stool
Chronic diarrhea or constipation
Flatulence
Greasy, foul-smelling stools
Vomiting
	 

Other signs and symptoms may include:

Iron-deficiency anemia that does not respond to iron supplements
Easy bruising and/or bleeding
Bone and joint pain
Defects in dental enamel
Fatigue, weakness
Mouth ulcers
Weight loss
In adults, infertility, osteoporosis
	 

In children, celiac disease tests may be ordered when a child exhibits:

Digestive tract symptoms
Delayed development
Short stature
Failure to thrive
	 

Many people with celiac disease have dermatitis herpetiformis, a disease that causes itchy blisters on the skin. There is also an increased risk for developing intestinal lymphoma, a form of cancer.
One or more antibody tests may be ordered when someone with celiac disease has been on a gluten-free diet for a period of time. This is done to verify that antibody levels have decreased and to verify that the diet has been effective in reversing the intestinal lining damage (this is sometimes still confirmed with a second biopsy).
Asymptomatic people may be tested if they have a close relative such as a parent or sibling with celiac disease, but celiac disease testing is not recommended at this time as a screen for the general population.

All positive and indeterminate celiac disease tests are typically followed by an intestinal biopsy. A biopsy is used to make a definitive diagnosis of celiac disease.
If you have been diagnosed with celiac disease and you eliminate gluten from your diet, then the autoantibody levels should fall. If they do not fall and the symptoms do not diminish, then there may either be hidden forms of gluten in the diet that have not been eliminated (gluten is often found in unexpected places, from salad dressings to cough syrup to the adhesive used on envelopes) or you may have one of the rare forms of celiac disease that does not respond to dietary changes.
If you have not consumed any gluten for several weeks to months prior to testing, then celiac disease tests may be negative. If your healthcare practitioner still suspects celiac disease, the practitioner may do a gluten challenge – have you introduce gluten back into your diet for several weeks or months to see if your symptoms return. At that time, celiac disease tests may be repeated or a biopsy may be done to check for damage to the villi in the intestine.



","



Although celiac disease is relatively common (about 1 in 100 to 150 people in the U.S. are thought to be affected), most people who have the disease are not aware of it. This is partly due to the fact that the symptoms are variable -- they may be mild or absent, even when intestinal damage is present on biopsied tissue. Since these symptoms may also be due to a variety of other conditions, a diagnosis of celiac disease may be missed or delayed, sometimes for years.



","



Celiac disease antibody tests are primarily used to help diagnose and monitor celiac disease in people with signs and symptoms, including anemia and abdominal pain.
Sometimes celiac testing may be used to screen for asymptomatic celiac disease in those who have close relatives with the disease since about 4-12% of them have or will develop celiac disease. Testing may also be ordered in those who have other autoimmune diseases.
Celiac disease blood tests measure the amount of particular antibodies in the blood. The most common tests include:

Tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG), IgA class — the primary test ordered to screen for celiac disease. It is the most sensitive and specific blood test for celiac disease and is the single test preferred by the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Gastroenterology Association for the detection of celiac disease in those over the age of 2 years. If the test is positive, it can also be used to monitor the condition and to help evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. (Although ""tissue"" is in the name of this test, it is measured in the blood.)
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) — this test is usually ordered along with the tTG IgA test (below) to detect IgA deficiency, which occurs in about 2-3% of people with celiac disease. If you have an IgA deficiency then the test for tTG IgA may be negative even if you have celiac disease (false-negative test results). If the IgA test shows you have an IgA deficiency, then a test to detect the IgG class of autoantibodies may be ordered (see below).
tTG, IgG may be used as an alternative test in people who have a deficiency of IgA.
Deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) antibodies (anti-DGP), IgA or IgG — may be used in some people with suspected celiac disease who are negative for anti-tTG, especially children younger than 2 years old. DGP IgG testing along with anti-tTG IgG is recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology for people who have low IgA or IgA deficiency. If the anti-DGP test is positive, it may be used to monitor celiac disease.
	 

Tests that are used less often include:

Anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) -— antibodies developed in reaction to the ongoing damage to the intestinal lining; it has been found that tTg is the substance detected in this test. Almost 100% of people with active celiac disease and 70% of those with dermatitis herpetiformis (another gluten-sensitive condition that causes an itchy, burning, blistering rash on the skin) will have the IgA class of anti-EMA antibodies. The test is more difficult to do and interpret properly than anti-tTg so it is used less often.
Anti-reticulin antibody (ARA) test — not as specific or sensitive as the other autoantibodies; it is found in about 60% of people with celiac disease and about 25% of those with dermatitis herpetiformis; it is rarely ordered.
	 

To confirm a diagnosis of celiac disease, a biopsy of the small intestine is examined to detect damage to the intestinal villi. However, given the invasive nature and cost of a biopsy, antibody tests are often used to identify those individuals with high probability of having celiac disease.

You will be instructed to empty your bladder and bowels prior to sample collection. It will be necessary to lie still in a curled-up fetal position during the collection and to lie flat and still for a time period after the collection. (For additional details, see ""What is a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) and how is it performed?"" in the Common Questions section.)

To diagnose a disease or condition affecting the central nervous system such as infection, bleeding around the brain, cancer, or autoimmune disorder


","

A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected by a healthcare practitioner from the lower back using a procedure called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap


","



Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear, watery liquid that flows around the brain and spinal cord, surrounding and protecting them. CSF testing is performed to evaluate the level or concentration of different substances and cells in CSF in order to diagnose conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system).
CSF is produced and secreted by the choroid plexus, a special tissue that has many blood vessels and that lines the small cavities or chambers (ventricles) in the brain. The total CSF volume is 3-5 ounces (90-150 mL) in adults and 0.3-2 ounces (10-60 mL) in newborns. CSF is continually produced, circulated, and then absorbed into the blood. About 17 ounces (500 mL) of CSF are produced each day. This rate of production means that all the CSF is replaced every few hours.
A protective, semi-permeable barrier separates the brain from the bloodstream. This blood-brain barrier allows some substances to cross and prevents other substances from crossing. Importantly, it helps keep large molecules, toxins, and most blood cells away from the central nervous system. Any condition that disrupts this protective barrier may result in a change in the normal level or makeup of CSF. Because CSF surrounds the brain and spinal cord, testing a sample of CSF can be very valuable in diagnosing a variety of conditions affecting the central nervous system.
Although a sample of CSF may be more difficult to obtain than, for example, urine or blood, the results of CSF testing may reveal more directly the cause of central nervous system conditions. The following are some examples:

Meningitis, an infection of the layers that cover the brain and spinal cord (meninges), and encephalitis, an infection in the brain
Autoimmune diseases that affect the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis
Cancers of the central nervous system or cancers that have spread to the central nervous system, such as leukemia
Alzheimer disease, an irreversible form of dementia

When your healthcare provider suspects that your symptoms are due to a condition or disease involving your central nervous system


","



CSF testing may be ordered when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a condition or disease involving your central nervous system. It may be ordered when:

You have suffered trauma to the brain or spinal cord
You have been diagnosed with cancer that may have spread into the central nervous system
Your medical history and/or signs or symptoms suggest a condition affecting your central nervous system. The signs and symptoms of central nervous system conditions can vary widely and many overlap with a variety of diseases and disorders. They may have sudden onset, suggesting an acute condition, such as central nervous system bleeding or infection, or may be slow to develop, indicating a chronic disease, such as multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer disease.

CSF testing may be ordered when you have some combination of the following signs and symptoms, especially when accompanied by flu-like symptoms that intensify over a few hours to a few days and fever:

Changes in mental status and consciousness
Sudden, severe or persistent headache or a stiff neck
Confusion, hallucinations or seizures
Muscle weakness or lethargy, fatigue
Nausea (severe or prolonged)
Sensitivity to light
Numbness or tremor
Dizziness
Difficulties with speech
Difficulty walking, lack of coordination
Mood swings, depression
Infants may be increasingly irritable, cry when they are held, have body stiffness, refuse food, and have bulging fontanels (the soft spots on the top of the head)




","



CSF usually contains a small amount of protein and glucose and may have a few white blood cells.
Any condition that disrupts the normal pressure or flow of CSF or the protective ability of the blood-brain barrier can result in abnormal results of CSF testing. For detailed explanations of what various test results may mean, see the section below, Details on CSF Tests



","



To help diagnose a central nervous system-related illness, a healthcare provider may want to know about recent vaccinations, sickness, contact with others who are ill, places you have traveled, signs and symptoms, and their duration.



","



Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing may be used to help diagnose a wide variety of diseases and conditions affecting the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Some examples include:

Infections, such as meningitis and encephalitis—testing is used to determine if infection is caused by bacteria, viruses or, less commonly, by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, fungi or parasites, and to distinguish them from other conditions. CSF testing may also be used to detect infections of or near the spinal cord. 
Bleeding (hemorrhaging) around the brain
Autoimmune disorders that affect the central nervous system, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome or multiple sclerosis
Tumors located within the central nervous system (primary) or cancers that spread to the central nervous system (metastatic cancer)
Alzheimer disease, an irreversible form of dementia

CSF testing usually involves an initial, basic set of tests performed when CSF analysis is requested:

CSF color, clarity and pressure during CSF collection
CSF protein
CSF glucose
CSF cell count (total number of cells present)
CSF differential cell count (numbers of different types of cells present)
If infection is suspected, CSF Gram stain, routine culture and molecular tests that detect the genetic material of any microbes present

A wide variety of other tests may be ordered as follow-up depending on the results of the first set of tests or the suspected diagnosis. The specific tests that are ordered depend on your signs and symptoms and the disease your healthcare practitioner suspects may be the cause. Each of these tests can be grouped according to the type of exam that is performed. For more, see Details on CSF Tests below.

To measure the amount of ceruloplasmin in your blood; to help diagnose Wilson disease; sometimes to help identify conditions associated with copper deficiencies


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Ceruloplasmin is a copper-containing enzyme that plays a role in the body's iron metabolism. This test measures the amount of ceruloplasmin in the blood.
Copper is an essential mineral that plays a role in the regulation of iron metabolism, formation of connective tissue, energy production within cells, and the function of the nervous system. It is absorbed from food and liquids by the intestines and then transported to the liver, where it is stored or used to produce a variety of enzymes.
The liver binds copper to a protein to produce ceruloplasmin and then releases it into the bloodstream. About 95% of the copper in the blood is bound to ceruloplasmin. Because of this, the ceruloplasmin test can be used along with one or more copper tests to help diagnose Wilson disease, an inherited disorder that can lead to excess storage of copper in the eyes, liver, brain, and other organs.

","

When you have jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, behavioral changes, tremors, or other symptoms that a healthcare practitioner thinks may be due to Wilson disease or, rarely, to copper deficiency; periodically when monitoring is recommended


","



A ceruloplasmin test may be ordered alone or along with blood and 24-hour urine copper tests when you have signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to Wilson disease, such as:

Anemia
Nausea, abdominal pain
Jaundice
Fatigue
Behavioral changes
Tremors
Difficulty walking
Persistent involuntary muscle contractions that cause repetitive or twisting motions (dystonia)
Diarrhea and vomiting
Trouble swallowing or speaking
Dark brown rings around the iris of the eyes (Kayser-Fleischer rings)

Rarely, ceruloplasmin may also be ordered along with copper tests when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a copper deficiency. Symptoms of a copper deficiency include pale skin, osteoporosis, fatigue, and tingling in the hands and feet. Infants may be tested if they have signs of Menkes kinky hair syndrome, which include brittle, sparse or tangled hair, feeding problems, failure to grow, seizures, developmental delays, or low muscle tone.
Ceruloplasmin may be ordered periodically to monitor copper excess or deficiency and periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.



","



Ceruloplasmin levels are not diagnostic of a specific condition and are usually evaluated along with copper tests.
Test results may include:

*Excess copper in the liver is often unevenly distributed and may not be detected in a sample.

Decreased ceruloplasmin and blood copper concentrations and increased urine copper levels may indicate Wilson disease.
Some people with Wilson disease who have neurological symptoms will have normal ceruloplasmin levels, as will many people with symptoms of liver damage, especially if they are acutely ill.
If ceruloplasmin and urine and/or blood copper concentrations are low, then the person tested may have a copper deficiency.
Anything that interferes with the supply of copper or with the body's ability to metabolize copper has the potential to affect blood ceruloplasmin and copper concentrations.
Higher-than-normal ceruloplasmin levels could be a sign of a serious infection, heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis, leukemia or Hodgkin lymphoma.




","



Ceruloplasmin may be increased in a variety of circumstances where the test is not used as a clinical tool. However, these conditions can affect interpretation of the test and the ability to recognize Wilson disease or copper deficiency. These may include the following:

Ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant. It is frequently elevated with inflammation, severe infection, tissue damage, and may be increased with some cancers.
It may be increased during pregnancy and with the use of estrogen, oral contraceptives, and medications such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and valproic acid.

Falsely low ceruloplasmin levels could occur in any condition that causes protein deficiency, such as nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption, loss of protein from the digestive tract (protein-losing enteropathy), and malnutrition.



","



Ceruloplasmin testing is used primarily, along with blood and/or urine copper tests, to help diagnose Wilson disease, a rare inherited disorder associated with excess storage of copper in the eyes, liver, brain, and other organs, and with decreased levels of ceruloplasmin.
Rarely, a ceruloplasmin test may be ordered with a copper test to help diagnose abnormal copper metabolism, copper deficiencies, or the rare inherited disorder Menkes kinky hair syndrome (see below).

None


","

To diagnose, as necessary, a current, recent, or past case of chickenpox or shingles; to determine whether you have developed immunity to the varicella zoster virus (VZV) or whether there is the potential for reactivating a VZV infection prior to receiving immunosuppressive drugs


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm for VZV antibody testing; to detect the virus itself, a sample of fluid from a blister (vesicle), blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or other body fluid or tissue


","



Chickenpox and shingles are caused by an infection with the varicella zoster virus (VZV), a member of the herpes virus family. Varicella zoster virus tests detect either antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a VZV infection or detect the virus itself.
Tests for chickenpox and shingles may be performed to detect and diagnose a current or past infection with VZV. Most often, testing is not necessary to diagnosis an active infection because it can be made from clinical signs and symptoms, but in some people with atypical skin lesions, a diagnostic test helps to confirm the infection. In some people, especially organ transplant recipients and pregnant women, the tests may be used to diagnose a current infection or to determine whether or not they have developed immunity from prior infection or by vaccination.
Before the introduction and widespread use of a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, nearly everyone in the United States became infected by VZV by adulthood. While VZV is present in its latent form in many adults who were infected as children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incidence of new cases of chickenpox has declined significantly. Two doses of the vaccine are about 98% effective in preventing the infection, and those who do become infected usually have milder symptoms.
Varicella zoster virus can cause chickenpox in the young and in adults who have not been vaccinated or previously exposed. The primary infection is highly contagious, passing from person to person through coughing or sneezing or touching fluid from blisters. In a primary infection, signs and symptoms include an itchy rash that emerges about two weeks after exposure to the virus, followed by the formation of pimple-like papules that become small, fluid-filled blisters (vesicles). The vesicles break, form a crust, and then heal. This process occurs in two or three waves or ""crops"" of several hundred vesicles over a few days. 
Once the initial infection has resolved, the virus becomes latent, persisting in sensory nerve cells. The person develops  antibodies during the infection that usually prevent them from getting chickenpox again. However, later in life and in those with weakened immune systems, the virus can reactivate, migrating down the nerve cells to the skin, causing shingles (also known as herpes zoster).
Symptoms of shingles include a mild to intense burning or itching pain in a band of skin at the waist, the face, or another location. It is usually in one place on one side of the body but can also occur in multiple locations. Several days after the pain, itching, or tingling begins, a rash, with or without vesicles, forms in the same location. In most people, the rash and pain subside within a few weeks, and the virus again becomes latent. A few may have pain that lingers for several months.
A shingles vaccine is now available for older adults. This vaccine lowers the risk of the virus reactivating as shingles and lessens the severity of the symptoms if shingles do occur. In 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) began recommending a shingles vaccination for all adults aged 60 years and older. However, the vaccine is not recommended for those who have weakened immune systems.
Most cases of chickenpox and shingles resolve without complications. In people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients, the disease can be more severe and long-lasting. In some cases, it may not become latent and may spread to the central nervous system.
In pregnant women, the effects of exposure to VZV on a developing baby or newborn depend on when it occurs and on whether or not the mother has been previously exposed. In the first 20 to 30 weeks of pregnancy, a primary VZV infection may, rarely, cause congenital abnormalities in the unborn baby. If the infection occurs one to three weeks before delivery, the baby may be born with or acquire chickenpox after birth, although the baby may be partially protected by the mother's antibodies. If a newborn is exposed to VZV at birth and does not have maternal antibody protection, then the VZV infection can be fatal.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The sample required depends on whether testing is being done to determine the presence of antibodies or to detect the virus itself and on the health status of the person. Antibody testing requires a blood sample drawn from a vein in the arm. Viral detection may be done on a variety of samples, including a sample of vesicle fluid, blood, cerebrospinal fluid, other body fluid, or tissue.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have atypical and/or severe symptoms and your healthcare practitioner wants to distinguish between a VZV infection and another cause; when a healthcare practitioner wants to check whether or not you are immune to VZV; sometimes prior to an organ transplant or when a child, pregnant woman, or a person with a weakened immune system has been exposed to someone with chickenpox


","



VZV antibody tests may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to check whether a person has developed immunity to VZV, especially someone who is at high risk, such as an organ transplant recipient or a pregnant woman, and/or when a healthcare practitioner wants to identify a recent infection.
VZV culture or DNA tests may be ordered when a person at risk, such as a newborn or immunocompromised person, has been exposed to VZV and is ill with atypical and/or severe symptoms – to detect an active primary VZV infection in the baby or a primary or reactivated infection in the immunocompromised person.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting the results of VZV testing. The healthcare practitioner evaluates the results in conjunction with clinical findings. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between a latent and active VZV infection. This is possible for several reasons, including:

A healthy person who has been infected with VZV will continue to harbor the virus after the symptoms disappear. The VZV can reactivate intermittently, shedding small amounts of virus into body fluids but not causing symptoms.
An infant or immunocompromised person may not have a strong antibody response to the VZV infection – their IgM and IgG levels may be lower than expected even though the person has an active case of VZV.
The virus may not be present in sufficient number in the particular fluid or tissue tested to be detected.

Antibody detection
If both VZV IgG and IgM are present in a symptomatic person, then it is likely that the person has either recently been exposed to VZV for the first time and has chickenpox or that the previous VZV infection has been reactivated and the person has shingles.
If only IgM is present, then the infection may have been very recent. If a newborn has IgM antibodies, then the baby has a congenital VZV infection. If a person is symptomatic but has low or undetectable levels of IgG and/or IgM, it may mean that the person either has a condition other than VZV or that the person's immune system is not responding normally – not producing a detectable level of VZV antibody.
Viral detection
If someone is symptomatic and the culture is positive for varicella zoster virus, then the person likely has an active VZV infection. If the culture is negative, then the person's symptoms may be due to another cause or the VZV virus is not detectable in the sample tested.
If a test for VZV DNA is positive, then VZV is present. High levels of viral DNA tend to indicate an active infection. Low levels indicate a VZV infection but may not indicate a symptomatic condition. Negative results do not rule out VZV infection – the virus may be present in very low numbers or may not be present in the body sample tested.



","



VZV may rarely cause encephalitis, a serious complication.



","



Laboratory tests are not routinely used to diagnose active cases of chickenpox and shingles, which are caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). These conditions are usually diagnosed based upon a person's signs and symptoms. Most adults have been infected with VZV, and children are now vaccinated; therefore, general population screening is not done. However, testing for VZV or for the antibodies produced in response to VZV infection may be performed in certain cases. For example, it may sometimes be performed in pregnant women, in newborns, in people prior to organ transplantation, and in those with HIV/AIDS. Testing may be used to:

Determine if someone has been previously exposed to VZV either through past infection or vaccination and has developed immunity to the disease
Distinguish between an active or prior infection
Determine whether someone with severe or atypical symptoms has an active VZV infection or has another condition with similar symptoms

There are several methods of testing for VZV:
Antibody testing
When someone is exposed to VZV, the person's immune system responds by producing antibodies to the virus. Laboratory tests can detect and measure the level of two classes of VZV antibodies in the blood: IgM and IgG.

IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to a VZV infection. They are present in most individuals within a week or two after the initial exposure. IgM antibody production rises for a short time period and declines. Eventually, the level (titer) of VZV IgM antibody usually falls below detectable levels. Additional IgM may be produced when latent VZV is reactivated.
IgG antibodies are produced by the body several weeks after the initial VZV infection and provide long-term protection. Levels of IgG rise during the active infection, then stabilize as the VZV infection resolves and the virus becomes inactive.

Once a person has been exposed to VZV, that person will have some measurable amount of VZV IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their life. VZV IgG antibody testing can be used, along with IgM testing, to help confirm the presence of a recent or previous VZV infection.
Viral detection
Viral detection involves finding VZV in a blood, fluid, or tissue sample. This can be done either by culturing the virus or by detecting the virus’s genetic material (VZV DNA).

VZV DNA testing – performed to detect VZV genetic material in a person's sample. This method is sensitive. It can identify and measure the amount of the virus.
Direct Fluorescent Antibody (DFA) – this test visualizes the presence of VZV in the cells taken from a person's skin lesion using a special microscope and labeled antibody. It is rapid, but less specific and sensitive than DNA testing.
VZV culture – culture is not very reliable for VZV and can lead to false-negative results.

The choice of tests and samples collected depends on the person, their symptoms, and on the healthcare practitioner's clinical findings.

Tell your healthcare practitioner about any use of antibiotics or, if you are a woman, douches or vaginal creams. You may be asked to avoid using these within 24 hours before testing vaginal samples since they may affect test results. Menstruation will not affect results. You may be instructed to wait one to two hours after you last urinated before collecting a urine sample. Follow any instructions you are given.

To screen for and diagnose a chlamydia infection


","

For women, vaginal swabs are the optimal sample for genital chlamydia testing. A healthcare practitioner may use a swab or small brush to collect a sample of cells or fluid from your vagina during a pelvic examination. Sometimes, you may collect your own vaginal sample for testing (self-collection).
For men, a healthcare practitioner may use a swab to collect a sample from your urethra, the tube within your penis that allows urine to flow from your bladder.
Urine samples can be used to test both men and women. As you begin to urinate, collect the initial portion of your urine stream (first-catch) in a container provided by the healthcare practitioner or laboratory.
Sometimes, a healthcare practitioner may use a swab or brush to collect a sample from other areas that may be infected, such as the rectum, throat or eye.


","



Chlamydia is one of the most common bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in the United States and can cause serious complications if not treated. Chlamydia testing identifies the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis as the cause of your infection.
The preferred method for chlamydia testing is the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) that detects the genetic material (DNA) of Chlamydia trachomatis. It is generally more sensitive and specific than other chlamydia tests and can be performed on a vaginal swab on women or urine from both men and women, which eliminates the need for a pelvic exam in women.
Screening for, diagnosing, and treating chlamydia is very important in preventing long-term complications and spread of the infection to others. Chlamydia infections are especially common among people 15 to 24 years of age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 2.86 million Americans are infected with chlamydia each year and notes that women are frequently re-infected if their partners don't get treatment. The actual number of cases may be higher since many people do not experience any symptoms and do not get tested and diagnosed. Still, over one million new cases are reported each year.
Chlamydia is generally spread through sexual contact (oral, vaginal, or anal) with an infected partner. Risk factors include having multiple sex partners, infection with another STD at the same time or previous STD infection, and not using a condom correctly and consistently.
Many people with chlamydia infections have no symptoms and some may experience only mild symptoms. Signs and symptoms of chlamydia are similar to and can be confused with those cause by another STD, gonorrhea, so tests for these infections are often done at the same time.
Chlamydia is easily treated with a course of antibiotics. If not diagnosed and treated, it can cause severe reproductive and other health problems.
In women, untreated chlamydia infections can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) from infections that start on the cervix but spread to the fallopian tubes and ovaries. This can cause:

Long-term (chronic) pelvic pain
Infertility
An increased risk of tubal (ectopic) pregnancy, which can be fatal

If you are infected while pregnant, you may experience premature labor, premature rupture of the membranes and your baby may be born with a low birth weight. You can pass the infection to your baby during childbirth. Infected babies are at risk of developing complications such as pneumonia or conjunctivitis, an inflammation that, left untreated, can threaten eyesight.
Rarely, men who are not treated may experience infertility.

For women, yearly screening is recommended if you are sexually active and younger than age 25, or 25 or older and at increased risk for chlamydia infection; when you are pregnant or considering pregnancy.
For men, yearly screening is recommended if you are a man who has sex with men.
When you have symptoms of chlamydia, such as pain during urination, vaginal discharge and abdominal pain (for women) or unusual discharge from the penis, pain on urination or painful, swollen testicles (for men)
When your newborn has conjunctivitis



","



Screening
Because many infected people do not have any noticeable symptoms, a number of health organizations recommend regular chlamydia screening for certain people:
Women
All sexually active women younger than age 25 and sexually active women age 25 and older who are at increased risk should get yearly screening for chlamydia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Academy of Pediatrics also recommend routine screening for these women (the USPSTF says age 24 and younger).
Examples of risk factors for chlamydia infection include:

Previous chlamydia infections, even if you have been treated
Having STDs, especially HIV
Having new or multiple sex partners
Having a sex partner diagnosed with an STD
Using condoms inconsistently
Exchanging sex for money or drugs
Using illegal drugs
Living in a detention facility

For pregnant women, the CDC recommends screening for chlamydia during the first trimester or first prenatal visit. For women younger than age 25 or at increased risk of infection, testing is repeated in the third trimester. Pregnant women diagnosed with chlamydia should be retested about 3 months after completing treatment. (See Pregnancy for more information.)
Men
The CDC recommends that men who have sex with men get chlamydia screening at least annually. Health organizations do not recommend routine screening for sexually active, heterosexual men with no symptoms. However, your healthcare practitioner may recommend screening if there is a high number of cases (prevalence) of STDs in your community.
Diagnosis
Chlamydia testing may also be done when your sex partner has been diagnosed with chlamydia or when you have signs and symptoms of chlamydia.
For women, if symptoms occur, they may include:

Bleeding between your menstrual periods and after sexual intercourse
Abdominal pain
Pain during sex
Pain while urinating and/or urinating more often
Abnormal vaginal discharge

For men, symptoms may include:

Pus or milky discharge from your penis
Pain when urinating and/or urinating more often
Pain, tenderness and swelling of your testicles

Both men and women can get an infection in their rectum and may be tested when they have symptoms such as itching, inflammation, pain, discharge and/or bleeding from the rectum.
Testing for both chlamydia and gonorrhea may be done when your newborn has symptoms of conjunctivitis, such as redness and swelling of the eye, and discharge.
Women or men treated for chlamydia should be retested three months after their treatment.



","



A positive test indicates you have an active chlamydia infection that requires treatment with antibiotics.
A negative test means only that there is no evidence of infection at the time of the test. If you are at an increased risk, it is important that you have screening tests performed yearly to check for possible infection, especially since re-infection is common, particularly among teenagers.
If you are infected, your sexual partner(s) should be tested and treated as well.



","



The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the NAAT testing method for chlamydia, except in cases of child sexual abuse in boys or rectal and oral infections in preteen girls. In these cases, culture is recommended.



","



Chlamydia testing is used to screen for and diagnose sexually transmitted infections caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis.
Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea) is often done at the same time since the infections caused by these two bacteria can have similar signs and symptoms. These bacteria may be acquired at the same time, and you may have infections with both. A definitive diagnosis is important since the two infections require different antibiotic treatment.
Repeat testing is recommended to ensure that treatment has been effective. This is done about three months after you have completed treatment.

To determine if there is a problem with your body's electrolyte balance or acid-base (pH) balance and to monitor treatment; as part of a routine health checkup


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm; sometimes as a random or 24-hour urine sample


","



Chloride is an electrolyte. It is a negatively charged ion that works with other electrolytes, such as potassium, sodium, and bicarbonate, to help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. This test measures the level of chloride in the blood and/or urine.
Chloride is present in all body fluids but is found in the highest concentration in the blood and in the fluid outside of the body's cells. Most of the time, chloride concentrations mirror those of sodium, increasing and decreasing for the same reasons and in direct relationship to sodium. When there is an acid-base imbalance, however, blood chloride levels can change independently of sodium levels as chloride acts as a buffer. It helps to maintain electrical neutrality at the cellular level by moving into or out of the cells as needed.
We get chloride in our diet through food and table salt, which is made up of sodium and chloride ions. Most of the chloride is absorbed by the digestive tract, and the excess is eliminated in urine. The normal blood level remains steady, with a slight drop after meals (because the stomach produces acid after eating, using chloride from blood).

As part of a standard electrolyte panel or metabolic panel or when your healthcare practitioner thinks that your signs and symptoms may be due to an electrolyte imbalance


","



The blood chloride test is almost never ordered by itself. It is usually ordered as part of an electrolyte panel, a basic metabolic panel, or a comprehensive metabolic panel, which are ordered frequently as part of a routine physical.
Chloride, as part of an electrolyte or metabolic panel, may be ordered when acidosis or alkalosis is suspected or when you have an acute condition with symptoms that may include the following:

Prolonged vomiting and/or diarrhea
Weakness, fatigue
Difficulty breathing (respiratory distress)

Electrolytes may be ordered at regular intervals when you have a disease or condition or are taking a medication that can cause an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte panels or basic metabolic panels are commonly ordered on a regular basis when you are being treated for certain conditions, including high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, or liver or kidney disease.
A urine chloride test may be performed along with a blood or urine sodium when evaluating the cause of low or high blood chloride levels. A healthcare practitioner will look at whether the chloride measurement changes mirror those of the sodium. This helps the healthcare practitioner determine if there is also an acid-base imbalance and helps to guide treatment.



","



Chloride levels are typically interpreted along with results from other tests done at the same time, such as the results of other electrolyte tests. Low and high chloride levels can be caused by various conditions and diseases.
An increased level of blood chloride (called hyperchloremia) usually indicates dehydration, but can also occur with other problems that cause high blood sodium, such as Cushing syndrome or kidney disease. Increased blood chloride may also occur when too much base is lost from the body (producing metabolic acidosis) or when you hyperventilate (causing respiratory alkalosis).
A decreased level of blood chloride (called hypochloremia) may occur with any disorder that causes low blood sodium. Low chloride may also occur with congestive heart failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, aldosterone deficiency, prolonged vomiting or gastric suction, Addison disease, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases (causing respiratory acidosis), and with loss of acid from the body (called metabolic alkalosis).
An increased level of urine chloride can indicate dehydration, starvation, Addison disease, or consuming increased amounts of salt.
A decreased level of urine chloride can be seen with Cushing syndrome, primary aldosteronism, congestive heart failure, malabsorption syndrome, and diarrhea.

Drugs that affect sodium blood levels will also cause changes in chloride. In addition, swallowing large amounts of baking soda or substantially more than the recommended dosage of antacids can also cause low blood chloride.



","



A chloride blood test is used to detect an abnormal level of chloride. It is often used, along with other electrolytes, as part of a routine health exam to screen for a variety of conditions.
Chloride and other electrolyte tests may also be used to help diagnose the cause of signs and symptoms such as prolonged vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and difficulty breathing (respiratory distress). If an electrolyte imbalance is detected, your healthcare practitioner will look for and address the disease, condition, or medication causing the imbalance and may use a series of electrolyte tests to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. If an acid-base imbalance is suspected, your healthcare practitioner may also order tests for blood gases to further evaluate the severity and cause of the imbalance.
Urine chloride tests may be used by your healthcare practitioner to determine whether the cause of alkalosis (too much base) is loss of salt (in cases of dehydration, vomiting, or use of diuretics, where urine chloride would be very low) or an excess of certain hormones such as cortisol or aldosterone that can affect electrolyte elimination.

Cholinesterases are enzymes that are involved in helping the nervous system to function properly. There are two separate cholinesterase enzymes in the body: (1) acetylcholinesterase, found in red blood cells as well as in the lungs, spleen, nerve endings, and the gray matter of the brain, and (2) pseudocholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase), found in the serum as well as the liver, muscle, pancreas, heart, and white matter of the brain. Cholinesterase tests measure the activity of these enzymes.
Acetylcholinesterase is involved in transmission of nerve impulses by breaking down acetylcholine, a chemical that helps to transmit signals across nerve endings. A decrease in the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase results in excess acetylcholine at nerve endings. This can lead to overstimulation of nerves within body tissues and organs. Pseudochlinesterase is involved in processing and metabolizing drugs.
The two most common reasons for testing activity levels in the blood are:

Organophosphate pesticide exposure. Insecticides containing organophosphates can inhibit cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase activity. Symptoms can be severe with acute exposure to these pesticides or can gradually appear with chronic exposure. Absorption can occur by inhalation, ingestion, or contact with the skin. Testing red blood cell acetylcholinesterase and serum pseudocholinesterase may be done to detect acute poisoning or to monitor those with occupational exposure to these chemicals, such as farm workers or those who work with industrial chemicals.
Inherited pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Some individuals have an inherited deficiency due to a genetic variant of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase. This enzyme is used by the body to inactivate (metabolize) succinylcholine, a muscle relaxant that is commonly used during surgery. People who have low levels or defective pseudocholinesterase may experience prolonged effects of the drug, with protracted muscle paralysis and apnea following anesthesia. In addition, those who are homozygous for genetic variants may be at greater risk of adverse effects than those who are heterozygous. Pseudocholinesterase testing can be performed prior to surgery on those with a family history of prolonged apnea after use of succinylcholine to determine if they are at risk of complications related to this drug.

When you have symptoms of pesticide poisoning or on a regular basis when you are at risk of exposure to organophosphates, such as through work in the agriculture industry and/or frequent use of organophosphate insecticides
When you or a close relative have experienced prolonged apnea and muscle paralysis after use of the drug succinylcholine for a surgical operation



","



People who work with organophosphate compounds in the farming or chemical industries may be routinely monitored to assess any adverse exposure, once baseline levels have been established. Cholinesterase testing can also be used to assess any acute exposure to these compounds, which can cause neuromuscular damage. Toxicity can follow a rapid absorption of the compound in the lungs, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. The symptoms of toxicity are varied depending on the compound, quantity, and the site of exposure. Early symptoms may include:

Headache, dizziness
Nausea
Excessive tearing in the eyes, sweating and/or salivation

As the effects of the poisoning worsen, some additional symptoms may appear:

Vomiting, diarrhea
Dark or blurred vision due to constricted pupils
Muscle weakness, twitching, lack of coordination
Slowed breathing leading to respiratory failure, requiring lifesaving ventilation
In serious cases, seizures, coma, and death

Pre-operative screening for pseudocholinesterase activity is advised if a person or a close relative has experienced prolonged paralysis and apnea after the use of succinylcholine for anesthesia during an operation.



","



In monitoring for occupational pesticide exposure
Following exposure to organophosphate compounds, AChE and PChE activity can fall to about 80% of normal before any symptoms occur and drop to 40% of normal before the symptoms become severe. Those who are regularly exposed to these compounds may be monitored for toxic exposure by establishing a baseline activity level and then testing on a regular basis to watch for a significant reduction on activity of acetylcholinesterase or pseudocholinesterase.
In testing for acute pesticide exposure/poisoning
Significantly decreased cholinesterase activity levels usually indicate excessive absorption of organophosphate compounds. Pseudocholinesterase and RBC acetylcholinesterase activity are usually decreased within a few minutes to hours after exposure. Pseudocholinesterase activity may regenerate in a few days to weeks, while acetylcholinesterase activity will remain low for as long as one to three months. Both plasma and RBC activities are immediately affected by pesticide exposure but, upon removal from exposure, AChE and PChE regenerate at different rates since AChE is produced in blood cells, which have a lifespan of 120 days, whereas PChE is produced in the liver, with a half-life of about two weeks.
In testing for succinylcholine sensitivity
About 3% of people have low activity levels of pseudocholinesterase due to an inherited deficiency and will have prolonged effects from the muscle relaxant succinylcholine. Total quantitative pseudocholinesterase levels will be evaluated prior to surgery for patients with a history or family history of prolonged apnea after use of this drug. Low activity levels of pseudocholinesterase levels indicate that these people may be at increased risk of experiencing prolonged effects of the muscle relaxant. A second test, the dibucaine inhibition test, may also be performed to help characterize the degree of a person's sensitivity to the drug. The lower the result from a dibucaine inhibition test, the greater the risk of drug sensitivity.
Reduced cholinesterase levels can also be caused by chronic liver disease and malnutrition. Total cholinesterase activity can be lowered in a number of other conditions, including pregnancy, renal disease, shock, and some cancers.



","



If someone unexpectedly has prolonged apnea after surgery, testing for succinylcholine sensitivity may be performed; however, the sample should be obtained after 24 to 48 hours have elapsed following the surgery to avoid interference by any drugs given during the surgery that could affect the results.
Drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors may have a moderate benefit in those with early diagnosed Alzheimer disease.



",,"



Cholinesterase testing has two main uses:

It can be used to detect and diagnose organophosphate pesticide exposure and/or poisoning. It may also be used to monitor those who may be at increased risk of exposure to organophosphate compounds, such as those who work in agricultural and chemical industries, and to monitor those who are being treated for exposure. Typically, tests for red blood cell acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and serum pseudocholinesterase (PChE) are used for this purpose.
It can be used several days prior to a surgical procedure to determine if someone with a history of or family history of post-operative paralysis following the use of succinylcholine, a common muscle relaxant used for anesthesia, is at risk of having this reaction. In these cases, the test for pseudocholinesterase is usually used. A second test, referred to as a dibucaine inhibition test, may be done to help determine the extent to which the activity of the enzyme is decreased.

To help diagnose and monitor carcinoid tumors and other neuroendocrine tumors and assess the response to these tumors' treatments


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Chromogranin A (CgA) is a protein released from neuroendocrine cells. These are cells that release hormones in response to signals from the nervous system. They are found in organs throughout the body. This test measures the amount of chromogranin A in the blood.
Neuroendocrine cells, and the endocrine glands that they are found in, can give rise to a variety of tumors, both benign and malignant. Examples include carcinoid tumors, insulinomas, small cell lung cancers, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas, some pituitary tumors, and neuroblastomas. The CgA test may be used to aid in detection, diagnosis, or monitoring response to treatment or relapse of neuroendocrine tumors, especially carcinoid tumors.
Many of these tumors release large quantities of the hormone associated with that tissue, either continuously or intermittently, causing symptoms characteristic for that tumor. However, not all neuroendocrine tumors release expected hormones. In either case, neuroendocrine tumors are frequently associated with increased concentrations of CgA.
Carcinoid tumors, a subset of neuroendocrine tumors, are slow-growing noncancerous or cancerous masses. These form mainly in the digestive tract (stomach, pancreas, small intestine, colon, appendix, rectum) or the lungs. According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors and 2,000 to 4,500 lung carcinoid tumors newly diagnosed each year in the United States.
When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs.

When you have symptoms suggestive of a carcinoid tumor, such as flushing, abdominal pain or discomfort followed by diarrhea, and/or wheezing; when your healthcare provider thinks that you may have a carcinoid or other neuroendocrine tumor


","



A CgA test is ordered along with other tests when a healthcare practitioner suspects that your signs and symptoms are due to a carcinoid tumor or other neuroendocrine tumor.
Some signs and symptoms may include:

Flushing of the face and neck (appearance of deep red color, usually with sudden onset)
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and signs of intestinal blockage
Rapid heart rate
Chest pain, wheezing, coughing, difficulty breathing

This test may be ordered periodically to help evaluate treatment effectiveness and monitor for tumor recurrence.



","



The level of chromogranin A in the blood is normally low. If you have no signs or symptoms and a normal level of CgA, it is unlikely you have a neuroendocrine tumor. However, no test is one hundred percent accurate, and it is possible to have a neuroendocrine tumor, even if the level of CgA is normal.
An increased CgA level when you have symptoms may indicate the presence of a tumor, but it is not specific for the type of tumor or its location. In order to diagnose the condition, the tumor itself must be located, biopsied, and examined by a pathologist. Your healthcare practitioner will frequently follow an abnormal test result with an order for an imaging scan to help locate any tumor(s) that may be present.
Not all patients with a neuroendocrine tumor have typical signs and symptoms. Some tumors do not produce the hormone associated with that tissue or only produce it intermittently.
The level of CgA is proportional to the tumor burden (the mass of the tumor). If levels of CgA are elevated prior to treatment and then fall after treatment is started, then treatment is likely to have been effective. If following the treatment, the monitored levels begin to rise; then you may have a recurrence of the tumor.



","



There is currently no FDA-approved chromogranin A test, and FDA approval for this test is not required. Those CgA tests that have been developed and validated by individual laboratories are all slightly different, and their results are not interchangeable. When monitoring CgA levels over time, the tests should be performed by the same laboratory and the same method so that values can be compared.



","



The chromogranin A (CgA) test is used as a tumor marker. It may be ordered alone or in combination with a 5-HIAA test to help diagnose carcinoid tumors. CgA may also be used to detect the presence of other tumors arising from neuroendocrine cells.
A CgA test may also be used to help monitor the effectiveness of treatment and detect recurrence of these tumors.

Chromosome analysis or karyotyping is a test that evaluates the number and structure of a person's chromosomes in order to detect abnormalities. Chromosomes are thread-like structures within each cell nucleus and contain the body's genetic blueprint. Each chromosome contains thousands of genes in specific locations. These genes are responsible for a person’s inherited physical characteristics and they have a profound impact on growth, development, and function.
Humans have 46 chromosomes, present as 23 pairs. Twenty-two pairs are found in both sexes (autosomes) and one pair (sex chromosomes) is present as either XY (in males) or XX (in females). Normally, all cells in the body that have a nucleus will contain a complete set of the same 46 chromosomes, except for the reproductive cells (eggs and sperm), which contain a half set of 23. This half set is the genetic contribution that will be passed on to a child. At conception, half sets from each parent combine to form a new set of 46 chromosomes in the developing fetus.
Chromosomal abnormalities include both numerical and structural changes. For numerical changes, anything other than a complete set of 46 chromosomes represents a change in the amount of genetic material present and can cause health and development problems. For structural changes, the significance of the problems and their severity depends upon the chromosome that is altered. The type and degree of the problem may vary from person to person, even when the same chromosome abnormality is present.
A chromosomal karyotyping examines a person's chromosomes to determine if the right number is present and to determine if each chromosome appears normal. It requires experience and expertise to perform properly and to interpret the results. While theoretically almost any cells could be used to perform testing, in practice it is usually performed on amniotic fluid to evaluate a fetus and on lymphocytes (a white blood cell) from a blood sample to test all other ages. Alternately, white blood cells may be obtained from bone marrow aspirations to look for changes in individuals suspected of having hematologic or lymphoid diseases (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, refractory anemia).
The test is performed by:

Taking a sample of a person's cells, culturing them in nutrient-enriched media to promote cell division in vitro. This is done in order to select a specific time during the cells' growth phase when the chromosomes are easiest to distinguish.
Isolating the chromosomes from the nucleus of the cells, placing them on a slide, and treating them with a special stain.
Taking microphotographs of the chromosomes.
In jigsaw puzzle fashion, rearranging the pictures of the chromosomes to match up pairs and arrange them by size, from largest to smallest, numbers 1 to 22, followed by the sex chromosomes as the 23rd pair.
The pictures also allow the chromosomes to be vertically oriented. Each chromosome looks like a striped straw. It has two arms that differ in length (a short arm (p) and a long arm (q)), a pinched-in area between the arms called a centromere, and a series of light and dark horizontal bands. The length of the arms and the location of the bands help determine top from bottom.
Once the chromosome photo arrangement is completed, a laboratory specialist evaluates the chromosome pairs and identifies any abnormalities that may be present.

Some chromosomal disorders that may be detected include:

Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), caused by an extra chromosome 21; this may occur in all or most cells of the body.
Edwards syndrome (Trisomy 18), a condition associated with severe mental retardation; caused by an extra chromosome 18.
Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13), caused by an extra chromosome 13.
Klinefelter syndrome, the most common sex chromosome abnormality in males; caused by an extra X chromosome.
Turner syndrome, caused by missing one X chromosome in females.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia, a classic 9;22 translocation that is diagnostic of the disease.

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Amniotic fluid and chorionic villi are collected from a pregnant woman by a healthcare practitioner using amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling procedures.

","



A chromosome analysis may be ordered when a fetus is suspected of having a chromosomal abnormality, when an infant has congenital abnormalities, when a woman experiences miscarriages or infertility, and when an adult shows signs of a genetic disorder.
It may also be ordered to detect the presence of a chromosomal abnormality in family members when it has been detected in a child or in another family member.
It may be ordered to detect acquired chromosomal abnormalities when an individual has leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, refractory anemia, or another cancer.



","



Interpretation of test results must be done by a person with specialized training in cytogenetics. Some findings are relatively straightforward, such as an extra chromosome 21 (Trisomy 21) indicating Down syndrome, but others may be very complex.
Although there will be typical signs with specific chromosomal abnormalities, the effects and the severity may vary from person to person and often cannot be reliably predicted.
Some examples of abnormalities that chromosome analysis may reveal include:



Trisomy
This is the presence of an extra chromosome, a third instead of a pair. Diseases associated with trisomies include Down syndrome (associated with a Trisomy of chromosome 21), Patau syndrome (Trisomy 13), Edward syndrome (Trisomy 18), and Klinefelter syndrome (a male with an extra X chromosome – XXY instead of XY).


Monosomy
This is the absence of one of the chromosomes. An example of monosomy is Turner syndrome (a female with a single X chromosome – X instead of XX). Most other monosomies are not compatible with life.


Deletions
These are missing pieces of chromosomes and/or genetic material. Some may be small and difficult to be detected.


Duplications
These represent extra genetic material and may be present on any chromosome, such as the presence of two horizontal bands at a specific location instead of one.


Translocations
With translocations, pieces of chromosomes break off and reattach to another chromosome. If it is a one-to-one switch and all of the genetic material is present (but in the wrong place), it is said to be a balanced translocation. If it is not, then it is called an unbalanced translocation.


Genetic Rearrangement
With this, genetic material is present on a chromosome but not in its usual location. A person could have both rearrangement and duplication or deletion. An almost infinite number of rearrangements are possible. Interpreting the affects of the changes can be challenging.



Duplications, deletions, translocations, and genetic rearrangements can cause a myriad of health and development issues. It depends upon what genes are missing or are present in too many copies.
Some genetic rearrangements will be variations that do not cause noticeable symptoms. Balanced translocations (where two chromosomes have swapped portions of themselves but all of the genetic material is present) may cause no problems for the person who has them but may cause problems in their children.
Many hematologic and lymphoid malignancies (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, myelodysplasia) are associated with chromosomal abnormalities, which can help diagnose the disease and/or predict the clinical course of the disease.



","



Since the sex chromosomes (XX or XY) are identified during the chromosome analysis, this test will also, as a byproduct, definitely determine the sex of a fetus.
Some chromosome alterations are too small or subtle to detect with karyotyping. Other testing technique such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or a microarray may sometimes be performed to further investigate chromosomal abnormalities.
It is possible for people to have cells in their body with differing genetic material. This happens because of changes early in the development of a fetus that lead to the development of distinctly different cell lines and is called mosaicism. An example of this is some cases of Down syndrome. The affected person can have some cells with an extra third chromosome 21 and some cells with the normal pair.

A chromosomal karyotype is used to detect chromosome abnormalities and thus used to diagnose genetic diseases, some birth defects, and certain disorders of the blood or lymphatic system.
It may be performed for:

A fetus, using amniotic fluid or chorionic villi (tissue from the placenta):

	
If one or more of a woman's pregnancy screening tests, such as the first trimester Down syndrome screen or the second trimester maternal serum screening, are abnormal.
If a pregnant woman is having amniotic fluid analysis performed because she is considered at higher than normal risk of having a baby with a birth defect.
If fetal structural and/or developmental abnormalities are detected, such as during an ultrasound.

Chymotrypsin is an enzyme that digests protein in the small intestine. This test measures the amount of chymotrypsin in stool to help evaluate whether your pancreas is functioning properly.
Chymotrypsinogen, the inactive precursor of chymotrypsin, is produced in the pancreas and transported to the small intestine. In the small intestine, it is activated to form chymotrypsin. It is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down the protein in food into smaller pieces, called peptides. Chymotrypsin is detectable in the stool if the pancreas is functioning normally.
Individuals with pancreatic dysfunction may either have blocked pancreatic ducts or the cells that produce chymotrypsinogen may be damaged or destroyed. Such cell damage and duct blockage cause pancreatic insufficiency because the amount of enzymes transported to the small intestine is inadequate for proper food digestion. This is often seen in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and sometimes pancreatic cancer.

","



Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) is a form of an enzyme found primarily in heart muscle cells. This test measures CK-MB in the blood.
CK-MB is one of three forms (isoenzymes) of the enzyme creatine kinase (CK). These isoenzymes include:

CK-MM (found in skeletal muscles and the heart)
CK-MB (found mostly in the heart, but small amounts found in skeletal muscles)
CK-BB (found mostly in the brain and smooth muscle, such as the intestines and uterus)

CK is released from muscle cells and is detectable in the blood whenever there is muscle damage. The small amount of CK that is normally in the blood is primarily CK-MM. CK-BB almost never gets into the blood, and CK-MB will typically only be present in significant amounts when the heart is damaged. A CK test measures the total level but does not distinguish between the three isoenzymes. When there is an increased amount of CK present in the blood, the CK-MB test can be used to determine whether it is due to heart damage or is more likely to be related to skeletal muscle injury.

CK-MB is usually ordered along with or following an elevated total CK when a person has chest pain and a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether the pain is due to a heart attack. It is typically ordered for this purpose when the more specific troponin test is not available. A CK-MB may also be ordered when a person has a high CK to determine whether the muscle damage detected is to the heart or other muscles.
Increased CK-MB can usually be detected in someone with a heart attack about 3-6 hours after the onset of chest pain. The level of CK-MB peaks in 12-24 hours and then returns to normal within about 48-72 hours. If there is a second heart attack or ongoing damage, then levels may rise again and/or stay elevated longer.



","



CK-MB is normally undetectable or very low in the blood.
Chest pain and increased CK levels plus elevated CK-MB indicate that it is likely that a person has recently had a heart attack. Levels that drop, then rise again may indicate a second heart attack and/or ongoing heart damage.
If CK-MB is elevated and the ratio of CK-MB to total CK (relative index) is more than 2.5-3, then it is likely that the heart was damaged. A high CK with a relative index below this value suggests that skeletal muscles were damaged. (For more, see Common Questions #3.)
Any kind of heart muscle damage can cause an increase in CK and CK-MB, including physical damage from trauma, surgery, inflammation, and decreased oxygen (ischemia). Strenuous exercise may also increase both CK and CK-MB, but usually with a lower relative index.
Kidney failure can cause a high CK-MB level.
Rarely, chronic muscle disease, low thyroid hormone (T3, T4) levels, and alcohol abuse can increase CK-MB.



","



Since CK-MB is also present in small quantities in skeletal muscle, significant damage to skeletal muscles can also increase the CK-MB level. If both skeletal and heart muscles are damaged, the presence of CK-MB due to a heart attack could be masked.



",,"



A creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) test may be used as a follow-up test to an elevated creatine kinase (CK) in order to determine whether the increase is due to heart damage or skeletal muscle damage. The test is most likely to be ordered if a person has chest pain or if a person's diagnosis is unclear, such as if a person has nonspecific symptoms like shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, dizziness, or nausea.
CK and CK-MB were once the primary tests ordered to detect and monitor heart attacks, but they have now been largely replaced by the troponin test, which is more specific for damage to the heart.
Sometimes, the CK test may be used if a heart attack is suspected and a troponin test is not available. In this case, when CK is elevated, a CK-MB test may be used as a follow-up test to determine whether the increase is due to heart damage or skeletal muscle damage.

","

To help evaluate your likely response to the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel by detecting variations in the gene (CYP2C19) that codes for one of the enzymes that metabolizes the drug; clopidogrel is prescribed for people who are at risk of a heart attack or stroke to help prevent harmful blood clots from forming.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein, a swab rubbed on the inside of your cheek, or you spit saliva in a clean container.


","



This test helps determine if you may be less responsive to the drug clopidogrel because of your genetic makeup. This test detects genetic variation in the gene CYP2C19. A healthcare practitioner may sometimes order this test to determine whether clopidogrel will be effective for you or if another drug for treatment may be required.
Clopidogrel is a drug that is part of a group of medications called antiplatelet drugs and is used to prevent strokes and heart attacks in people who are at increased risk for these serious cardiovascular events. The drug works by helping to prevent harmful blood clots from forming by preventing platelets from clumping together (aggregating).
Normally, when an injury occurs to blood vessels, platelets in the blood stick to the site of injury and clump together to start the formation of a blood clot and help stop the bleeding. In people at increased risk for heart attack or stroke, this process can occur inappropriately, so they may be treated with drugs that prevent platelet aggregation.
Clopidogrel is given in an inactive form (i.e., prodrug) and must be changed (metabolized) by the body to an active form before it can be effective. Some people who have some genetic variations in the gene CYP2C19 do not metabolize clopidogrel to its active form as well as people who do not have these genetic variations in CYP2C19. Therefore, individuals with CYP2C19 genetic variations who are taking clopidogrel may not receive adequate benefit from the drug and may be at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. This test identifies people who have one or more CYP2C19 variants.
You inherit one copy of each of your genes from your mother and one copy from your father. Thus, the CYP2C19 gene is present in the body as two inherited gene copies (alleles). You could have both copies of a gene without any variants (wild-type, normal); one copy without variants and one copy with a variant (heterozygous); both copies with the same variant (homozygous); or both copies with different variants (compound heterozygous). The combination of the CYP2C19 gene copies that you have can determine how effectively clopidogrel is changed to its active form in your body and its overall effect.
Clopidogrel responsiveness (or clopidogrel genotype) testing determines whether CYP2C19 gene variants are present. Careful interpretation of the results can help the healthcare provider decide the appropriate antiplatelet treatment for you.

","



Results of genetic testing require careful interpretation. Typically, your lab report will include an explanation from a healthcare practitioner with expertise in this area. A number of factors are taken into account when determining whether clopidogrel is an appropriate treatment for you.
In general, if you have one or two variant copies of the gene, then you may have an altered response to clopidogrel. The degree of responsiveness depends upon the variation(s) present and upon your body. You may be a normal, poor, intermediate, extensive, or ultra-rapid metabolizer of the drug.
Not every laboratory will test for every gene variant. Laboratories most commonly look for the CYP2C19 variant alleles *2 and *3. A less common gene variant may be present that is not detected by the test. You may also have decreased drug metabolism due to another factor. CYP2C19 gene variation is only one factor in your response to clopidogrel.



","



To increase awareness of the influence of the CYP2C19 gene variations and the availability of testing, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promoted changes to the Plavix® (clopidogrel) label to inform consumers that genetic factors may affect how well the drug works for them.
The enzyme CYP2C19, coded for by the CYP2C19 gene, metabolizes a wide variety of drugs in addition to clopidogrel. Thus, if you are taking clopidogrel plus one or more additional medications metabolized by CYP2C19, then you may have altered metabolism of clopidogrel and the other drugs. One of the prominent examples of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2C19 is omeprazole that is taken to control stomach acid production. Others include diazepam, anti-seizure medications, and antidepressants.
Testing to predict how someone will respond to a drug is a form of personalized medicine known as pharmacogenomics. Research is ongoing in this field of study in an effort to treat individuals' conditions effectively, yet avoid side effects.



","



This test is used to determine your potential responsiveness to clopidogrel, an antiplatelet medication, before you start taking the drug or during the initial treatment phase.
Clopidogrel genotype testing is used to detect variation in the CYP2C19 gene that codes for one of the enzymes responsible for metabolizing clopidogrel into its active form. Variations in CYP2C19 are most often associated with reduced enzyme activity and decreased metabolism of clopidogrel, leading to a low level of active drug and potentially ineffective treatment for risk of blood clots. Testing for variants of the CYP2C19 gene is done to help tailor treatment for an individual (known as pharmacogenetic testing). If you have certain genetic variations, you may require an alternative therapy to treat your condition more effectively.
Clopidogrel-related genetic testing is not widely used at this time. Although studies have shown that CYP2C19 variation contributes to a person's responsiveness to clopidogrel, there is no agreement yet among experts on the need for the testing. Part of the reason is that genetic variants of CYP2C19 explain only some of the treatment response variability among people.

To detect the presence of an infection caused by toxin-producing Clostridium difficile bacteria


","

A fresh liquid or unformed stool sample is collected in a sterile container. The stool sample should not be contaminated with urine or water. Once it has been collected, the stool should be taken to the laboratory immediately or refrigerated and taken to the lab as soon as possible.


","



Clostridium difficile (commonly called C. difficile or C. diff) is a type of bacteria that is associated with diarrhea resulting from antibiotic use. C. difficile testing and C. difficile toxin tests identify the presence of these bacteria, genes associated with toxin production, and/or detect the toxins produced by them.
Clostridium difficile has been recently reclassified and renamed as Clostridioides difficile, but since many people still use the former name, it will be used for the purposes of this article.
C. difficile may be present as part of the normal bacterial flora in the digestive tract of up to 65% of healthy infants and 3% of healthy adults. Sometimes, when broad-spectrum antibiotics are used to treat other infections, typically for an extended period, the balance of the normal flora in the digestive tract is disrupted. Normal bacterial flora that are susceptible to the antibiotic are eliminated from the digestive tract, while C. difficile that are resistant to the antibiotic remain and begin to overgrow, or new types (strains) of C. difficile are acquired.
C. difficile usually produced two toxins: toxin A and toxin B. The resulting combination of decreased normal flora, overgrowth of C. difficile, and toxin production can damage the lining of the lower portion of the digestive tract (colon, bowel) and lead to severe inflammation of the colon and prolonged diarrhea. Dead tissue, fibrin, and numerous white blood cells can form a lining over the surface of the inflamed bowel (a pseudomembrane), a condition that is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis.
C. difficile infection is the most common cause of diarrhea in people who develop diarrheal symptoms while hospitalized. C. difficile toxin is detected in the stools of up to 20-30% of those with antibiotic-associated diarrhea and greater than 95% of those with pseudomembranous colitis. While the organism is frequently carried by infants, it does not usually cause diarrhea in this population.
The risk of having symptoms increases with age and increases in those who have weakened immune systems, have acute or chronic colon conditions, have been previously affected by C. difficile, or who have had recent gastrointestinal surgery or chemotherapy. C. difficile-associated diarrhea usually occurs in people who have been taking antibiotics for several days, but it can also occur several weeks after treatment is completed.
C. difficile-associated disease is a spectrum of illness ranging from mild diarrhea to a more severe colitis, or to toxic megacolon or perforated bowel, which can result in sepsis and death. Signs and symptoms may include frequent loose stools, abdominal pain and cramps, nausea, fever, dehydration, fatigue, and high white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Treatment typically involves discontinuing use of the original antibiotic and administering specific oral antibiotic therapy targeting C. difficile. Most people improve as the normal bacterial flora re-colonize the gastrointestinal tract, but about 12-24% of those affected may have a second episode within two months.
For a description of tests used to identify C. difficile and toxins, see the ""How is it used?"" section.

When a person has mild, moderate, or severe diarrhea that persists for several days, without another explanation, especially in people who have recently been on antibiotic therapy


","



C. difficile testing may be ordered when a person hospitalized for more than three days has frequent watery stools, abdominal pain, fever, and/or nausea during or following a course of antibiotics or following a recent gastrointestinal surgery. Testing may be ordered for outpatients when someone develops these symptoms within 6-8 weeks after taking antibiotics, several days after chemotherapy, or when a person has a chronic digestive tract disorder that a healthcare practitioner suspects is being worsened by a C. difficile infection. Tests for C. difficile may be ordered to help diagnose the cause of diarrhea when no other infectious or non-infectious causes have been detected.
When a person treated for antibiotic-associated diarrhea or colitis relapses and symptoms reoccur, C. difficile testing may be ordered to confirm the presence of the toxin. Testing should not be ordered to monitor the effectiveness of treatment or for those who are asymptomatic. A subsiding of symptoms (diarrhea ceases and stools are formed) indicates a cure from infection. Repeat testing for C. difficile after a positive result is not advised and provides no useful clinical information. Molecular tests may remain positive for weeks after someone is cured and asymptomatic.



","



If tests for C. difficile toxin gene and C. difficile toxin are positive, it is likely that the person's diarrhea and related symptoms are due to the presence of toxin-producing C. difficile.
A positive result for C. difficile bacteria or C. difficile antigen (GDH) but a negative C. difficile toxin result means that the bacteria are present in the digestive tract but are not producing a detectable level of toxin.
A negative test result for the C. difficile toxin gene likely indicates that the person's diarrhea and related symptoms are not due to toxin-producing C. difficile.
Negative test results for both the bacteria and the toxin may mean that the diarrhea and other symptoms are being caused by something other than C. difficile. Since the toxin breaks down at room temperature within two hours, a negative result may also indicate that the sample was not transported, stored, or processed promptly. If there is a concern that a stool specimen has not been collected and processed properly, a second specimen may be submitted for testing after discussion with the laboratory.



","



If a person has positive C. difficile test results, the healthcare practitioner will typically discontinue any antibiotics that the person is taking and prescribe an appropriate treatment of oral antibiotic, such as vancomycin or fidaxomicin, to eliminate the C. difficile bacteria. Recently, so-called stool transplants have been investigated as an effective treatment for people with recurrent C. difficile infections.
An endoscopic procedure can be used to diagnose C. difficile colitis. A specialist (gastroenterologist) can examine the colon and biopsy any characteristic pseudomembranous lesions that may be present.



","



Tests to detect Clostridium difficile (C. difficile or C. diff for short), the genes associated with toxin production, and its toxins are used to help diagnose diarrhea and other conditions and complications caused by toxin-producing C. difficile. (See the ""What is being tested?"" section for more information.) There are many infectious and non-infectious causes of acute and chronic diarrhea and this testing may be used to help determine the cause.
A number of tests are available to detect C. difficile and to determine if the strain that is present produces toxin.
The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2017 guideline and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2013 guideline have both proposed using either a one-step or a multi-step testing process. The one-step process includes:

C. difficile toxin gene testing—this tests for the toxin genes using nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), typically a PCR method. These tests are rapid and very sensitive methods to confirm the presence of C. difficile toxin gene. Not all laboratories have the capability of performing these molecular tests, but they have recently become much more widely available. False positives with this method can be minimized by only testing those people who are symptomatic and likely to have C. difficile infection.
	 

The multi-step process includes:

Perform an initial screen on stool samples using a test for a C. difficile antigen called glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). This test detects an antigen that is produced in high amounts by C. difficile, both toxin and non-toxin producing strains. It is considered to be very sensitive, but it is not very specific for toxin-producing C. difficile. This test indicates if C. difficile is present but not if the bacteria are producing toxins.
Follow-up positive screening results with a test to confirm and to detect the presence of toxins:
	
Toxins, by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) tests; these tests are rapid but less sensitive.
In some laboratories, a positive GDH test with a negative toxin EIA test leads to a NAAT.


As an alternative multi-step process, SHEA/IDSA list performing a NAAT toxin gene test followed by a toxin test (rather than a NAAT test by itself).
	 

Other tests that may sometimes be performed to detect C. difficile include:

Gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen panels—these are used to simultaneously test for the presence of multiple disease-causing (pathogenic) viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites in a stool sample and help diagnose an infection of the digestive system (GI tract). Since there are many causes of GI infections, including C. difficile, a GI pathogen panel may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a stool culture or an ova and parasite exam (O&P), to help establish a diagnosis.
Cell cytotoxicity test is a tissue culture to detect the C. difficile toxin. It is a test that looks for the effects of the cytotoxin (cytotoxicity) on human cells grown in culture. It is a sensitive method to detect toxin, but it requires 24 to 48 hours to get the test result. It is rarely performed in clinical microbiology laboratories.
Toxigenic stool culture, which requires growing the bacteria in a culture and a second step to detect the presence of the toxins, is a very sensitive test for C. difficile. It is still considered to be the gold standard. However, it can take 2 to 3 days for results. It is rarely performed in clinical microbiology laboratories.

Coagulation factors are proteins circulating in the blood that are essential for proper blood clot formation. Coagulation factor tests measure the function of or sometimes the amount of these proteins in the blood.
Blood clotting is a complex process that involves numerous coagulation factors, which are produced by the liver and blood vessels. Each coagulation factor is evaluated with one or more tests. When factor levels are low, it can cause blood clotting to fail, leading to unexplained bleeding episodes. Measuring coagulation factors can help a healthcare practitioner determine the cause of the bleeding and the best treatment.
Coagulation factors are usually tested by measuring the factor's activity level in the blood. Activity assays can detect reduced levels of protein or proteins that don't function properly. Rarely, the amount (antigen level) of a coagulation factor may also be measured. Coagulation factor antigen tests can tell how much of the protein is present, but not whether its function is normal.
When someone bleeds (e.g., with an injury), the coagulation system is activated, plugging the leaking blood vessel with a clot. The coagulation system consists of a series of coagulation factors that activate in a step-by-step process called the coagulation cascade. The end result is the formation of insoluble fibrin threads that link together at the site of injury, along with aggregated cell fragments called platelets, to form a stable blood clot. The clot prevents additional blood loss and remains in place until the injured area has healed.
Blood clotting is dynamic; once a clot is formed, other factors are activated that slow clotting or dissolve the clot in a process called fibrinolysis. The clot is eventually removed after the injury site heals. In normal healthy individuals, this balance between clot formation and removal ensures that bleeding does not become excessive and that clots are removed once they are no longer needed.
For people with bleeding disorders, clotting does not work properly because they lack platelets or coagulation factors, or their platelets or factors don't work properly. There are a variety of bleeding disorders that may be passed through families (inherited) or acquired after birth. If a person has signs and symptoms of one of these disorders, coagulation factor testing may be ordered to help determine the diagnosis and treatment.
There are nine coagulation factor proteins that can be measured clinically (see table below). These factors are referred to by a name or Roman numeral or both in some cases. For example, coagulation factor II is also known as prothrombin. When one or more of these factors are produced in too small a quantity, or are not functioning correctly, they can cause excessive bleeding.

When you have unexplained or prolonged bleeding, abnormal results on coagulation screening tests such as prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT), or have a relative with a hereditary coagulation factor deficiency; you may be tested when your healthcare practitioner wants to monitor the severity of a factor deficiency and/or the effectiveness of treatment.


","



Coagulation factor tests are typically ordered when someone has a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and/or partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The PT and PTT tests are used as screening tools to determine if someone has a coagulation problem or as part of an investigative workup when someone has signs and symptoms of a bleeding disorder, such as unexplained bruising, bleeding gums, excess bleeding from small cuts, or frequent nose bleeds.
Factor activity may be measured when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a patient has an acquired condition that is causing bleeding, such as vitamin K deficiency or liver disease.
Factor testing may be done when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a patient has an inherited coagulation factor deficiency such as Von Willebrand disease or hemophilia A, especially when bleeding episodes begin early in life or when a close relative has an inherited factor deficiency. When an inherited deficiency is suspected, other family members may also be tested to help confirm the person's diagnosis and to establish whether they may be carriers of the condition or have the deficiency themselves (in an asymptomatic or less severe form).
Sometimes factor testing may be done for a person with a known deficiency to monitor the factor deficiency and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.
Occasionally, factor testing is ordered when someone has an unexplained blood clot (thrombosis) to determine whether abnormally high factor activity is the underlying cause (e.g., elevated factor VIII activity is associated with excess clotting).



","



Normal coagulation factor activity usually means normal clotting function. Low activity of one or more coagulation factors usually means impaired clotting ability. Each coagulation factor must be present in sufficient quantity in order for normal clotting to occur, but the level required is different for each factor. Results are frequently reported as a percentage with 100% being normal. For example, a factor VIII that is 30% would be considered abnormally low.
Deficiencies in coagulation factors can develop in several different ways. They may be acquired as part of other diseases or inherited. Deficiencies vary in severity and may be permanent or temporary.
If more than one clotting factor is decreased, it is usually due to an acquired condition. Acquired deficiencies are rare and may be caused by chronic or acute conditions, including:

Excess blood clotting that uses up coagulation factor (e.g., disseminated intravascular coagulation)
Liver disease (i.e., cirrhosis)
Some cancers
Exposure to snake venom
Fat malabsorption
Vitamin K deficiency
Anticoagulation therapy (warfarin)
Massive blood transfusions (e.g., transfuse only red blood cell units)

Inherited coagulation factor deficiencies are rare. They tend to involve only one factor, which may be reduced or absent (below the detectable limit).
Hemophilia A and B are the most common examples of inherited disorders. They are X-linked deficiencies of factors VIII and IX that occur almost exclusively in men. Women are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of these genetic traits or have mild bleeding. Other inherited factor deficiencies, not associated with the X chromosome, are found equally in both men and women.
The severity of symptoms associated with an inherited factor deficiency depends on the factor involved, its functionality, and the amount of factor available. Symptoms may vary from episode to episode, ranging from excessive bleeding after dental procedures to severe recurrent bleeding into joints or muscles.
Individuals with a modest reduction in coagulation factor activity may have few symptoms and may discover their deficiency in adulthood, after a surgical procedure or trauma or during screening that includes a prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test.
Individuals with severe factor deficiencies may have their first bleeding episode very early; for example, a male infant with a deficiency of Factor VIII, IX, or XIII may bleed excessively after circumcision.
Elevated levels of several factors are seen in situations of acute illness, stress, or inflammation. Some people have persistent elevations of factor VIII that may be associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis.



","



For both inherited and acquired factor deficiencies, the missing factor(s), once identified, can be replaced as needed. This may be done with a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which contains various coagulation factors, with a concentrated cryoprecipitate, or with replacement factors (some are available commercially, such as recombinant factor VIII). These treatments may be used during a bleeding episode or as a preventive measure to prevent excessive bleeding during an upcoming surgery or other invasive procedure.



","



Coagulation factor testing is performed to determine if a person has enough coagulation activity to control the blood clotting process. It is used by healthcare practitioners to determine if the level of a coagulation factor is low or absent (below the detectable limit) or if it is too high. Low coagulation factor activity is associated with reduced clot formation and excess bleeding. High coagulation factor activity can be associated with too much clot formation (thrombosis) and blockade in the circulatory system (thromboembolism).
One or more coagulation factor activity tests may be ordered to evaluate the function of specific factors. If a test result shows reduced activity, then an antigen test may be ordered as a follow-up test. This is occasionally done to determine if the low activity is due to a decreased quantity of a normal coagulation factor or due to a coagulation factor that does not function normally.
Coagulation factor testing may sometimes be ordered if a person has a family history of bleeding.

","

Cold agglutinins are autoantibodies produced by a person's immune system that mistakenly target red blood cells (RBCs). They cause RBCs to clump together when a person is exposed to cold temperatures and increase the likelihood that the affected RBCs will be destroyed by the body. This test detects and measures the amount of cold agglutinins in the blood.
When the presence of cold agglutinins in a person's blood leads to significant RBC destruction, it can cause hemolytic anemia and lead to a low RBC count and hemoglobin. This rare form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia is known as cold agglutinin disease. Cold agglutinin disease may be primary or secondary, induced by some other disease or condition.
Primary cold agglutinin disease typically affects those who are middle age to elderly, and it tends to continue over time (chronic). Secondary cold agglutinin disease may affect anyone and may be acute or chronic, temporary or persistent. It may cause hemolytic anemia to a greater or lesser degree and is associated with a variety of conditions. For details see the ""What does the test result mean?"" section in Common Questions below.
The cold agglutinin test is not routinely ordered. It is a test that has been available for a long time, but it has become less commonly used as more specific tests for secondary causes, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, have become available.

Fatigue, weakness, lack of energy, pale skin (pallor), dizziness and/or headaches from anemia
In some cases, painful bluish fingers, toes, ears, and the tip of the nose that occur with exposure to cold temperatures




","



The result of a cold agglutinin test is typically reported as a titer, such as 1:64 or 1:512. A higher number means that there are more autoantibodies present.
A positive titer may mean that the person tested has cold agglutinin disease. Cold agglutinin disease may be primary or secondary, induced by some other disease or condition such as:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections—up to 75% of those affected will have increased cold agglutinins.
Mono (infectious mononucleosis)—more than 60% of those affected will have increased cold agglutinins, but anemia is rare with this infection.
Some cancers, including lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma
Some other bacterial infections, such as Legionnaires disease and syphilis
Some parasitic infections, such as malaria
Some viral infections such as HIV, influenza, CMV, EBV, hepatitis C

Higher titers of autoantibodies and those that react at warmer temperatures are associated with hemolytic anemia and worse symptoms.
The degree of red blood cell (RBC) hemolysis and hemolytic anemia will vary from person to person and with each episode of cold exposure. Some conditions, such as infectious mononucleosis, are frequently associated with elevated cold agglutinins but rarely associated with anemia.



","



A cold agglutinin test may rarely be ordered to identify increased cold agglutinins if someone has a condition that has been linked to secondary cold agglutinin disease, such as infectious mononucleosis or a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Since the test is not specific for these conditions, it is not typically ordered to diagnose or monitor them.



",,"



A cold agglutinin test may be used to help detect cold agglutinin disease and determine the cause of a person's hemolytic anemia. It may be used as a follow-up test after a complete blood count (CBC) shows a decrease in a person's red blood cell (RBC) count and hemoglobin, especially if these findings are linked to an exposure to cold temperatures.
Cold agglutinin disease is a rare autoimmune disorder in which autoantibodies produced by a person's immune system mistakenly target and destroy RBCs, causing hemolytic anemia. These autoantibodies are cold-reacting and can cause signs and symptoms related to anemia after an affected person is exposed to cold temperatures. This disease may be classified as either primary or secondary, triggered by an infection or other condition.

","

To determine whether deficiencies or abnormalities in complement system proteins are contributing to increased infections or increased autoimmune activity; to help monitor the activity and treatment of autoimmune diseases and immune complex-related diseases (Complement deficiencies may comprise between 1 and 10% of all primary immunodeficiencies.)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



The complement system consists of almost 60 proteins, approximately 30 of which are circulating blood proteins that work together to promote immune and inflammatory responses. Complement tests measure the amount or activity of complement proteins in the blood.
The complement system's principal role is to help identify, destroy and remove foreign pathogens like bacteria and viruses, as well as damaged ""self"" materials (e.g., cells and proteins). The complement system is so named because it “complements” or aids the natural body defenses, such as antibodies. So, the complement system is also activated when the body makes antibodies, whether against itself or foreign invaders. The body makes antibodies against its own tissues that it thinks are foreign (autoantibodies) in various autoimmune diseases.
The complement system is part of the body's innate immune system. Unlike the acquired immune system, which produces antibodies that target and protect against specific threats, the innate immune system is non-specific and can quickly respond to foreign substances. It does not require previous exposure to an invading microbe or offending substance and does not maintain a memory of previous encounters.
There are nine primary complement proteins that are designated C1 through C9. These components, in addition to the remaining proteins, work together in a cascade-like approach by activating, amplifying, breaking apart, and forming protein complexes that respond to infections, ""non-self"" tissues (e.g., transplants), dead cell debris (e.g., from apoptosis), or inflammation.
The complement cascade consists of 3 separate pathways that may be activated to converge in a final common pathway. The pathways include the ""classical pathway"" (including components C1qrs, C2, C4), the ""alternative pathway"" (including components C3, factor B, properdin), and the ""lectin pathway"" (a.k.a. mannan-binding lectin [MBL]). The end result of all three activation pathways is the same – the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). Complement activation causes several things to happen (""complement cascade""):

The MAC binds to the surface of each microbe, abnormal cell, or substance that has been targeted for destruction. It creates a lesion (hole) in the membrane wall and causes lysis, which is destruction of the cell by letting the contents out – like piercing a water-filled balloon.
It increases the permeability of blood vessels, allowing infection-fighting white blood cells (WBCs) to move out of the bloodstream and into tissues.
It attracts WBCs to the site of the infection.
It stimulates phagocytosis, a process in which microbes are engulfed by macrophages and neutrophils and killed.
It also labels immune complexes with complement components so that WBCs will engulf them and clear them out of the blood.

Complement tests measure the amount or the function (activity) of complement proteins in the blood. Complement components may be measured individually or together to determine whether the system is functioning normally. C3 and C4 are the most frequently measured complement proteins. Total complement activity can be measured if a healthcare practitioner suspects a deficiency that is not measured by C3 or C4. The CH50 functional test measures the function of the complete classical complement pathway, mediated by components C1 – C9. If this measurement is outside the normal range, then each of the nine different complement levels can be measured individually to look for hereditary or acquired deficiencies.

When you have recurrent microbial (usually bacterial) infections, unexplained inflammation or edema, or symptoms related to an autoimmune disorder; periodically to help monitor a known acute or chronic condition that affects the complement system


","



Complement testing may be ordered when a person has unexplained inflammation or edema or symptoms of an autoimmune disorder such as lupus. It may also be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone may have an immune complex-related condition and wants to check the status of the person's complement system.
Individual complement components may be ordered when the total complement activity (CH50, sometimes called CH100) is abnormal to help determine which of the components are deficient or abnormal. C3 and C4 levels are the most frequently ordered, but others, such as C1 inhibitor, may be ordered when other deficiencies are suspected. C3 and C4 are often ordered together as the relative levels are often important.
When an acute or chronic condition has been diagnosed, complement testing may be used to help give a rough idea of the severity of the condition with the assumption that the severity is linked to the decrease in complement levels. Complement testing may also be ordered occasionally when a healthcare practitioner wants to monitor the current activity of a condition.



","



Complement levels may be decreased due to increased consumption (because of increased activation) or, more rarely, a hereditary deficiency. Hereditary deficiency in one of the complement proteins will usually lead to a high frequency of recurrent microbial infections. Decreased complement levels also are associated with an increased risk of developing an autoimmune disease. Both C3 and C4 levels are typically depressed in lupus while C3 alone is low in septicemia and infections caused by fungi or parasites such as malaria.
If the deficiency is due to an underlying acute or chronic condition, complement levels will usually return to normal if the underlying condition can be resolved.
Decreased complement activity may be seen with:

Recurrent microbial infections (usually bacterial)
Autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis
Hereditary angioedema
Acquired angioedema
Various types of kidney disease, including glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, membranous nephritis, and IgA nephropathy as well as kidney transplant rejection
Cirrhosis
Hepatitis
Malnutrition
Septicemia, shock
Serum sickness (immune complex disease)

Complement protein levels are usually increased, along with other unrelated proteins called acute phase reactants, during acute or chronic inflammation. These all usually return to normal when the underlying condition is resolved. However, complement proteins are rarely measured in these conditions, compared to the widely ordered C-reactive protein (CRP), and the relevance of their measurement in these situations is not reviewed here.
Increased complement activity may also be seen with:

Cancer (leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma)
Ulcerative colitis
Thyroiditis
Acute myocardial infarction
Sarcoidosis
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis




","



Increased and decreased complement levels will not tell a healthcare practitioner what is wrong with a patient, but they can give an indication that the immune system is involved with a condition.

Complement tests, most commonly C3 and C4, are used to determine whether deficiencies or abnormalities in the complement system are causing, or contributing to, a person's disease or condition. Total complement activity (CH50) may be ordered to look at the integrity of the entire classical complement pathway. Other complement components are ordered as needed to look for deficiencies.
Complement testing may be used to:

Help diagnose the cause of recurrent microbial infections (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, Neisseria gonorrhea), angioedema, or inflammation

The complete blood count (CBC) is a group of tests that evaluate the cells that circulate in blood, including red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs). The CBC can evaluate your overall health and detect a variety of diseases and conditions, such as infections, anemia and leukemia.
Blood cells are produced and mature primarily in the bone marrow and, under normal circumstances, are released into the bloodstream as needed. The three types of cells evaluated by the CBC include:
Red Blood Cells
Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and released into the bloodstream when they mature. They contain hemoglobin, a protein that transports oxygen throughout the body. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus, the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect the production of new RBCs and/or their lifespan, in addition to those conditions that may result in significant bleeding.
RBCs normally are uniform in size and shape, but their appearance can be affected by a variety of conditions, such as vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies and iron deficiency. An example of a common condition affecting RBCs is anemia, which results from low red blood cell counts and low hemoglobin. Various diseases can lead to anemia, so additional tests are often needed to determine the cause. For more details, see the articles on Red Blood Cell Count, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit.
White Blood Cells
White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are cells that exist in the blood, the lymphatic system, and tissues and are an important part of the body's natural defense (immune) system. They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, and allergic reactions. There are five different types of WBCs and each has a different function. They include neutrophils, lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils, and monocytes.
WBCs are present in the blood at relatively stable numbers. However, these numbers may temporarily shift higher or lower depending on what is going on in the body. For instance, an infection can stimulate your bone marrow to produce a higher number of neutrophils to fight off a bacterial infection. With allergies, there may be an increased number of eosinophils. An increased number of lymphocytes may be produced with a viral infection. In certain diseases, such as leukemia, abnormal (immature or mature) white cells may rapidly multiply. For additional details, see the articles White Blood Cell Count and WBC Differential.
Platelets
Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are actually tiny cell fragments that circulate in blood and are essential for normal blood clotting. When there is an injury and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding by adhering to the injury site and clumping together to form a temporary plug. They also release chemical signals that attract and promote clumping of additional platelets and eventually become part of a stable blood clot at the site of the injury that remains in place until the injury heals.
If you have a disease or condition that causes low platelets (thrombocytopenia) or dysfunction of platelets, you may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. An excess of platelets (thrombocytosis) can cause excessive clotting. For more information, see the article Platelet Count.

The CBC is a very common test. You may have a CBC performed when you have a routine health examination.
A CBC may be ordered when you are ill and/or have signs and symptoms that may be related to conditions that affect blood cells. The test may be ordered when you have fatigue or weakness, or easy bruising or bleeding, or when you have signs and symptoms suggesting an infection or inflammation, to name a few examples.
When you have been diagnosed with a disease known to affect blood cells, a CBC will often be ordered on a regular basis to monitor the status of your disease/condition. Likewise, if you are being treated for a blood-related disorder, then a CBC may be performed frequently to determine if the treatment is effective.
Some therapies, such as chemotherapy, can affect bone marrow production of cells. Some medications can decrease WBC counts overall. A CBC may be ordered on a regular basis to monitor these drug treatments.



","



A healthcare practitioner typically evaluates and interprets results from the components of the CBC together. Depending on the purpose of the test, a number of additional or follow-up tests may be ordered for further investigation.
For additional details, see the tables in the section Details on CBC Results below that briefly and generally explain what the result for each component of the CBC may mean.
To see an example of a CBC lab report, see this sample report.



","



Many different conditions can result in increases or decreases in blood cell populations. Some of these conditions may require treatment, while others may resolve on their own.
Recent blood transfusions affect the results of the CBC.
Normal reference CBC values for babies and children are different from adults. The laboratory will supply the reference intervals for various age groups, and a healthcare practitioner will take these into consideration when interpreting data.



","



The complete blood count (CBC) is often used as a broad screening test to determine your general health status. A CBC may be used to:

Screen for a wide range of conditions and diseases
Help diagnose various diseases and conditions, such as anemia, infection, inflammation, bleeding disorder or leukemia, to name just a few
Monitor the status of a disease or condition and the effectiveness of treatment after a diagnosis is established
Monitor treatment that is known to adversely affect blood cells, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy

No test preparation is required, but some CGM devices require that twice daily blood glucose self-checks also be performed.

To monitor your blood sugar (glucose) levels; to evaluate changes and trends in your glucose levels over time


","

A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device includes a small sensor wire that is inserted beneath the skin of the abdomen or the upper arm and held in place with an adhesive patch. The sensor measures glucose in the space around cells (interstitial space). CGM measures glucose at frequent intervals and sends the results wirelessly to a device that is attached to your clothing or in some cases to a smart phone. These digital readouts let you know your equivalent blood glucose level in real time.


","



Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) measures the glucose in the space surrounding cells (interstitial space). CGM measures glucose every few minutes to track changes in glucose levels in real time. Blood and interstitial fluid glucose levels are not exactly the same, but they mirror each other closely.
Glucose is the primary energy source for the body's cells and the only short-term energy source for the brain and nervous system. A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.
During digestion, the carbohydrates that you eat are broken down into glucose (and other nutrients). They are absorbed by the digestive tract, move into the blood and circulate throughout the body. Normally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and the hormone insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response. The amount of insulin released corresponds to the size and content of the meal. Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. As glucose moves into the cells and is broken down (metabolized), the blood glucose level drops and the pancreas responds by decreasing the release of insulin.
If the glucose/insulin blood feedback system is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the feedback system is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance by increasing insulin production.
Diabetes is the most common disease resulting from an imbalance between glucose and insulin. Type 1 diabetes results when the body is not able to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels. Usually in type 1 diabetes, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells) have been destroyed by the person's own immune system. Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance (the body does not react normally to insulin) and a relative decline in insulin production.
People with diabetes who use insulin to help control blood glucose levels must self-check their blood glucose several times a day. Traditionally, this has been done using fingersticks, and then adjusting their insulin doses based upon the glucose readings. This can add up to many needle sticks a day. Also, this type of monitoring provides glucose readings only at the time of testing and not continuously.
CGM has been developed to give you and your healthcare practitioner a better understanding of how your glucose levels vary throughout the day. It gives you an opportunity to gain better control of your blood glucose, with fewer incidences of high and low sugars and a more timely response to them.
Different versions of CGM devices are available and they are continuing to improve. CGM devices are intended primarily for people with type 1 diabetes but are also being used by some people with type 2 diabetes who use insulin. They are FDA approved for use in adults and teens and some are approved for use in children.
CGM Devices
Some features of CGM devices include:

A device with a small sensor wire that is inserted beneath the skin of the abdomen or the upper arm and then held in place by an adhesive patch. This CGM device stays in place for several days (7, 10, or 14). One device has a sensor that is implanted in the upper arm for up to 3 months with a transmitter above it on top of the skin. When the time limits have been met, the CGM devices are removed and another new device is attached/implanted.
The CGM device measures interstitial glucose every few minutes and sends it to a receiver or in some cases to a smart phone or tablet. The devices can store the data, then download it. Software can be used to create reports of the data that can then be evaluated by the person and by a healthcare practitioner.
	
Most CGM devices measure and display glucose ""real-time"" readings automatically at set intervals, while some display the last glucose result performed when they are scanned (intermittent scanning or flash).
CGM devices may send alerts and have alarms. They may indicate when glucose is high or low, or give alerts based on trend data – such as the glucose is decreasing and likely to be low within the next 60 minutes.
Personal CGM devices provide the results to the person wearing the device and may also be set up to provide the results to several other people at the same time, such as sending alerts and results to a parent or healthcare practitioner as text messages.
Professional CGM devices may be masked, in which case they collect the data but do not show it real-time to the person wearing the device. Data is downloaded by the healthcare practitioner, then discussed with the patient. Unmasked versions collect this data but also have a display that the person can read.



One use of CGM is in conjunction with an insulin pump. When you eat and your glucose level rises, your CGM device measures glucose levels. Controls in the insulin pump react to this result to deliver insulin. Originally approved in adults and teens, these systems can now be used in children as young as 7 and are being studied in younger children.

When you have diabetes and require several self-checks a day to monitor blood glucose levels and adjust insulin doses; when you and your healthcare provider want to evaluate changes in your glucose levels over specified periods of time; when you have frequent low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), especially when you do not experience distinct symptoms (hypoglycemia unawareness)


","



Real-time CGM may be used daily and constantly to have better glucose control when you have type 1 diabetes. This may be when you are using intensive insulin regimens [e.g., frequent injections of insulin under the skin (subcutaneous) or a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] and/or when you are not meeting your hemoglobin A1c goals. In some cases, CGM may be used when you have type 2 diabetes and you are using insulin and require frequent glucose self-checks.
CGM may be used periodically when you have diabetes and your healthcare practitioner wants to collect and evaluate data on your day-to-day glucose variability and control.
CGM may be used when you have diabetes and hypoglycemia unawareness (no distinct symptoms) and/or frequent low or high blood glucose.



","



Glucose values from CGM devices generally correlate closely with blood glucose levels. Your target range for your glucose levels is determined by your healthcare practitioner and depends on several factors, such as:

How long you have had diabetes
Your age and life expectancy
Other underlying conditions you may have, including heart disease
Whether you do not experience distinct symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia unawareness)

CGM results can identify variability in glucose levels throughout the day, identify trends and anticipate when your glucose level is getting too low (hypoglycemia) or too high (hyperglycemia), sending an alert. It sends alarms when glucose levels reach the device manufacturer's established limit.
Looking at patterns of glucose data (such as data points collected over several days and graphed in a report) can help you and your healthcare practitioner evaluate variations in your glucose levels and suggest actions that may help stabilize glucose levels and improve glucose control.



","



At this time, most of the CGM devices still require two self-check blood glucoses a day for comparison and to ensure the CGM device is set to measure glucose correctly (calibration). Some also require you to verify a high or low CGM result with a self-check blood glucose before making a change in your treatment. These requirements are likely to change as the devices continue to improve.



","



CGM is not used by a majority of people with type 1 diabetes, but as CGM devices become increasingly accurate and user-friendly, their use is increasing.
CGM is primarily intended for adults, teens, and some children with type 1 diabetes and may also be useful for those with type 2 diabetes, especially those using insulin who are self-checking their glucose multiple times a day.
CGM is used to help maintain good glucose control on a daily basis and meet glycemic (hemoglobin A1c) goals. It is also used to anticipate and prevent episodes of hypoglycemia, especially if you experience them frequently and/or have no distinct warning symptoms (hypoglycemia unawareness).
Recent recommendations on CGM from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) ""Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes"" include the following:

Real-time CGM is a useful tool when used properly with intensive insulin regimens to lower hemoglobin A1c levels in type 1 diabetic adults who are not meeting their glycemic goals.
CGM may be useful in diabetic adults with frequent hypoglycemic episodes and/or with hypoglycemia unawareness.
Real-time CGM should be considered in children and teens with type 1 diabetes to help improve glucose control and reduce risks of hypoglycemia.
Diabetes education, training, and support are important for ongoing CGM use.
When used, CGM should be used as close as possible to daily for maximal benefit.
Real-time CGM may be used to help improve A1C levels and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes.
Intermittently scanned CGM may be considered as a substitute for glucose self-monitoring in adults with diabetes who require frequent glucose testing. In this technology, the meter collects the glucose level measurements but does not display these measurements in real-time.

","

To measure the amount of copper in your blood, urine, or liver tissue; to help diagnose and monitor Wilson disease; sometimes to identify copper deficiency or excess


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein and/or a 24-hour urine sample is collected. Care must be taken, especially with a 24-hour urine sample, not to contaminate the sample with an external source of copper. Talk to your healthcare practitioner and/or the laboratory that will perform the test about necessary precautions. If a urine or blood copper test result is higher than expected, your healthcare practitioner may have the test repeated with a new sample to confirm the findings. Sometimes a healthcare practitioner performs a liver biopsy.


","



Copper is an essential mineral that the body incorporates into enzymes. These enzymes play a role in the regulation of iron metabolism, formation of connective tissue, energy production within cells, the production of melanin (the pigment that produces skin color), and the function of the nervous system. This test measures the amount of copper in the blood, urine, or liver (hepatic).
Copper is found in many foods including nuts, chocolate, mushrooms, shellfish, whole grains, dried fruits, and liver. Drinking water may acquire copper as it flows through copper pipes, and food may acquire it when people cook or serve food in copper dishes.

Normally, the body absorbs copper from food or liquids in the intestines, converts it to a non-toxic form by binding it to a protein, and transports it to the liver.
The liver stores some of the copper and binds most of the rest to another protein called apoceruloplasmin to produce the enzyme ceruloplasmin. About 95% of the copper in the blood is bound to ceruloplasmin, and most of the rest is bound to other proteins such as albumin.
Only a small amount is normally present in the blood in a free (unbound) state.
The liver eliminates excess copper into the bile and it is removed from the body in the stool. Some copper is also eliminated in the urine.

Both excess and deficiency of copper are rare. Wilson disease, a rare inherited disorder, can lead to excess storage of copper in the eyes, liver, brain, and other organs. Copper excess (toxicity) can also occur with absorbing large amounts over a short period of time (acute exposure) or various amounts over a long period (chronic exposure).
Copper deficiency may occasionally occur in conditions associated with severe malabsorption, such as cystic fibrosis and celiac disease, and in infants exclusively fed cow-milk formulas. It can also occur in malnourished children as well as people who megadose zinc-containing vitamins.
A rare X-linked genetic condition called Menkes kinky hair syndrome leads to copper deficiency in the brain and liver of affected infants. The disease, which affects primarily males, is associated with seizures, delayed development, abnormal artery development in the brain, and unusual gray brittle kinky hair.

When you have jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, behavioral changes, tremors, or other symptoms that a healthcare practitioner thinks may be due to Wilson disease or, rarely, to copper deficiency or excess; at intervals when you are being treated for a copper-related condition


","



One or more copper tests are ordered along with ceruloplasmin when you have signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to Wilson disease, excess copper storage, or copper poisoning. These signs and symptoms may include:

Anemia 
Nausea, abdominal pain
Jaundice
Fatigue
Behavioral changes
Tremors
Difficulty walking
Persistent involuntary muscle contractions that cause repetitive or twisting motions (dystonia)
Diarrhea and vomiting
Trouble swallowing or speaking
Dark brown rings around the iris of the eyes (Kayser-Fleischer rings)

Testing may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms that may be due to a copper deficiency, such as:

Abnormally low numbers of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell (neutropenia)
Osteoporosis
Anemia
Less commonly, neurologic symptoms and delayed growth in children

One or more of the copper tests may be ordered periodically when monitoring is recommended.
A hepatic (liver) copper test may be ordered to further investigate copper storage when copper and ceruloplasmin results are abnormal or equivocal.



","



Copper test results must be evaluated in context and are usually compared to ceruloplasmin levels. Abnormal copper results are not diagnostic of a specific condition; they indicate the need for further investigation. Interpretation can be complicated by the fact that ceruloplasmin is an acute phase reactant – it may be elevated whenever inflammation or severe infections are present. Both ceruloplasmin and copper are also increased during pregnancy and with estrogen and oral contraceptive use.
Test results may include:

*Excess copper in the liver is often unevenly distributed and may not be detected in a sample.

Low blood copper concentrations along with increased urine copper levels, low ceruloplasmin levels, and increased hepatic copper are typically seen with Wilson disease.
Increased blood and urine copper concentrations and normal or increased ceruloplasmin levels may indicate exposure to excess copper or may be associated with conditions that decrease copper excretion, such as chronic liver disease, or that release copper from tissues, such as acute hepatitis. Increased hepatic copper may be present with chronic conditions. 
Decreased blood and urine copper concentrations and decreased ceruloplasmin may indicate a copper deficiency. 
A normal hepatic copper test may indicate that copper metabolism is functioning properly or that the distribution of copper in the liver is uneven and the sample is not representative of the person's condition.

If you are being treated for Wilson disease or copper toxicity with drugs that bind copper (chelators), then your 24-hour urine copper levels may be high until body copper stores decrease. Eventually, blood copper and 24-hour urine copper levels should return to normal.
If you are treated for a condition related to copper deficiency and your ceruloplasmin and total copper levels rise, then the condition is likely responding to the treatment.



","



Medications such as carbamazepine and phenobarbital can increase blood copper levels. They may also be elevated with rheumatoid arthritis and with some cancers and decreased with a variety of conditions associated with malabsorption, such as cystic fibrosis.
Total serum copper concentrations are normally low at birth, rise over the next few years, peak, and then decline slightly to a relatively stable level.



","



Copper testing is primarily used to help diagnose Wilson disease, a rare inherited disorder that can lead to excess storage of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs. Less commonly, a copper test may be used to detect copper excess due to another condition, to detect a copper deficiency, or to monitor treatment for one of these conditions.
Typically, a total blood copper test is ordered along with a ceruloplasmin level. If the results from these tests are abnormal or unclear, then they may be followed by a 24-hour urine copper test to measure copper elimination and/or a copper test performed on a liver biopsy to evaluate copper storage in the liver.
Sometimes a free (unbound) blood copper test is also ordered. If Wilson disease is suspected, genetic testing may be performed to detect mutations in the ATP7B gene. However, these tests have limited availability and are usually performed in special reference or research laboratories.
Rarely, a copper test may be used to help diagnose Menkes kinky hair syndrome, a rare inherited disorder of copper transport dysfunction (see below).

cortisol,"['Urinary Cortisol', 'Salivary Cortisol', 'Free Cortisol', 'Dexamethasone Suppression Test', 'DST', 'ACTH Stimulation Test']","

You may be required to rest before sample collection. For a salivary cortisol test, you may be instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth for a period of time (may be some time between 15 to 30 minutes) prior to the test. Follow any instructions you are given.

To help diagnose Cushing syndrome or primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease); to detect conditions affecting the pituitary or adrenal glands


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a random or 24-hour urine sample; sometimes a saliva sample may be used


","



Cortisol is a hormone that plays a role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. It affects blood glucose levels, helps maintain blood pressure, and helps regulate the immune system. Most cortisol in the blood is bound to a protein; only a small percentage is ""free"" and biologically active. Free cortisol is secreted into the urine and is present in the saliva. This test measures the amount of cortisol in the blood, urine, or saliva.
The level of cortisol in the blood (as well as the urine and saliva) normally rises and falls in a ""diurnal variation"" pattern. It peaks early in the morning, then declines throughout the day, reaching its lowest level about midnight. This pattern can change when a person works irregular shifts (such as the night shift) and sleeps at different times of the day, and it can become disrupted when a disease or condition either limits or stimulates cortisol production.
Cortisol is produced and secreted by the adrenal glands, two triangular organs that sit on top of the kidneys. Production of the hormone is regulated by the hypothalamus in the brain and by the pituitary gland, a tiny organ located below the brain. When the blood cortisol level falls, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which directs the pituitary gland to produce ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol. In order for appropriate amounts of cortisol to be made, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands must be functioning properly.
The group of signs and symptoms that are seen with an abnormally high level of cortisol is called Cushing syndrome. Increased cortisol production may be seen with:

Administration of large amounts of glucocorticosteroid hormones (such as prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone) to treat a variety of conditions, such as autoimmune disease and some tumors
ACTH-producing tumors, in the pituitary gland and/or in other parts of the body
Increased cortisol production by the adrenal glands, due to a tumor or due to excessive growth of adrenal tissues (hyperplasia)
Rarely, with tumors in various parts of the body that produce CRH

Decreased cortisol production may be seen with:

An underactive pituitary gland or a pituitary gland tumor that inhibits ACTH production; this is known as secondary adrenal insufficiency.
Underactive or damaged adrenal glands (adrenal insufficiency) that limit cortisol production; this is referred to as primary adrenal insufficiency and is also known as Addison disease.
After stopping treatment with glucocorticosteroid hormones, especially if stopped very quickly after a long period of use

How is the sample collected for testing?
Typically, blood will be drawn from a vein in the arm, but sometimes urine or saliva may be tested. Cortisol blood tests may be drawn at about 8 am, when cortisol should be at its peak, and again at about 4 pm, when the level should have dropped significantly.
Sometimes a resting sample will be obtained to measure cortisol when it should be at its lowest level (just before sleep); this is often done by measuring cortisol in saliva rather than blood to make it easier to obtain the sample. Saliva for cortisol testing is usually collected by inserting a swab into the mouth and waiting a few minutes while the swab becomes saturated with saliva. Obtaining more than one sample allows the health practitioner to evaluate the daily pattern of cortisol secretion (the diurnal variation).
Sometimes urine is tested for cortisol; this usually requires collecting all of the urine produced during a day and night (a 24-hour urine) but sometimes may be done on a single sample of urine collected in the morning.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Some test preparation may be needed. Follow any instructions that are given as far as timing of sample collection, resting, and/or any other specific pre-test preparation.
A saliva test requires special care in obtaining the sample. You may be instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth for a period of time (may be some time between 15 to 30 minutes) prior to the test. Follow any specific instructions that are provided.
A stimulation or suppression test requires that you have a baseline blood sample drawn and then a specified amount of drug is given. Subsequent blood samples are drawn at specified times.

When your healthcare provider suspects excess or deficient cortisol production

A cortisol test may be ordered when a person has symptoms that suggest a high level of cortisol and Cushing syndrome, such as

High blood pressure (hypertension)
High blood sugar (glucose)
Obesity, especially in the trunk
Fragile skin
Purple streaks on the abdomen
Muscle wasting and weakness
Osteoporosis

Testing may be ordered when women have irregular menstrual periods and increased facial hair; children may have delayed development and a short stature.
This test may be ordered when someone has symptoms suggestive of a low level of cortisol, adrenal insufficiency, or Addison disease, such as:

Weight loss
Muscle weakness
Fatigue
Low blood pressure
Abdominal pain
Dark patches of skin (this occurs in Addison disease but not secondary adrenal insufficiency)

Sometimes decreased production combined with a stressor can cause an adrenal crisis that can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms of a crisis may include:

Sudden onset of severe pain in the lower back, abdomen, or legs
Vomiting and diarrhea, resulting in dehydration
Low blood pressure (hypotension)
Loss of consciousness

Suppression or stimulation testing is ordered when initial findings are abnormal. Cortisol testing may be ordered at intervals after a diagnosis of Cushing syndrome or Addison disease to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.



","



Normally, cortisol levels are very low at bedtime and at their highest just after waking, though this pattern will change if a person works rotating shifts and sleeps at different times on different days.
An increased or normal cortisol level just after waking along with a level that does not drop by bedtime suggests excess cortisol and Cushing syndrome. If this excess cortisol is not suppressed after an overnight dexamethasone suppression test, or if the 24-hour urine cortisol is elevated, or if the late-night salivary cortisol level is elevated, it suggests that the excess cortisol is due to abnormal increased ACTH production by the pituitary or a tumor outside of the pituitary or abnormal production by the adrenal glands. Additional testing will help to determine the exact cause. (See the section ""How is it used?"" above.)
If insufficient cortisol is present and the person tested responds to an ACTH stimulation test, then the problem is likely due to insufficient ACTH production by the pituitary. If the person does not respond to the ACTH stimulation test, then it is more likely that the problem is based in the adrenal glands. If the adrenal glands are underactive, due to pituitary dysfunction and/or insufficient ACTH production, then the person is said to have secondary adrenal insufficiency. If decreased cortisol production is due to adrenal damage, then the person is said to have primary adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease.
Once an abnormality has been identified and associated with the pituitary gland, adrenal glands, or other cause, then the health practitioner may use other testing such as CT (computerized tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans to locate the source of the excess (such as a pituitary, adrenal, or other tumor) and to evaluate the extent of any damage to the glands.



","



Similar to those with adrenal insufficiency, people with a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) have low cortisol levels and do not respond to ACTH stimulation tests. Cortisol measurement is one of many tests that may be used to help evaluate a person for CAH.
Heat, cold, infection, trauma, exercise, obesity, and debilitating disease can influence cortisol concentrations. Pregnancy, physical and emotional stress, and illness can increase cortisol levels. Cortisol levels may also increase as a result of hyperthyroidism or obesity. A number of drugs can also increase levels, particularly oral contraceptives (birth control pills), hydrocortisone (the synthetic form of cortisol), and spironolactone.
Adults have slightly higher cortisol levels than children do.
Hypothyroidism may decrease cortisol levels. Drugs that may decrease levels include some steroid hormones.
Salivary cortisol testing is being used more frequently to help diagnose Cushing syndrome and stress-related disorders but still requires specialized expertise to perform.

A cortisol test may be used to help diagnose Cushing syndrome, a condition associated with excess cortisol, or to help diagnose adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease, conditions associated with deficient cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone that plays a role in the metabolism of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, among other functions. Normally, the level of cortisol in the blood rises and falls in a ""diurnal variation"" pattern, peaking early in the morning, then declining throughout the day and reaching its lowest level about midnight.
Cortisol is produced and secreted by the adrenal glands. Production of the hormone is regulated by the hypothalamus in the brain and by the pituitary gland, a tiny organ located below the brain. When the blood cortisol level falls, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which directs the pituitary gland to produce ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). ACTH stimulates the adrenal glands to produce and release cortisol. In order for appropriate amounts of cortisol to be made, the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal glands must be functioning properly. (See the ""What is being tested?"" section for more.)
Most cortisol in the blood is bound to a protein; only a small percentage is ""free"" and biologically active. Blood cortisol testing evaluates both protein-bound and free cortisol while urine and saliva testing evaluate only free cortisol, which should correlate with the levels of free cortisol in the blood. Multiple blood and/or saliva cortisol levels collected at different times, such as at 8 am and 4 pm, can be used to evaluate both cortisol levels and diurnal variation. A 24-hour urine cortisol sample will not show diurnal variation; it will measure the total amount of unbound cortisol excreted in 24 hours.
If an abnormal level of cortisol is detected, a health practitioner will do additional testing to help confirm the findings and to help determine its cause:
Testing for Excess Cortisol Production 
If a person has a high blood cortisol level, a health practitioner may perform additional testing to confirm that the high cortisol is truly abnormal (and not simply due to increased stress or the use of cortisol-like medication). This additional testing may include measuring the 24-hour urinary cortisol, doing an overnight dexamethasone suppression test, and/or collecting a salivary sample before retiring in order to measure cortisol at the time that it should be the lowest. Urinary cortisol requires the collection of urine over a timed period, usually 24 hours. Since ACTH is secreted by the pituitary gland in pulses, this test helps determine whether the elevated blood cortisol level represents a real increase.
Dexamethasone suppression: The dexamethasone suppression test involves analyzing a baseline sample for cortisol, then giving the person oral dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) and measuring cortisol levels in subsequent timed samples. Dexamethasone suppresses ACTH production and should decrease cortisol production if the source of the excess is stress.
Collecting a salivary sample for cortisol measurement is a convenient way to determine whether the normal rhythm of cortisol production is altered. If one or more of these tests confirms that there is abnormal cortisol production, then additional testing, including measuring ACTH, repeating the dexamethasone suppression test using higher doses, and radiologic imaging may be ordered.
Testing for Insufficient Cortisol Production 
If a health practitioner suspects that the adrenal glands may not be producing adequate cortisol or if the initial blood tests indicate insufficient cortisol production, the health practitioner may order an ACTH stimulation test.
ACTH stimulation: This test involves measuring the level of cortisol in a person's blood before and after an injection of synthetic ACTH. If the adrenal glands are functioning normally, then cortisol levels will rise with the ACTH stimulation. If they are damaged or not functioning properly, then the cortisol level will be low. A longer version of this test (1-3 days) may be performed to help distinguish between adrenal and pituitary insufficiency.

In the pancreas, within specialized cells called beta cells, proinsulin, a biologically inactive molecule, is split apart to form one molecule of C-peptide and one molecule of insulin. Insulin is vital for the transport of glucose into the body's cells and is required on a daily basis. When insulin is released from the beta cells into the blood in response to increased levels of glucose, equal amounts of C-peptide are also released. Since C-peptide is produced at the same rate as insulin, it is useful as a marker of insulin production.
In particular, C-peptide testing can be used to help evaluate the production of insulin made by the body (endogenous) and to help differentiate it from insulin taken in as diabetic medication (exogenous) which not generate C-peptide. This test may be done in conjunction with an insulin test or a glucose test.

When you have diabetes and your health practitioner wants to determine if you are producing enough of your own insulin or there is an absolute need for insulin injections or an insulin pump; when your health practitioner suspects that you have insulin resistance or your diabetes has been incorrectly classified; when you have documented hypoglycemia and your health practitioner is investigating causes.


","



C-peptide levels may be ordered when there is documented acute or recurring low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) and/or excess insulin is suspected. C-peptide tests help distinguish the body's own insulin from outside sources of insulin. Symptoms of hypoglycemia include:

Sweating
Palpitations
Hunger
Confusion
Blurred vision
Fainting
In severe cases, seizures and loss of consciousness

However, many of these symptoms can occur with other conditions as well. 
A C-peptide test may be ordered periodically when you have been diagnosed with an insulinoma to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to detect tumor recurrence.
C-peptide levels may be ordered when the healthcare provider wishes to assess whether a person with diabetes still requires insulin injections or can switch to a different type of medication. This is more commonly part of the management of type 1 diabetes, but may be useful in knowing when patients with type 2 diabetes have developed an absolute insulin requirement. If a healthcare provider is suspecting incorrect classification of a person’s diabetes, the test may be ordered.
Rarely, C-peptide levels may be monitored over time when you have had your pancreas removed or have had pancreas islet cell transplants.



","



A high level of C-peptide generally indicates a high level of endogenous insulin production. This may be in response to a high blood glucose caused by glucose intake and/or insulin resistance. A high level of C-peptide is also seen with insulinomas and may be seen with low blood potassium, Cushing syndrome, and renal failure.
A low level of C-peptide is associated with a low level of insulin production. This can occur when insufficient insulin is being produced by the beta cells, with diabetes for example, or when production is suppressed by treatment with exogenous insulin.
Absent C-peptide means there is an absolute requirement for insulin from an outside source.
When used for monitoring someone diagnosed with an insulinoma, decreasing levels of C-peptide indicate a response to treatment. Levels that increase may indicate that a tumor has come back (recurrence).
When used for managing your diabetes, the meaning of a value must be considered in context of your type of diabetes and the type of treatment you are currently receiving. With all the information, your healthcare practitioner can determine whether or not a change in treatment is necessary.



","



C-peptide testing has become more widely available, though there is still some method variability. If a series of C-peptide tests are going to be performed, they should be done at the same laboratory using the same method.
Even though they are produced at the same rate, C-peptide and insulin leave the body by different routes. Insulin is processed and eliminated mostly by the liver, while C-peptide is removed by the kidneys. Since the half-life of C-peptide is longer than insulin, its levels in the blood are higher than insulin, making it a more reliable measure of insulin production.



","



While not a regularly ordered lab test, C-peptide testing can be very useful in certain medical situations. Additionally, with the rising incidence of type 2 diabetes in younger patients and newer medications aimed at preserving insulin production, the test will likely become more important.
The following are some uses of C-peptide testing:

To evaluate the cause of documented hypoglycemia Symptoms of hypoglycemia may be caused by excessive supplementation of insulin, alcohol consumption, inherited liver enzyme deficiencies, liver or kidney disease, or by insulinomas. Insulinomas are tumors of the islet cells in the pancreas that can produce uncontrolled amounts of insulin and C-peptide and can cause acute episodes of hypoglycemia. • To monitor the effectiveness of insulinoma treatment and to detect its recurrence
To assist in management of people with diabetes treated with insulin. Most insulin tests are not able to distinguish between the body’s own insulin and that given by injections, but C-peptide levels reflect only the insulin being produced by the body’s own functioning beta cells. Additionally, people taking insulin may produce antibodies against insulin that could interfere with insulin testing, but not with C-peptide testing. Knowing how much C-peptide (and thus insulin) is being produced by the beta cells may allow healthcare practitioners to know when insulin is absolutely required and when it may be safe to switch to a different type of treatment.
To assist in classification of diabetes in select cases Generally, type 1 and type 2 diabetes will be classified without this test. However, with increased prevalence of obesity in teens and the understanding of other types of diabetes, some people with diabetes may be difficult to classify and/or classified incorrectly. Measurement of a C-peptide 3-5 years from diagnosis can assist in classification.
When you have had your pancreas removed or have had pancreas islet cell transplants, intended to restore the ability to make insulin, C-peptide levels may be used to verify the effectiveness of treatment and continued success of the procedure.

c-reactive-protein-crp,['CRP'],"

","

To identify the presence of inflammation and to monitor response to treatment for an inflammatory disorder


","

A blood sample taken from a vein


","



C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein made by the liver. CRP levels in the blood increase when there is a condition causing inflammation somewhere in the body. A CRP test measures the amount of CRP in the blood to detect inflammation due to acute conditions or to monitor the severity of disease in chronic conditions.
CRP is a non-specific indicator of inflammation and one of the most sensitive acute phase reactants. That means that it is released into the blood within a few hours after an injury, the start of an infection, or other cause of inflammation. Markedly increased levels can occur, for example, after trauma or a heart attack, with active or untreated autoimmune disorders, and with serious bacterial infections, such as in sepsis. The level of CRP can jump as much as a thousand-fold in response to bacterial infection, and its rise in the blood can precede pain, fever, or other signs and symptoms.
The CRP test is not diagnostic, but it provides information to your healthcare practitioner as to whether inflammation is present, without identifying the source of the inflammation. This information can be used in conjunction with other factors such as signs and symptoms, physical exam, and other tests to determine if you have an acute inflammatory condition or are experiencing a flare-up of a chronic inflammatory disease. Your healthcare practitioner may then follow up with further testing and treatment.
This standard CRP test is not to be confused with an hs-CRP test. These are two different tests that measure CRP and each test measures a different range of CRP level in the blood for different purposes:

The standard CRP test measures high levels of the protein observed in diseases that cause significant inflammation. It measures CRP in the range from 8 to 1000 mg/L (or 0.8 to 100 mg/dL).
The hs-CRP test precisely detects lower levels of the protein than that measured by the standard CRP test and is used to evaluate individuals for risk of cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in the range from 0.3 to 10 mg/L. (See the article on hs-CRP.)

When your healthcare provider suspects that you have an acute condition causing inflammation, such as a serious bacterial or fungal infection or when you are suffering from an inflammatory disorder such as arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, or inflammatory bowel disease


","



The CRP test may be ordered when it is suspected that you have a serious bacterial infection based on your medical history and signs and symptoms. It may be ordered, for example, when a newborn shows signs of infection or when you have symptoms of sepsis, such as:

Fever, chills 
Rapid breathing
Rapid heart rate


It may also be ordered on a regular basis to monitor conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and is often repeated at intervals to determine whether treatment is effective. This is particularly useful for inflammation problems since CRP levels drop as inflammation subsides.
It is also ordered and monitored after surgery to ensure that you are free of post-surgery infection.



","



The level of CRP in the blood is normally low. 
Increased CRP level:

A high or increasing amount of CRP in the blood suggests the presence of inflammation but will not identify its location or the cause.
Suspected bacterial infection—a high CRP level can provide confirmation that you have a serious bacterial infection.
Chronic inflammatory disease—high levels of CRP suggest a flare-up if you have a chronic inflammatory disease or that treatment has not been effective.


If the CRP level is initially elevated and drops, it means that the inflammation or infection is subsiding and/or responding to treatment.



","



CRP levels can be elevated in the later stages of pregnancy as well as with use of birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy (i.e., estrogen). Higher levels of CRP have also been observed in people who are obese. CRP can also be increased in people who have cancer.
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) test will also be increased in the presence of inflammation; however, CRP increases sooner and then decreases more rapidly than the ESR.



","



The C-reactive protein (CRP) test is used to detect inflammation.
For example, CRP may be used to detect or monitor significant inflammation in acute conditions, such as:

A serious bacterial infection of the lung, urinary tract, digestive tract, skin, or other sites, with or without sepsis
A fungal or viral infection
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)


The CRP test is useful in monitoring chronic inflammatory conditions to detect flare-ups and/or to determine if treatment is effective. Some examples include:

Inflammatory bowel disease
Some forms of arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis
Autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or vasculitis


Examples of other uses:

The CRP test is widely used to detect sepsis in newborn babies.
The CRP test may be used to monitor patients after surgery. Generally, CRP levels increase after surgery and drop down to normal unless post-surgery infection is present.
CRP can be a good predictor of rejection in kidney transplant recipients.


CRP may sometimes be ordered along with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), another test that detects inflammation, or procalcitonin, a test that indicates sepsis. While the CRP test is not specific enough to diagnose a particular disease, it does serve as a general marker for infection and inflammation, thus alerting healthcare practitioners that further testing and treatment may be necessary. Depending on the suspected cause, a number of other tests may be performed to identify the source of inflammation.

To detect and monitor muscle damage; to help diagnose conditions associated with muscle damage; for heart attack detection, this test has been largely replaced by troponin T and I – markers more specific to cardiac tissue; however, it may sometimes be used to help detect a second or subsequent heart attack (see Common Questions #4).

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in the heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and other tissues. Increased amounts of CK are released into the blood when there is muscle damage. This test measures the amount of creatine kinase in the blood.
The small amount of CK that is normally in the blood comes primarily from skeletal muscles. Any condition that causes muscle damage and/or interferes with muscle energy production or use can cause an increase in CK. For example, strenuous exercise and inflammation of muscles, called myositis, can increase CK as can muscle diseases (myopathies) such as muscular dystrophy. Rhabdomyolysis, an extreme breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, is associated with significantly elevated levels of CK.

","

When you have muscle weakness, muscle aches, and/or dark urine and your healthcare practitioner suspects muscle damage; sometimes to monitor for muscle injury resolution or persistence


","



A CK test may be ordered when muscle damage is suspected and at regular intervals to monitor for continued damage. It may be ordered when a muscle disease (myopathy) such as muscular dystrophy is suspected or when someone has experienced physical trauma, such as crushing injuries or extensive burns. The test may be ordered when a person has symptoms associated with muscle injury such as:

Muscle pain or aches
Muscle weakness
Dark urine (The urine may be dark because of the presence of myoglobin, another substance released by damaged muscles that can be harmful to the kidneys.)

Testing may be ordered when a person has nonspecific symptoms, especially when taking a drug or after an exposure to a substance that has been linked with potential muscle damage.



","



A high CK, or a rise in levels in subsequent samples, generally indicates that there has been some recent muscle damage but will not indicate its location or cause. Serial test results that peak and then begin to drop indicate that new muscle damage has diminished, while increasing and persistent elevations suggest continued damage.
Increased CK levels may be seen in some muscular disorders (myopathies), which have a wide variety of causes. People may have CK levels that are significantly to greatly increased, depending upon the severity of muscle damage. Those who have rhabdomyolysis may have CK levels that are 100 times normal levels and occasionally even higher.
Increased CK may be seen with, for example:

Recent crush and compression muscle injuries, trauma, burns, and electrocution
Inherited myopathies, such as muscular dystrophy
Hormonal (endocrine) disorders, such as thyroid disorders, Addison disease or Cushing disease
Strenuous exercise
Prolonged surgeries
Seizures
Infections – viral (such as influenza and HIV), bacterial, fungal, and parasitic (such as malaria)
Connective tissue disorders (e.g. lupus, rheumatoid arthritis)
Celiac disease
Renal failure
In critically ill patients
High fever accompanied by shivering
A blood clot (thrombosis) blocking the flow of blood
Any drug or toxin that interferes with muscle energy production or increases energy requirements

Normal CK levels may indicate that there has not been muscle damage or that it occurred several days prior to testing.
Moderately increased CK levels may be seen following strenuous exercise such as in weight lifting, contact sports, or long exercise sessions.



","



People who have greater muscle mass have higher CK levels than those who don't; for this reason, men generally tend to have higher values than women.
Any kind of muscle damage, including shots (injections), can temporarily increase CK.
A low CK level may be seen in early pregnancy.



",,"



A creatine kinase (CK) test may be used to detect inflammation of muscles (myositis) or muscle damage due to muscle disorders (myopathies) such as muscular dystrophy or to help diagnose rhabdomyolysis if a person has signs and symptoms. CK may be ordered along with other blood chemistry tests such as electrolytes, BUN or creatinine (to evaluate kidney function). A urine myoglobin may also be ordered.
A person may have muscle injury with few or nonspecific symptoms, such as weakness, fever, and nausea, that may also be seen with a variety of other conditions. A healthcare practitioner may use a CK test to help detect muscle damage in these cases, especially if someone is taking a drug such as a statin, using ethanol or cocaine, or has been exposed to a known toxin that has been linked with potential muscle damage. In those who have experienced physical trauma, a CK test may sometimes be used to evaluate and monitor muscle damage.
A series of CK tests may be used to monitor muscle damage to see if it resolves or continues. If a CK is elevated and the location of the muscle damage is unclear, then a healthcare practitioner may order CK isoenzymes or a CK-MB as follow-up tests, to distinguish between the three types (isoenzymes) of CK: CK-MB (found primarily in heart muscle), CK-MM (found primarily in skeletal muscle), and CK-BB (found primarily in the brain; when present in the blood, it is primarily from smooth muscles, including those in intestines, uterus or placenta).
The CK test was once one of the primary tests ordered to help diagnose a heart attack, but in the U.S., this use of CK has been largely replaced by the troponin test. However, the CK test may sometimes be used to help detect a second heart attack that occurs shortly after the first. (For more, see Common Questions #4.)

Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys, which filter almost all of it from the blood and release it into the urine. This test measures the amount of creatinine in the blood and/or urine.
Creatine is part of the cycle that produces energy needed to contract muscles. Both creatine and creatinine are produced by the body at a relatively constant rate. Since almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. The amount of creatinine you produce depends on your body size and your muscle mass. For this reason, creatinine levels are usually slightly higher in men than in women and children.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs that are located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back. Within them are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a microscopic cluster of looping blood vessels, called glomerulus. The glomerulus allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells and larger molecules. Attached to each glomerulus is a tiny tube (tubule) that collects the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus and then reabsorbs what still can be used by the body. The remaining waste forms urine.
Results from a blood creatinine test may be used in combination with results from other tests, such as a 24-hour urine creatinine test, to calculate values that are used to evaluate kidney function.

Creatinine may be ordered during a routine health exam. It may also be ordered when your healthcare practitioner suspects that your kidneys are not working properly due to your signs and symptoms. Some signs and symptoms of kidney dysfunction include:

Fatigue, lack of concentration, poor appetite, or trouble sleeping
Swelling or puffiness, particularly around the eyes or in the face, wrists, abdomen, thighs or ankles

Mid-back pain (flank), below the ribs, near where the kidneys are located
High blood pressure

The creatinine blood test may be ordered, along with a BUN test and urine albumin, at regular intervals when you have a known kidney disorder or a disease that may affect kidney function.
Both BUN and creatinine may be ordered when a CT scan is planned, prior to and during certain drug therapies, and before and after dialysis to monitor the effectiveness of treatments.



","



Results of creatinine tests are interpreted along with BUN results, and with other tests results that may have been performed at the same time, such as a renal panel.
BUN and creatinine levels that are within the ranges established by the laboratory performing the test suggest that your kidneys are functioning as they should.
Increased creatinine and BUN levels in the blood may mean that your kidneys are not working as they should. Your healthcare practitioner will consider other factors, such as your medical history and physical exam, to determine what, if any, condition may be affecting your kidneys.

Some examples of conditions that can increase creatinine levels include:

Damage to or swelling of blood vessels in the kidneys (glomerulonephritis) caused by, for example, infection or autoimmune diseases
Bacterial infection of the kidneys (pyelonephritis)
Death of cells in the kidneys' small tubes (acute tubular necrosis) caused by, for example, drugs or toxins
Conditions that can block the flow of urine in the urinary tract, such as prostate disease or kidney stone
Reduced blood flow to the kidney due to shock, dehydration, congestive heart failure, atherosclerosis, or complications of diabetes

Low blood levels of creatinine are not common and are not usually a cause for concern. They can be seen with conditions that result in decreased muscle mass. Levels of 24-hour urine creatinine are evaluated with blood levels as part of a creatinine clearance test.
Single, random urine creatinine levels have no standard reference ranges. These results are usually used as references for other substances measured in the urine and to calculate ratios. For example urine albumin results are compared to urine creatinine and a urine albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) is calculated to provide a more accurate indication of the how much albumin is being released into the urine. Elevated urine albumin may indicate kidney damage, but since the amount of albumin in the urine can vary considerably, an elevated ACR should be repeated twice within 3 to 6 months to confirm the diagnosis.

Creatinine blood levels can increase temporarily as a result of muscle injury and are generally slightly lower during pregnancy.
Some drugs may cause increased creatinine levels. Inform your healthcare provider of any drugs you are taking.

The creatinine blood test is used to assess kidney function. It is frequently ordered along with a BUN (blood urea nitrogen) test as part of a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel (BMP or CMP), groups of tests that are done to evaluate the health of your major organs. A BMP or CMP may be used to screen people during routine physical exams or to help evaluate people who seek medical care in the emergency room and/or are admitted to the hospital. Sometimes, creatinine may be performed as part of a renal panel to evaluate kidney function.
If the creatinine and BUN tests are found to be abnormal or if you have an underlying disease that is known to affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, then creatinine and BUN tests may be used to monitor your kidney function and the effectiveness of treatment.
Blood creatinine and BUN tests may also be ordered to evaluate kidney function prior to some procedures, such as a CT (computed tomography) scan, that may require the use of drugs that can damage the kidneys if not cleared rapidly.
Results from creatinine tests may be used to estimate the amount of blood filtered per minute by the kidneys. This is known as the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). GFR is difficult to measure directly. Estimated GFR is used to screen for and detect early kidney damage, to help diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to monitor kidney status.

Blood creatinine measurements, along with age, race, and sex, are used to calculate the eGFR. The National Kidney Disease Education Program, American Society of Nephrology, and the National Kidney Foundation all recommend that an eGFR be calculated every time a creatinine blood test is done.
Another, less common way to obtain GFR is to calculate creatinine clearance. There are several versions of the creatinine clearance calculation. All of them include the measurement of the amount of creatinine in a blood sample collected just before or after the urine collection, the amount of creatinine in a 24-hour urine sample, and the 24-hour urine volume.

Urine creatinine may also be used with a variety of other urine tests as a correction factor. The concentration (or dilution) of urine varies throughout the day, with more or less liquid being released in addition to the body's waste products. Since creatinine is produced and removed at a relatively constant rate, the amount of urine creatinine can be compared to the amount of another substance being measured. Examples include:

Urine albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR). This calculation more accurately determines how much albumin is escaping from the kidneys into the urine. It is used to screen people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) that put them at an increased risk of developing kidney disease.
Urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/CR). This calculation may be used to monitor a person with known kidney disease or damage or to screen people on a regular basis when they are taking a medication that may affect their kidney function.

Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine. A creatinine clearance test measures creatinine levels in both a sample of blood and a sample of urine from a 24-hour urine collection. The results are used to calculate the amount of creatinine that has been cleared from the blood and passed into the urine. This calculation allows for a general evaluation of the amount of blood that is being filtered by the kidneys in a 24-hour time period.
The amount of creatinine produced in the body is dependent on muscle mass and is relatively constant for an individual. The amount of creatinine removed from the blood depends on both the filtering ability of the kidneys and the rate at which blood is carried to the kidneys.
The amount of blood filtered per minute by the kidneys is known as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). If the kidneys are damaged or diseased, or if blood circulation is slowed, then less creatinine will be removed from the blood and released into the urine and the GFR will be decreased.
GFR is difficult to measure directly. Therefore, it is recommended to estimate GFR by measuring the creatinine level in the blood and using the results in an equation to calculate estimated GFR. The calculation that takes into account several factors, such as age, gender and race of the person tested (see the article on Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate).
Another, less common way to estimate GFR is to calculate creatinine clearance. There are several versions of the creatinine clearance calculation. All of them include the measurement of the amount of creatinine in a blood sample collected just before or after the urine collection, the amount of creatinine in a 24-hour urine sample, and the 24-hour urine volume. Since the amount of creatinine produced depends on muscle mass, some calculations also use a correction factor that takes into account a person's body surface area (using their height and weight).
How is the sample collected for testing?
The test requires a 24-hour urine collection and a blood sample drawn either at the beginning or end of the urine collection. The blood sample is drawn by needle from a vein in the arm. The person being tested will also usually be asked to provide their current height and weight.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
You may be instructed to fast overnight or refrain from eating cooked meat. Some studies have shown that eating cooked meat prior to testing can temporarily increase the level of creatinine.

For more on these, see Kidney Disease.
Increased creatinine clearance rates may occasionally be seen during pregnancy, exercise, and with diets high in meat, although this test is not typically used to monitor these conditions.



","



People with one dysfunctional and one normal kidney will usually have normal creatinine clearance rates as the functional kidney will increase its rate of filtration in compensation.
Creatinine clearance rates tend to fall later in life as the glomerular filtration rate (GFR - the rate at which the glomeruli filter the blood) declines.
Certain drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cimetidine, cisplatin, and cephalosporins, can decrease the creatinine clearance measurement. Diuretics can increase the result.

Cryoglobulins are circulating proteins, specifically immunoglobulins (i.e., IgG, IgM, IgA or light chains), that clump together (precipitate) when they are exposed to cold and dissolve when warmed. They may be present in small quantities in the blood of some healthy people but are most frequently associated with abnormal protein production and a variety of diseases and conditions. This test detects and measures the relative quantity of cryoglobulins in the blood.
Precipitated cryoglobulins can slow the flow of blood and block small blood vessels. The presence of large amounts of cryoglobulins in the blood, called cryoglobulinemia, can cause symptoms such as bruising, rashes, joint pain, weakness, and Raynaud phenomenon – pain, paleness, bluing, numbness, tingling and coldness in the fingers and toes with exposure to cold. (These symptoms can also occur in people who do not have cryoglobulinemia.) Cryoglobulins can cause tissue damage that leads to skin ulcers and, in severe cases, to gangrene. They can activate the immune system, leading to the deposit of immune complexes in tissues, and cause inflammation, bleeding, and clotting that can affect circulation in organs such as the kidneys and liver.
There are three types of cryoglobulinemia:

Type I, which consists of a monoclonal immunoglobulin – a single type of protein that is produced by an abnormal cloned cell. This type is often seen in people with myeloma or lymphoma.
Type II, which consists of a mixture of monoclonal and polyclonal immunoglobulins. This type is often seen in people with hepatitis C or other viral infections.
Type III, which consists of polyclonal immunoglobulins. This type is often seen in people with autoimmune diseases.

Initial testing does not distinguish between these three types of cryoglobulins, but the proteins involved can be determined through subsequent protein electrophoresis testing.

The cryoglobulins test is ordered whenever a person has symptoms that may be associated with cryoglobulinemia. Some of these may include:

Bruising
Rashes, purpura (purple patches)
Joint, muscle pain
Weakness, fatigue
Raynaud phenomenon, which is characterized by pain, paleness, bluing, numbness, tingling and coldness in the fingers and toes with exposure to cold.
Skin ulcers
Skin death, gangrene




","



The cryoglobulins test is negative (no cryoglobulins found) in most healthy people and is not routinely ordered for those without symptoms.
When the test is positive, it means that cryoglobulins are present and have the potential to precipitate upon exposure to cold. The symptoms experienced when this happens will vary from person to person, may be different with each exposure, and will not necessarily correlate with the quantity of cryoglobulins present.
A positive test for cryoglobulins may be seen in numerous conditions. Some examples include:

Infections such as Lyme disease, infectious mononucleosis (mono), hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS
Kidney disease
Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome
Diseases characterized by an increase in lymphocytes such as multiple myeloma, lymphoma and lymphoid leukemia
Disorders associated with inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis)

The cryoglobulins test will not indicate which type of cryoglobulins are present and is not diagnostic of a specific underlying condition.



","



Most people who have cryoglobulinemia are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), although not everyone with HCV (fewer than 3%) will develop cryoglobulinemia.



",,"



A cryoglobulins test is used to help detect the presence and relative quantity of cryoglobulins in the blood. It may be ordered along with other tests to help determine or rule out potential causes of cryoglobulinemia. The tests ordered depend on what condition or disease is suspected.
The sample is kept at or near body temperature during sample preparation. The person's serum is then refrigerated for 72 hours and examined daily (up to 7 days) for precipitates. If there are any present, then the quantity is estimated and the sample is warmed to determine whether the precipitates dissolve. If they do, then cryoglobulins are present.
If the cryoglobulin test is positive, then it will be followed with protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) testing to determine which type(s) of protein are present as cryoglobulins and which type of cryoglobulinemia the person has.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that are directed against cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP). This test detects and measures anti-CCP antibodies in the blood.
Citrulline is naturally produced in the body as part of the metabolism of the amino acid arginine. However, in joints with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this conversion may occur at a higher rate. Citrulline changes the protein structure and can trigger an immune response, producing autoantibodies against joint proteins. The CCP antibody test helps to diagnose RA and can be useful in identifying people with a more rapidly erosive form of the disease.
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, pain, stiffness, and destructive changes in the hands, feet, and other joints throughout the body. It can affect anyone at any age, but it usually develops between the ages of 40 and 60, and about 75% of those affected are women. The course of RA and its prognosis are variable. It may develop and progress slowly or rapidly. It may go into remission in some people and, in a few, it may go away. Left untreated, RA can shorten a person's lifespan and can, within a few years, leave many of those affected too disabled to work.
There are a variety of treatments available to minimize the complications of RA, but they depend on making an accurate diagnosis and on beginning treatment before the development of irreversible joint damage. Rheumatoid factor (RF) has been the primary blood test used to detect RA and distinguish it from other types of arthritis and other inflammatory processes. However, the sensitivity and specificity of RF are not ideal; it can be negative in people who have clinical signs of RA and positive in people who do not. Studies have shown that the CCP antibody test has a similar sensitivity to RF but a much higher specificity (95-98%) and is more likely to be positive with early RA.
The 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) includes CCP antibody testing, along with RF, as part of its criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. According to the ACR, CCP antibodies may be detected in about 50-60% of people with early RA, as early as 3-6 months after the beginning of symptoms. Early detection and diagnosis of RA allows healthcare providers to begin aggressive treatment of the condition, minimizing the associated complications and tissue damage.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects RA in someone who has joint inflammation with symptoms such as pain, stiffness, limited motion, and swelling in multiple joints


","



A CCP antibody test is primarily ordered along with an RF test when someone has signs and symptoms that may be due to previously undiagnosed inflammatory arthritis or has been diagnosed with undifferentiated arthritis. It may be ordered as a follow-up test to a negative RF test when clinical signs and symptoms lead a healthcare practitioner to suspect RA. RA usually affects multiple joints symmetrically. Signs and symptoms may include:

Painful, warm, swollen joints of the hands and wrists most commonly
Pain sometimes affecting elbows, neck, shoulders, hips, knees, and/or feet
Stiffness of affected joints in the morning that improves during the course of the day
Fatigue
Fever
Development of nodules under the skin, especially at the elbows
A general feeling of being unwell (malaise)




","



When people with signs and symptoms of arthritis are positive for both CCP antibody and RF, it is very likely that they have RA and it is likely that they may develop a more rapidly progressive and severe form of the disease. When people are positive for CCP antibody but not RF, or have low levels of both, and have clinical signs that suggest RA, then it is likely that they have early RA or that they will develop RA in the future.
When individuals are negative for CCP antibody but have a positive RF, then the clinical signs and symptoms are more vital in determining whether they have RA or some other inflammatory condition. When someone is negative for both CCP antibody and RF, then it is less likely that the person has RA. It must be emphasized, however, that RA is a clinical diagnosis and may be made in the absence of positive tests for autoantibodies.



","



The CCP antibody test is relatively new. It is becoming more widely used but is still less frequently ordered than the RF test.
CCP antibodies are rarely found in other autoimmune conditions, such as lupus, Graves disease and Sjogren syndrome, and may be detected in infections such as tuberculosis.



","



A cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody test may be ordered along with or following a rheumatoid factor (RF) test to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to assess the severity and probable course of the disease (prognosis).
CCP antibody testing may also be ordered to help evaluate the likely development of RA in people with undifferentiated arthritis – those whose symptoms suggest but do not yet meet the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA. According to ACR, approximately 95% of those with a positive CCP antibody will meet the criteria of RA in the future. Early detection of RA is essential for guiding treatment decisions.

cyclosporine,,"

None. Typically a trough level is monitored. A trough level is the lowest concentration reached by a drug before the next dose is administered. For example, if cyclosporine is given twice a day, a blood sample is usually drawn 12 hours after the last dose, before a new dose is given. On mornings when you are scheduled to have your cyclosporine level checked, do not take the medicine until after your blood is drawn.


","

To determine the concentration of cyclosporine in your blood in order to establish a dosing regimen, maintain therapeutic levels, and detect toxic levels


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant drug used to reduce the body's natural defenses. This test measures the amount of cyclosporine in the blood.
When people undergo an organ transplant, their immune system recognizes the graft as ""foreign"" and will begin to attack it just as it would any invasive bacteria or virus. Cyclosporine diminishes the ability of certain white blood cells in the immune system to respond to this foreign tissue. The transplanted organ then has a better chance of survival and will not be as easily rejected by the transplant recipient's immune system. Cyclosporine is used routinely in the transplantation of kidney, heart, liver, and other organs.
The immunosuppressant qualities of cyclosporine have also been found to be useful in treating symptoms of some autoimmune and other disorders. These conditions are characterized by the immune system reacting to the body's own cells or tissue. Cyclosporine helps to control the immune response in these cases, decreasing the severity of symptoms. Some examples of these conditions include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, aplastic anemia, and Crohn disease.
When the symptoms in these cases are judged to be severe, extensive, and disabling, cyclosporine may be prescribed. Usually, the symptoms have not diminished with other treatments or medications. Cyclosporine is used with caution in these cases and needs to be carefully monitored with blood tests.
Testing cyclosporine levels in the blood can help ensure that drug levels are in a range that will be therapeutic. If the level is too low, organ rejection may occur (in the case of transplantation) or symptoms may reappear (autoimmune cases). It is also important to ensure that the level is not too high and will not result in toxicity.

","

As soon as cyclosporine therapy begins, usually daily or 2-3 times a week, and periodically after that as the dose is adjusted or maintained


","



Cyclosporine testing is ordered frequently at the start of therapy, often on a daily basis when trying to establish a dosing regimen. Once an appropriate dose has been determined, the level can be tested less frequently and may eventually be tested monthly, once every two months, or at longer intervals. However, testing may be done more often when a person becomes ill or begins taking additional medications that may affect the metabolism of cyclosporine. A change in a person's metabolic status may also prompt more frequent testing.
Often in transplantation, people will begin with higher doses of cyclosporine at the start of therapy and then decrease the dose over the course of long-term therapy. In the cases of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, if a person appears to tolerate the drug well, the dose may be increased to further improve symptoms.
With each change in dose, blood levels need to be measured. In addition, the frequency of testing depends on a number of factors, including the medical reason for taking cyclosporine. In organ transplantation, the type of organ transplanted and the recipient's age and general health status will inform dosing. For example, a person with a transplanted liver may need to be monitored more often since cyclosporine is metabolized mainly by the liver and impaired function can slow clearance of cyclosporine from the blood.
When organ rejection or kidney toxicity is suspected, tests may also be ordered more often. Some signs and symptoms of cyclosporine toxicity are:

Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
High blood pressure
Tremors
Bleeding, swelling, overgrowth of gums (gingival hyperplasia)
Excess hair on the body and face (hirsutism)
High lipid levels in the blood (hyperlipidemia)
Infections
Abnormal blood test results on a complete blood count (CBC)
Low blood magnesium level
High blood potassium level
Liver damage (hepatotoxicity) that may cause jaundice, including yellow eyes, dark urine and/or pale stools
Diarrhea
Nausea




","



The therapeutic range for cyclosporine depends on the method used to measure the drug, the type of transplant, and the length of time since the transplant. Results obtained from different types of samples and different methods are not interchangeable. Healthcare practitioners will be guided by the laboratory as to the appropriate therapeutic range to apply to a specific person's test result.
If trough levels fall below the desired range, there is a risk of transplant rejection or symptom recurrence. If levels detected are above the range, there is a risk of toxic side effects.
Peak concentrations of cyclosporine in samples collected 2 hours post-dose are sometimes tested in transplant cases. High levels of cyclosporine in peak samples are correlated with reduced rejection rates, especially in the first year after transplant surgery.



","



A majority of laboratories use whole blood samples for cyclosporine testing instead of serum or plasma and will collect samples 12 hours after the last dose or just before the next dose (trough levels).
Some laboratory methods are more specific for the cyclosporine parent drug, while others measure the parent drug plus the metabolites, so their respective ranges will differ. Because cyclosporine therapeutic ranges can vary with type of assay performed by the laboratory, it is recommended that blood samples be tested by the same institution over the course of therapy. Results will be more consistent and will correlate better with the reported therapeutic range.
For conditions other than transplants, cyclosporine may be prescribed with other medications, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In transplant cases, other anti-rejection drugs may be used along with cyclosporine. These drugs will work in conjunction to treat a person's condition. In addition, cyclosporine blood levels can be affected (either increased or decreased) by other medications a person may be taking. It is important for health practitioners to be are aware of what medications and supplements their patients are taking and to be notified of changes in diet or health status that may affect cyclosporine concentrations.
Several prescription drugs can interact dangerously with cyclosporine and should not be taken at the same time. Tell your health care provider about all the medications you are taking.
Cyclosporine may cause high blood pressure and kidney damage. Tell your healthcare provider if you have or have ever had high blood pressure or kidney disease. Healthcare practitioners may order additional laboratory tests to detect high lipid levels or to monitor kidney and liver function.
Avoid grapefruit juice. It slows the body's normal breakdown of cyclosporine, allowing it to build up to potentially excessive levels in the blood, and can maintain this effect in the body for three days or more following the last glass of juice.
Magnesium clearance is enhanced by cyclosporine, possibly leading to symptoms related to low blood magnesium. A healthcare practitioner may monitor magnesium levels and treat with supplements as required. High blood potassium sometimes occurs. A healthcare practitioner may monitor potassium levels and will use caution with potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, potassium-containing drugs, and potassium-rich diets.



",,"



Tests for cyclosporine are used to measure the amount of this drug in the blood to determine whether cyclosporine concentrations have reached therapeutic levels and are not in a toxic range. Cyclosporine is a drug that diminishes the body's immune response. It is prescribed for organ transplant recipients to prevent organ rejection and for some people with autoimmune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, to alleviate symptoms.
It is important to monitor levels of the drug for several reasons:

There is not a good correlation, as with some other medications, between the dose of cyclosporine given and level of drug in the blood.
Absorption and metabolism of oral doses of cyclosporine can vary greatly between people and even in the same person depending on the time of dose and what food is eaten.
There can be variation in blood levels due to the brand or preparation of cyclosporine prescribed.
In transplant patients, it is particularly important for graft survival to ensure that cyclosporine levels are high enough immediately following surgery to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ.
In the case of rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, blood levels of cyclosporine must be high enough to give relief of symptoms.
In the case of kidney transplantation, blood levels may help to distinguish between kidney rejection and kidney damage due to high levels of cyclosporine.
Cyclosporine is associated with several toxic side effects that can be avoided if blood levels are monitored. The dose may be adjusted if the detected level is too high.

By monitoring cyclosporine blood levels, healthcare practitioners can better ensure that each individual is receiving the right amount and formulation of drug needed to treat his or her particular case, to maximize the therapeutic effects while minimizing the drug toxicity.

cystatin-c,,"

None


","

To assess your kidney function if you have known or suspected kidney disease, but only in specific settings when traditional kidney function tests are misleading


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Cystatin C is a relatively small protein that is produced throughout the body by all cells that contain a nucleus and is found in a variety of body fluids, including the blood. It is produced, filtered from the blood by the kidneys, and broken down at a constant rate. This test measures the amount of cystatin C in blood to help evaluate kidney function.
Cystatin C is filtered out of the blood by the glomeruli, clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that allow water, dissolved substances, and wastes to pass through their walls while retaining blood cells and larger proteins. What passes through the walls of the glomeruli forms a filtrate fluid. From this fluid, the kidneys reabsorb cystatin C, glucose, and other substances. The remaining fluid and wastes are carried to the bladder and excreted as urine. The reabsorbed cystatin C is then broken down and is not returned to the blood.
The rate at which the fluid is filtered is called the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A decline in kidney function leads to decreases in the GFR and to increases in cystatin C and other measures of kidney function, such as creatinine and urea in the blood. The increases in these levels occur because the kidneys are not able to properly filter the blood at a normal rate, causing their accumulation in the blood. On the other hand, improvement in kidney function is expected to lead to increases in GFR, which would cause cystatin C, creatinine, and urea to decline as a result of the kidneys being able to effectively clear them from the blood.
When the kidneys are functioning normally, concentrations of cystatin C in the blood are stable. However, as kidney function deteriorates, the concentrations begin to rise. This increase in cystatin C occurs as the GFR falls and is often detectable before there is a measurable decrease in kidney function (GFR).
Because cystatin C levels fluctuate with changes in GFR, there has been interest in the cystatin C test as one method of evaluating kidney function. Tests currently used include creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism that is measured in the blood and urine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and eGFR (an estimate of the GFR usually calculated from the blood creatinine level). Unlike creatinine, cystatin C is not significantly affected by muscle mass (hence, sex or age), race, or diet, which has led to the idea that it could be a more reliable marker of kidney function and potentially used to generate a more precise estimate of GFR.
While there are growing data and literature supporting the use of cystatin C, there is still a degree of uncertainty about when and how it should be used. However, testing is becoming increasingly more available and steps are being taken toward standardizing the calibration of cystatin C results.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have decreased kidney function, but serum creatinine measurements are not reliable; it may be ordered at regular intervals when you have known kidney dysfunction.


","



Cystatin C is gaining acceptance as studies confirm and define its usefulness, especially as an early, sensitive marker for chronic kidney disease (CKD). It may be ordered when a person has a known or suspected disease that affects or potentially affects kidney function and reduces the rate at which the kidneys filter impurities from the blood, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
It may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner is not satisfied with the results of other tests, such as a creatinine or creatinine clearance, or wants to check for early kidney dysfunction, particularly in the elderly or in sick babies, and/or wants to monitor known impairment over time.
Research is ongoing to learn more about cystatin C as an indicator of risk of end stage renal disease, heart failure, and death. Studies have also found that, in diverse populations, cystatin C may improve the estimate of GFR when combined in an equation with blood creatinine.



","



A high level of cystatin C in the blood corresponds to a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and hence to kidney dysfunction.
Since cystatin C is produced throughout the body at a constant rate and removed and broken down by the kidneys, it should remain at a steady level in the blood if the kidneys are working efficiently and the GFR is normal.
Recent studies suggest that increased levels of cystatin C may also indicate an increased risk of heart disease, heart failure, and mortality.



","



Although cystatin C is less variable and less affected by age, body mass, and diet than creatinine in some individuals, it is not a perfect test and can be affected by a number of drugs and other medical conditions.
Some studies have reported increased cystatin C levels associated with higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) or body mass index (BMI), hyperthyroidism, steroid use, malignant diseases, HIV/AIDS, rheumatic diseases, and certain metabolic conditions such as hyperhomocysteinemia (increased homocysteine). In addition, other studies suggest that cystatin C can be cleared by non-kidney pathways, such as in the gut, and that its levels tend to fluctuate among patients with kidney transplants.



",,"



A cystatin C test may be used as an alternative to creatinine and creatinine clearance to screen for and monitor kidney dysfunction in those with known or suspected kidney disease. It is most useful in special cases where creatinine measurement could be misleading.
For example, in those who have liver cirrhosis, are very obese, are malnourished, practice a vegetarian diet, have amputated limbs, or have reduced muscle mass (elderly and children), creatinine measurements may not be reliable. Since creatinine depends on muscle mass, assessment of kidney function may therefore not be accurate in these individuals with abnormally high or low body mass. Cystatin C is not affected by body mass or diet, and hence is a more reliable marker of kidney function than creatinine.
Measuring cystatin C may also be useful in the early detection of kidney disease when other test results (eGFR, creatinine or urine albumin) may still be normal or borderline and an affected person may have few, if any, symptoms. In this case, the healthcare practitioner may want to confirm if chronic kidney disease is present by measuring cystatin c.
Researchers are exploring other uses of cystatin C, such as using it alone or in combination with blood creatinine for estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). A recent study found that an equation for eGFR that includes both creatinine and cystatin C was more accurate than one that uses either of these alone and could be used to confirm chronic kidney disease (CKD) in people with an eGFR near 60, the threshold for CKD. In addition to kidney dysfunction, it has been associated with an increased risk of mortality, cardiovascular disease and heart failure in older adults. These equations are currently being validated in different patient populations prior to it being fully implemented into clinical practice.
Lastly, there is some research suggesting that cystatin C returns to a normal level more quickly than creatinine and could be used to assess kidney function and severity of illness when GFR is rapidly changing in critically ill hospitalized patients.

","



Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects mainly the lungs, pancreas, and sweat glands. It leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus and can cause recurrent respiratory infections and impaired function of the pancreas. The CF gene mutation panel detects the common mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7 to screen for or diagnose CF or to identify carriers of the disease.
Each cell in the human body (except sperm and eggs) has 46 chromosomes (23 inherited from the mother and 23 from the father). Genes on these chromosomes form the body's blueprint for producing proteins that control body functions.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in each of the two copies of the CFTR gene (one copy from each parent). Both copies (alleles) of this gene pair must be abnormal to cause CF. If only one copy is mutated, the individual is a CF carrier. Carriers do not generally have any CF symptoms, but they can pass their abnormal CF gene copy on to their children.
To date, more than 2,000 different mutations of the CFTR gene have been identified, but only a few of the mutations are common. The majority of cystic fibrosis cases in the U.S. are caused by a mutation called deltaF508 (F508).
Recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) have led to the adoption of a standard CF gene mutation panel. It includes 23 of the most common mutations (those with frequencies greater than 0.1% in the general U.S. population).
Some laboratories use expanded panels of up to 100 or more mutations designed to detect rare mutations particular to specific ethnic populations. These may provide slightly better sensitivity to detect mutations in some ethnic populations but are not recommended by ACOG for general screening. Some rare mutations are seen in only a few individuals and may not be detected with routine testing, even with an expanded panel.
In a CF gene mutation panel, the laboratory specifically examines the CFTR gene on each chromosome 7 for the 23 mutations. If the initial panel of mutations demonstrates a single mutation, additional testing for other less common mutations may be indicated if the individual is suspected of having CF.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is drawn from an infant's heel by collecting a spot of blood onto filter paper; for older children and adults, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. A scraping of the inner cheek, called a buccal swab sample, may be collected. For prenatal testing, a sample of amniotic fluid may be collected using amniocentesis or a chorionic villus sample may be collected.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

A CF gene mutation panel may be ordered:

When you or your partner are planning to become pregnant

When someone has a close relative who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis
For an infant, soon after birth
When a person has had a positive CF screening test such as a sweat chloride conductivity test or IRT test

Frequent respiratory infections, such as bronchitis or pneumonia
Wheezing, shortness of breath
Persistent diarrhea and/or foul-smelling, bulky, greasy stools
Delayed growth or poor weight gain (failure to thrive)
Vitamin deficiency, malnutrition
Infertility in men






","



CF gene mutation testing results must be interpreted in the context of the person's signs and symptoms and physical examination as well as medical and family history, ethnic background, and results of other laboratory tests.
If a CF gene mutation panel identifies two copies of gene mutations, then the person is diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. The test, however, cannot predict how severe or mild the symptoms may be. People with the exact same mutations may have very different outcomes.
If the CF gene mutation panel reveals a single copy of a mutation or is negative and the person tested has signs and symptoms of CF, then further mutation testing, a sweat chloride test, and/or other laboratory testing to evaluate organ function are warranted. The person may have a more rare form of CF that has not been identified or may have a lung or pancreatic disease or condition other than cystic fibrosis. The person may also be a carrier since some CF carriers may experience signs and symptoms related to CF.
If the CF gene mutation panel is positive for a single copy of a mutation and the person tested does not have signs and symptoms, then it is likely that the person is a CF carrier. If someone is identified as a carrier, then the siblings of this person may also want to verify their carrier status.
If the panel results are negative for mutations and the person has no signs or symptoms, then it is likely that the person does not have CF and is not a carrier. There is still a slight risk that someone who tests negative could be a carrier of a rare mutation not identified with the standard panel.



","



Early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis allows those affected to be referred to CF centers for specialized care, individualized treatment plans, and careful monitoring. Beginning treatments such as taking oral enzyme supplements and fat-soluble vitamins, learning how to clear mucus out of airways, and learning to recognize respiratory infections can improve a person's quality of life and minimize CF complications.
Healthcare practitioners may have varying approaches to screening and diagnosing CF, and gene mutation testing may involve a series of steps. Sometimes, a healthcare practitioner will choose to order a standard panel that includes 23 of the most common mutations. If results are negative and the clinical suspicion is still high that a person has CF, the healthcare practitioner may then request that an expanded panel be performed, or a negative result may automatically generate (reflex) a request for an expanded panel.
Based on the ancestry of the individual tested, some healthcare practitioners may immediately start with the expanded panel. In either scenario, a negative screening panel result may lead to a request for gene sequencing, a method that can identify rare mutations not detected by the standard or expanded panel.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) gene mutation testing may be used to screen for CF in newborns in some states (all U.S. states screen for CF and some states use this test for screening), to help diagnose CF, or to determine whether an individual is a carrier of a CF genetic mutation.
CF gene mutation testing may be used to follow up a positive initial test, such as an elevated immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) or positive sweat chloride test, to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
The CF mutation panel can be used as part of prenatal testing to determine whether prospective parents are carriers of a CF gene mutation and therefore at risk of passing the gene mutation to future children.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that carrier screening be made available to all women of reproductive age to identify couples at risk of having a child with CF. This is typically done by sequential testing:

In a sequential strategy, the mother is usually tested first. If she is not a carrier, then any child she had would, at most, be a carrier from the father's side. Using this logic, the father is not tested.
A positive result for the mother should include the recommendation of testing her partner and at-risk family members.

All individuals with positive results for diagnostic tests or partners who are both identified as carriers should receive genetic counseling. In addition, any individuals who have a family history of CF should be referred for genetic counseling.
CF gene mutation testing can also be used for prenatal diagnosis if both parents are known to be carriers. DNA from amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling procedures, although somewhat invasive, can be used to test the fetus for the mutations that have been identified in the parents.

The sample required depends on the type of testing. For CMV antibody testing, a blood sample is drawn from a vein. To detect the virus itself, in patients who are symptomatic, the sample may be blood, urine, sputum, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, duodenal fluid, other body tissues, or saliva in newborns. Some samples, such as amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or body tissue (biopsy), may require a special procedure to collect.


","



Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that usually causes no symptoms or only mild illness. CMV testing detects antibodies in the blood that the body produces in response to the infection or detects CMV directly.
In the United States, as many as 60% of people have been exposed to CMV at some point in their life. Almost 1 out of every 3 children have been exposed to CMV by age 5 and more than half of adults are exposed to CMV by age 40.
Most people are infected as children or as young adults, but many don't know it because CMV usually does not cause noticeable symptoms or only mild illness in otherwise healthy people. Individuals with mild illness may have non-specific signs and symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, tiredness, and swollen glands. In otherwise healthy adults, CMV infection may sometimes cause a flu-like illness or signs and symptoms similar to mononucleosis (mono), such as extreme fatigue, fever, chills, body aches, and/or headaches that usually resolve within a few weeks.
CMV is found in many body fluids during an active infection, including saliva, urine, blood, breast milk, semen, vaginal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid. CMV easily spreads from person to person through close contact with someone who is infected or by contact with contaminated body fluids or objects, such as diapers or toys.
Once you are infected, CMV remains in your body for the rest of your life without causing symptoms. After your initial ""primary"" infection resolves, CMV becomes dormant or latent, like other members of the herpes family. However, if your immune system is significantly weakened, the virus can become active again (reactivate) and cause illness.
CMV can cause notable health problems in these situations:

A pregnant woman who is infected for the first time (primary infection) during pregnancy can pass the infection to her developing baby across the placenta. This can cause serious physical and developmental problems in the baby. Most newborns (about 90%) who are infected appear healthy at birth but may develop hearing or vision problems, pneumonia, seizures, and/or delayed mental development a few months later. A few babies may be stillborn, while others may have symptoms at birth such as jaundice, anemia, an enlarged spleen or liver, and a small head.
CMV can cause serious illness and death in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipients, and cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. These individuals might experience the most severe symptoms and their CMV infection may remain active. CMV may reactivate in those who were previously exposed. The infection could affect the:
	
Eyes, causing inflammation of the retina, which can lead to blindness
Digestive tract, causing bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain
Lungs, causing pneumonia with a non-productive cough and shortness of breath
Brain, causing encephalitis
Spleen and liver
Organ or bone marrow transplants, causing some degree of rejection



Active CMV also further depresses the immune system, allowing other secondary infections such as fungal infections, to occur.

","



Care must be taken when interpreting the results of CMV testing. A healthcare practitioner evaluates the results in conjunction with clinical findings, including signs and symptoms. It can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between a latent, active, or reactivated CMV infection. This is due to several reasons, including:

A healthy person previously infected with CMV will continue to harbor the virus. The CMV can reactivate intermittently and small amounts of virus can appear in body fluids but not cause symptoms. 
An immune-compromised person may not have a strong antibody response to the CMV infection. The person's IgM and IgG levels may be lower than expected even though the person has an active case of CMV. 
The virus may not be present in sufficient number in the particular fluid or tissue tested to able to be detected.
Tests done in the very early stages of an acute infection could have undetectable levels of CMV antibodies.


Antibody testing
A positive CMV IgG and IgM when you have symptoms means it is likely that you have been exposed to CMV for the first time recently or a previous CMV infection has been reactivated. This can be confirmed by measuring IgG levels again 1 to 3 months later. A high level of IgG is not as important as a rising level. If there is a 4-fold increase in IgG between the first and second sample, then you have an active CMV infection (primary or reactivated).
A positive CMV IgM and negative IgG means you may have very recently been infected.
Negative or low IgG and/or IgM levels may mean that your symptoms are due to an infection other than CMV or possibly that your immune system is not responding normally (not producing an adequate amount of antibody even if CMV is present).
The following table summarizes possible antibody testing results:



CMV, IgM
CMV, IgG
Possible Interpretation


Negative
Negative


No current or prior infection; no immunity (person is susceptible to primary infection)
Symptoms due to another cause
OR immune system cannot produce adequate amount of antibody (immunocompromised)




Positive
Negative


Recent active primary infection
OR re-exposure to CMV
OR reactivation of latent CMV

*Result is NOT diagnostic of primary infection



Positive
Positive (with four fold increase in titer between first sample and another collected later (acute and convalescent samples)
Likely active primary or reactivated latent infection


Negative
Positive
Past exposure (immunity to primary infection); latent infection



Viral detection
A positive CMV DNA test may mean CMV is present and you have, or the newborn tested, has an active infection. High levels of viral DNA may indicate a more severe infection with serious symptoms. Low levels may indicate a less severe CMV infection, usually one with no symptoms or ones that are mild, or low levels may mean there is no active infection.
Negative results on DNA test may mean you do not have a CMV infection, but it does not rule it out. The virus may be present in very low numbers or may not be present in the sample tested.
When used to monitor effectiveness of treatment, decreasing levels of CMV (viral loads) mean you are responding to antiviral treatment. Levels that do not drop in response to antiviral treatment might mean the virus is resistant to the therapy.
A positive CMV culture may mean you have an active infection. This can often be determined in as little as 1 to 2 days. Cultures that are negative for the virus must be held for 3 weeks to confirm the absence of CMV because the virus may be present in very low numbers in the original sample and/or the CMV strain may be slow-growing.



","



The CMV test is one of the tests included in a TORCH testing panel. This panel of tests screens for a group of infectious diseases that can cause illness in pregnant women and may cause birth defects in their newborns. TORCH is an acronym for: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus, though it may also screen for other infections.
When blood transfusion is needed, certain patients, such as CMV-negative HIV/AIDS patients and CMV-negative heart/lung transplant candidates, should receive blood components that have tested negative for CMV antibodies (so-called CMV seronegative blood products) or products that are leucocytes reduced. (For more details, see the Transfusion Medicine article.)



",,"



Cytomegalovirus (CMV) testing is not used to test everyone for a CMV infection. It may be used help diagnose an active, reactivated, or past CMV infection in certain cases, such as:

Some pregnant women or immune-compromised people with signs and symptoms
People who may receive an organ or bone marrow transplant
Newborns with certain birth (congenital) abnormalities

A few different methods of testing may be used depending on the purpose for testing:
Antibody testing (serology)
This type of test detects antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to a CMV infection. It can be used to diagnose a current or past infection by detecting and measuring two classes of CMV antibodies:

IgM antibodies are produced by the body first in response to a CMV infection. They can be detected in the blood within a week or two after the initial exposure. IgM levels (titers) rise for a short time, then decline and usually fall below detectable levels after a few months. IgM antibody levels rise again when latent CMV is reactivated.
IgG antibodies are produced several weeks after the initial CMV infection. IgG levels rise during the active infection, then stabilize as the CMV infection resolves and the virus becomes inactive. Once exposed to CMV, you will have some measurable amount of CMV IgG antibody in your blood for the rest of your life, which provides protection from getting another primary infection (immunity).


Healthcare practitioners compare the absence or presence of IgG and IgM antibodies in the same sample or the amount of antibody present (titer) in samples collected one to three months apart (acute and convalescent samples) to distinguish between active and latent CMV.
Direct detection of CMV
Molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are used to diagnose congenital infections in newborns and may be used to detect and/or confirm active infections in others. These methods may be used to detect the genetic material (DNA) of CMV (qualitative testing) and/or measure the amount of viral DNA in a sample (quantitative, also called viral load). Molecular methods are more sensitive than culture, and positive and negative results are available in a short period of time.
Immune-compromised people with active CMV may be monitored using a variety of CMV tests. Often, healthcare practitioners monitor the amount of virus present (viral load) to determine a person's response to antiviral therapy.
Viral cultures are not routinely available but may sometimes be used to detect CMV.

","

To help rule out clotting (thrombotic) episodes and to help diagnose conditions related to thrombosis


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



D-dimer is one of the protein fragments produced when a blood clot gets dissolved in the body. It is normally undetectable or detectable at a very low level unless the body is forming and breaking down blood clots. Then, its level in the blood can significantly rise. This test detects D-dimer in the blood.
When a blood vessel or tissue is injured and begins to bleed, a process called hemostasis is initiated by the body to create a blood clot to limit and eventually stop the bleeding. This process produces threads of a protein called fibrin, which crosslink together to form a fibrin net. That net, together with platelets, helps hold the forming blood clot in place at the site of the injury until it heals.
Once the area has had time to heal and the clot is no longer needed, the body uses an enzyme called plasmin to break the clot (thrombus) into small pieces so that it can be removed. The fragments of the disintegrating fibrin in the clot are called fibrin degradation products (FDP), which consist of variously sized pieces of crosslinked fibrin. One of the final fibrin degradation products produced is D-dimer, which can be measured in a blood sample when present. The level of D-dimer in the blood can significantly rise when there is significant formation and breakdown of fibrin clots in the body.
For a person who is at low or intermediate risk for blood clotting (thrombosis) and/or thrombotic embolism, the strength of the D-dimer test is that it can be used in a hospital emergency room setting to determine the likelihood of a clot's presence. A negative D-dimer test (D-dimer level is below a predetermined cut-off threshold) indicates that it is highly unlikely that a thrombus is present. However, a positive D-dimer test cannot predict whether or not a clot is present. It indicates that further diagnostic procedures are required (e.g., ultrasound, CT angiography).
There are several factors and conditions associated with inappropriate blood clot formation. One of the most common is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which involves clot formation in veins deep within the body, most frequently in the lower legs. These clots may grow very large and block blood flow in the legs, causing swelling, pain, and tissue damage. It is possible for a piece of the clot to break off and travel to other parts of the body. This ""embolus"" can lodge in the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolus or embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolisms from DVT affect more than 300,000 people in the U.S. each year.
While clots most commonly form in the veins of the legs, they may also form in other areas as well. Measurements of D-dimer can be used to help detect clots in any of these sites. For example, clots in coronary arteries are the cause of myocardial infarction (heart attacks). Clots may form on the lining of the heart or its valves, particularly when the heart is beating irregularly (atrial fibrillation) or when the valves are damaged. Clots can also form in large arteries as a result of narrowing and damage from atherosclerosis. Pieces of such clots may break off and cause an embolus that blocks an artery in another organ, such as the brain (causing a stroke) or the kidneys.
Measurements of D-dimer may also be ordered, along with other tests, to help diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a condition in which clotting factors are activated and then used up throughout the body. This creates numerous tiny blood clots and at the same time leaves the affected person vulnerable to excessive bleeding. It is a complex, sometimes life-threatening condition that can arise from a variety of situations, including some surgical procedures, sepsis, poisonous snake bites, liver disease, and after childbirth. Steps are taken to support the affected person while the underlying condition resolves. The D-dimer level will typically be very elevated in DIC.

","



D-dimer testing is often ordered when someone goes to the emergency room with symptoms of a serious condition (e.g., chest pain and difficulty in breathing).
A D-dimer test may be ordered when someone has symptoms of deep vein thrombosis, such as:

Leg pain or tenderness, usually in one leg
Leg swelling, edema
Discoloration of the leg

It may be ordered when someone has symptoms of pulmonary embolism such as:

Sudden shortness of breath, labored breathing
Coughing, hemoptysis (blood present in sputum)
Lung-related chest pain
Rapid heart rate

D-dimer is especially useful when a healthcare practitioner thinks that something other than deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is causing the symptoms. It is a quick, non-invasive way to help rule out abnormal or excess clotting as the underlying cause. However, it should not be used when the probability of pulmonary embolism is high based on clinical assessment.
When a person has symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), such as bleeding gums, nausea, vomiting, severe muscle and abdominal pain, seizures, and decreased urine output, a D-dimer test may be ordered, along with a PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count, to help diagnose the condition. D-dimer may also be ordered at intervals when someone is undergoing treatment for DIC to help monitor its progress.



","



A normal or ""negative"" D-dimer result (D-dimer level is below a predetermined cut-off threshold) means that it is most likely that the person tested does not have an acute condition or disease causing abnormal clot formation and breakdown. Most health practitioners agree that a negative D-dimer is most valid and useful when the test is done for people who are considered to be at low to moderate risk for thrombosis. The test is used to help rule out clotting as the cause of symptoms.
A positive D-dimer result may indicate the presence of an abnormally high level of fibrin degradation products. It indicates that there may be significant blood clot (thrombus) formation and breakdown in the body, but it does not tell the location or cause. For example, it may be due to a venous thromboembolism (VTE) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Typically, the D-dimer level is very elevated in DIC.
However, an elevated D-dimer does not always indicate the presence of a clot because a number of other factors can cause an increased level. Elevated levels may be seen in conditions in which fibrin is formed and then broken down, such as recent surgery, trauma, infection, heart attack, and some cancers or conditions in which fibrin is not cleared normally, such as liver disease. Therefore, D-dimer is typically not used to rule out VTE in hospitalized patients (inpatient setting).
Fibrin is also formed and broken down during pregnancy, so that may result in an elevated D-dimer level. However, if DIC is suspected in a woman who is pregnant or is in the immediate postpartum period, then the D-dimer test may be used, along with a PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and platelet count to help diagnose her condition. If the woman has DIC, her D-dimer level will be very elevated.
D-dimer is recommended as an adjunct test. Since D-dimer is a sensitive test but has a poor specificity, it should only be used to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), not to confirm a diagnosis. It should not be used for pulmonary embolism when the clinical probability of that condition is high. Both increased and normal D-dimer levels may require follow-up and can lead to further diagnostic testing. People with positive D-dimer tests and those with moderate to high risk for DVT require further study with diagnostic imaging (e.g., CT angiography).
When used to monitor DIC treatment, decreasing levels indicate that treatment is effective while increasing levels may indicate that treatment is not working.



","



D-dimer concentrations rise in the elderly, and false positives may be seen with high levels of rheumatoid factor, a protein seen in people with rheumatoid arthritis. D-dimer testing is not well studied in children.
There are several different methods of testing for D-dimer. The currently available D-dimer tests that yield quantitative results are typically done in a hospital lab. Since different tests are used in different units, the results of one cannot be extrapolated to another.



","



D-dimer tests are used to help rule out the presence of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombus). Some of the conditions that the D-dimer test is used to help rule out include:

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
Pulmonary embolism (PE)
Stroke

This test may be used to determine if further testing is necessary to help diagnose diseases and conditions that cause hypercoagulability, a tendency to clot inappropriately.
A D-dimer level may be used to help diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and to monitor the effectiveness of DIC treatment.

To diagnose dengue fever, particularly if you are experiencing fever after travel to a tropical or subtropical destination


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Dengue fever is a viral infection transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that live in tropical and subtropical climates and carry the virus. Blood testing detects the dengue virus or antibodies produced in response to dengue infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), dengue infections have been reported in more than 100 countries from parts of Africa, the Americas, the Caribbean, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific. It is a fast emerging infectious disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), with an increasing number of cases and countries affected throughout the world. The actual number is not known because about 75% of cases are asymptomatic, but a recent estimate put the number of annual dengue infections as high as 390 million. Approximately 50 to 100 million symptomatic cases occur annually worldwide.
In the U.S., the majority of dengue cases occur in travelers returning from areas where dengue is endemic. Most dengue cases in U.S. citizens occur in people who live in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Samoa and Guam. Outbreaks where a large number of cases occur in a defined area are rare in the U.S. In recent years, there have been small outbreaks in Texas and Hawaii and a few cases diagnosed in southern Florida.
Many individuals will develop no symptoms at all, or have only a mild illness when exposed to one of the four serotypes (1-4) of the dengue virus. For those who do develop symptoms, prognosis is still very good for full recovery within a few weeks. The most common initial symptoms are a sudden high fever (104°F or 40°C) and flu-like symptoms that appear roughly 4 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito (this is called the incubation period and can range from 3 to 14 days). Additional signs and symptoms may include severe headache, especially behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and swollen glands.
Some people who develop a fever will recover on their own with no lasting ill effects while others may progress to severe dengue fever (sometimes called Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever). If the disease progresses to this form, a new wave of symptoms will appear 3 to 7 days after initial symptoms and as the fever recedes. These may include nose bleeds, vomiting blood, passing blood in the stool, difficulty breathing and cold clammy skin, especially in the extremities. During the second phase, the virus may attack blood vessels (the vascular system), causing capillaries to leak fluid into the space around the lungs (pleural effusion) or into the abdominal cavity (ascites).
The loss of blood and fluid during the second phase, if untreated, can worsen and can be fatal. In order to avoid that complication (sometimes called Dengue Shock Syndrome), a healthcare practitioner may hospitalize a patient with severe dengue fever so that falling blood pressure and dehydration caused by the loss of blood and fluids can be managed while the disease runs its course – generally a period of one to two weeks. During the following week of recovery, a person may develop a second rash that lasts a week or more.
Dengue fever is usually diagnosed via some combination of blood tests because the body's immune response to the virus is dynamic and complex. Laboratory tests may include:

Molecular tests for dengue virus (PCR)—detect the presence of the virus itself; these tests can diagnose dengue fever up to 7 days after the onset of symptoms and can be used to determine which of the 4 different serotypes of dengue virus is causing the infection.
Antibody tests, IgM and IgG—detect antibodies produced by the immune system when a person has been exposed to the virus; these tests are most effective when performed at least 4 days after exposure.
Complete blood count (CBC)—to look for low platelet count typical of the later stages of the illness and to detect the decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell (RBC) count (evidence of anemia) that would occur with blood loss associated with severe dengue fever
Basic metabolic panel (BMP) – to monitor kidney function and look for evidence of dehydration that can occur with severe illness

How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is collected by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?

When you develop a high fever within 2 weeks of travel to an area where dengue fever is endemic or an outbreak is occurring


","



Testing may be ordered when individuals have signs and symptoms associated with dengue following travel to tropical locations where the dengue virus is present. Some of the main signs and symptoms include:

Sudden high fever (104°F or 40°C)
Severe headache or pain behind the eyes
Joint, muscle and/or bone pain
Gum and nose bleeds
Easy bruising
Low white blood cell count
	 

Molecular testing is ordered within one week of the onset of symptoms to detect an acute infection, while antibody testing may be ordered more than 4 days after symptoms appear. If antibody testing is performed, an additional blood sample may be collected after two weeks of symptoms to determine if the antibody level is rising.



","



Molecular testing—a PCR test that detects the presence of the virus itself is generally considered the most reliable means of diagnosis. A positive result from a PCR is considered conclusive. A negative result on a PCR test may indicate that no infection is present or that the level of virus is too low to detect, as may happen if the test was performed after the 7-day window during which the virus is present in the sample collected for this test. A negative PCR result is followed by antibody testing (below).
Antibody testing—antibody tests may be reported as positive or negative, or may be reported as an antibody titer with an interpretation of which type(s) of antibody (IgG or IgM) is present.
Positive IgM and IgG tests for dengue antibodies detected in an initial blood sample mean that it is likely that the person became infected with dengue virus within recent weeks. IgM antibody tests can be positive if a person has been infected with a similar virus, such as chikungunya (called cross-reaction). If an initial IgM antibody test is positive, a second test called the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) is used to confirm the presence of antibodies to dengue virus and to help rule out other viral infections.
If the IgG is positive but the IgM is low or negative, then it is likely that the person had an infection sometime in the past. If the dengue IgG antibody titer increases four-fold or greater (e.g., titer of 1:4 to a titer of 1:64) between an initial sample and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later, then it is likely that a person has had a recent infection.
Negative tests for IgM and/or IgG antibodies may mean that the individual tested does not have a dengue infection and symptoms are due to another cause, or that the level of antibody may be too low to measure. The person may still have a dengue infection – it may just be that it is too soon after initial exposure to the virus to produce a detectable level of antibody.
The following table summarizes results that may be seen with antibody testing:



IgM Result
IgG Result
Possible Interpretation


Positive
Negative
Current infection


Positive
Positive
Current infection


Low or negative or not tested
Four-fold increase in samples taken 2-4 weeks apart
Recent infection


Low or negative

Negative

","



Physical symptoms like rash or aching joints are not a reliable means for diagnosing dengue fever because the symptoms are not likely to appear until after the initial fever has passed.
Antibody tests for dengue fever can be positive if a person is infected with another arbovirus such as West Nile virus. A healthcare practitioner will consider a person's test results, medical history, and recent travel history in making a diagnosis.
No laboratory test can predict whether or not the infection will progress to the more severe form, but those who have been previously infected with dengue are at an increased risk for developing severe dengue during the second infection.



",,"



Dengue fever testing is used to determine whether a person with signs and symptoms and recent potential exposure has been infected with the dengue virus. The infection is difficult to diagnose without laboratory tests because symptoms may initially resemble those of other diseases, such as chikungunya infection. Two primary types of testing are available:

Molecular testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR)—this type of test detects the genetic material of the dengue virus in blood within the first week after symptoms appear (fever) and can be used to determine which of the 4 serotypes is causing the infection. One type of Real Time RT-PCR test can detect dengue and the two other mosquito-borne viruses, Zika and chikungunya, and distinguish between the three. Only certain public health laboratories are able to provide the test after verifying that they can successfully perform the assay. Though the test is not available in hospitals or clinics, healthcare practitioners are able to order it through their state and local public health departments. Results can take from four days to two weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

	Molecular tests of blood are not likely to detect the virus after 7 days of illness. If the result of a PCR test is negative, an antibody test can be used to help establish a diagnosis, according to the CDC (see below).

Antibody tests—these tests are primarily used to help diagnose a current or recent infection. They detect two different classes of antibodies produced by the body in response to a dengue fever infection, IgG and IgM. Diagnosis may require a combination of these tests because the body's immune system produces varying levels of antibodies over the course of the illness.
	IgM antibodies are produced first and tests for these are most effective when performed at least 7-10 days after exposure. Levels in the blood rise for a few weeks, then gradually decrease. After a few months, IgM antibodies fall below detectable levels.
IgG antibodies are produced more slowly in response to an infection. Typically, the level rises with an acute infection, stabilizes, and then persists long-term. Individuals who have been exposed to the virus prior to the current infection maintain a level of IgG antibodies in the blood that can affect the interpretation of diagnostic results.

","

","



Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is an abnormal form of prothrombin, a clotting factor produced by the liver. This test measures the amount of DCP in the blood to help evaluate whether treatment for one type of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is effective.
DCP can be produced by liver tumors, and levels are frequently elevated in conjunction with related tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and AFP-L3% when a person has HCC or has an increased risk of HCC recurrence. This makes the test potentially useful as a tumor marker.
According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer, accounting for 3 of 4 cancers that originate in the liver. ACS estimates that over 40,000 new liver cancers are diagnosed in the U.S. each year and about 29,000 people will die of the disease. The incidence in the U.S. has more than tripled since 1980. Liver cancer is much more common in other parts of the world, with more than 700,000 people diagnosed each year.
Most cases of HCC develop in people who have chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. In the U.S., the most common risk factor for HCC is a chronic hepatitis C infection; worldwide it is chronic hepatitis B. When it occurs, HCC may emerge several decades after the initial infection. HCC affects more men than women, with the average age of diagnosis at 62 years. Symptoms of HCC, such as a liver mass, abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, ascites, jaundice, and a worsening of symptoms in those with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, are often not present until the later stages of the disease. For this reason, HCC is rarely detected early unless screening is done in those who are at high risk.
It was hoped that DCP testing would prove useful as a screening and surveillance tool to help with early HCC detection in those with chronic liver disease, but studies have shown mixed results and a recent guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends that it not be used for this purpose.

Periodically when you have been treated for HCC


","



The DCP test is not routinely ordered. However, it may initially be ordered when an individual is diagnosed with HCC. If the initial level is elevated, it may then be ordered periodically during and after treatment of HCC to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and ordered periodically along with an AFP and/or AFP-L3% to monitor for cancer recurrence.



","



When the DCP level is increased in a person diagnosed with HCC, it means that the cancer is producing this substance and the test can be used as a tumor marker. Since the test is typically ordered periodically, changes over time can be evaluated. Decreasing concentrations in someone who is being treated for HCC suggest response to treatment. Levels that stay the same or increase after treatment indicate that the treatment has not been effective. Increasing levels after treatment has been completed suggest recurrence of HCC.
A person can have HCC without having elevated DCP. The tumor may not produce DCP or it may be small enough that it is not producing significant amounts.



","



Increases in DCP and/or AFP are not diagnostic of HCC. For a diagnosis, the tumor may be located through the use of imaging scans. Sometimes a biopsy may be performed and cells from it examined under a microscope to aid in establishing a diagnosis.
DCP can also be elevated because of acute hepatitis. In persons with chronic hepatitis, mild increases in DCP are common, although not as commonly as with AFP, and generally not to as high levels.
If someone is taking the anticoagulant warfarin to lower the risk of blood clots, DCP will be markedly increased, since this drug works by blocking the action of vitamin K and leads to production of the same abnormal form of prothrombin as occurs in HCC. DCP can also be increased with vitamin K deficiency.
A person with a persistent vitamin K deficiency or jaundice due to a liver obstruction may have elevated DCP levels that are not due to HCC. Some broad-spectrum antibiotics can affect DCP test results.



",,"



A des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) test may be used along with other tumor markers such as an alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or an AFP-L3% to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. It may also be used to monitor for recurrence of HCC after successful treatment.
Not every HCC will produce DCP. If DCP is initially elevated in person who has been diagnosed with HCC, then it can be used as a monitoring tool. The DCP test is not considered a replacement for the AFP or AFP-L3% tests, but gives the healthcare practitioner additional information. These tests generally reflect tumor burden – the amount of cancer present.
In Japan, DCP is being used, along with AFP and/or AFP-L3% to periodically screen those considered to be at high risk of progressing from chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis to HCC. Guidelines in the U.S. and Europe, however, have not endorsed the use of AFP or DCP as screening tools. However, some healthcare practitioners may this test to aid in the risk assessment of patients with chronic liver disease for progression to HCC in conjunction with other laboratory findings and imaging studies.
DCP is not sensitive or specific enough to be used to screen the general population for risk of developing HCC cancer.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is a male sex hormone (androgen) that is present in both men and women. This test measures the level of DHEAS in the blood.
DHEAS:

Plays a role in developing male secondary sexual characteristics at puberty
Can be converted by the body into more potent androgens, such as testosterone and androstenedione
Can be converted into the female hormone estrogen

DHEAS is produced almost exclusively by the adrenal glands, with smaller amounts being produced by a woman's ovaries and a man's testicles.
A DHEAS test is useful in determining whether the adrenal glands are working properly. Adrenal tumors (cancerous and non-cancerous) and enlargement of an adrenal gland (hyperplasia) can lead to an increased level of DHEAS. Rarely, an ovarian tumor may produce DHEAS.
Excess DHEAS:

May not be noticed in adult men
Can cause early (precocious) puberty in young boys
Can lead to absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) and the development of masculine physical characteristics (virilization) in girls and women, such as excess body and facial hair (hirsutism)
Can cause a female baby to be born with genitals that are not distinctly male or female in appearance (ambiguous external genitalia)

When a girl or woman has excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), acne, absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), or when a woman is unable to get pregnant (infertility); when a boy shows signs of very early (precocious) puberty such as deeper voice, pubic hair, or muscle development


","



DHEAS levels are not routinely measured. A DHEAS test may be ordered, along with other hormone tests, when an excess (or, more rarely, a deficiency) in male hormones (androgens) is suspected and/or when your healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate your adrenal gland function.
It may be measured when a woman has signs and symptoms such as no menstrual periods and infertility, and when a girl or woman has symptoms related to developing masculine physical characteristics. These can vary in severity and may include:

A deeper voice
Excess facial or body hair (hirsutism)
Loss of hair from the top of the head (male pattern baldness)
Muscularity
Acne
Enlargement of the Adam's apple
Decreased breast size

It may also be ordered when a girl has genitals that are not distinctly male or female in appearance (ambiguous genitalia).
DHEAS may also be measured when young boys show signs of early (precocious) puberty, the development of a deeper voice, pubic hair, muscularity, and an enlarged penis well before the age of normal puberty.



","



A normal DHEAS level, in addition to other normal male hormone levels, likely indicates that your adrenal glands are functioning normally. Rarely, DHEAS may be normal when an adrenal tumor or cancer is present but is not producing excess hormones.
A high DHEAS blood level may indicate that excess DHEAS production is causing or contributing to your symptoms. However, an increased level of DHEAS is not diagnostic of a specific condition. It usually indicates the need for further testing to pinpoint the cause of the hormone imbalance. An elevated DHEAS may indicate:

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
A tumor of the adrenal gland, which may be benign or cancerous
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)—about 25% to 50% of women with POCS have elevated DHEAS
Rarely, an ovarian tumor that produces DHEAS

A low level of DHEAS may be due to:

Adrenal insufficiency or Addison disease
Adrenal dysfunction
Hypopituitarism, a condition that causes low levels of the pituitary hormones that regulate the production of adrenal hormones




","



DHEAS levels are normally high in both male and female newborns. They drop sharply shortly after birth, then rise again during puberty. DHEAS concentrations peak after puberty, and then, like other male and female hormones, the levels tend to decline with age.
People taking DHEA supplements will have elevated blood levels of DHEAS. Certain antidiabetic drugs (such as metformin and troglitazone), prolactin, danazol, calcium channel blockers, and nicotine may also increase DHEAS levels. Drugs/hormones that may show decreased levels include insulin, oral contraceptives, corticosteroids, dopamine, hepatic enzyme inducers (carbamazepine, imipramine, phenytoin), fish oil, and vitamin E. It is important to inform your healthcare provider when taking any of these medications or supplements.



","



The test for dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) is ordered along with tests for testosterone and several other male hormones (androgens) to:

Evaluate whether the adrenal glands are working properly
Distinguish between DHEAS-secreting conditions that are caused by the adrenal glands from those that originate in the testicles or rarely in the ovaries (ovarian tumors)
Help diagnose tumors in the outer layer (cortex) of the adrenal gland (adrenocortical tumors) and adrenal cancers
Help diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia and enlargement of the adrenal glands (hyperplasia) in adults

In women, DHEAS levels are often measured, along with other hormones such as FSH, LH, prolactin, estrogen, and testosterone, to help diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to help rule out other causes of infertility, lack of menstrual period (amenorrhea), and excess hair on the face and body (hirsutism).
DHEAS levels may be ordered with other hormones to investigate and diagnose the cause of the development of masculine physical characteristics (virilization) in young girls and early (precocious) puberty in young boys.

digoxin,['Serum Digoxin Level'],"

No special preparation is needed, but timing of sample collection is important, and you may be instructed to have your blood drawn a specific number of hours after your last dose of digoxin, typically 6-8 hours. When having your blood drawn, tell the person collecting your blood sample when you took your last dose of digoxin.


","

To determine if the concentration of digoxin in your blood is at a therapeutic level or to detect toxic levels of the drug in your blood


","

A blood sample drawn by a needle from a vein


","



Digoxin is a drug used to treat heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms. Heart failure, including congestive heart failure (CHF), causes the heart to become less effective at circulating blood. As a result, blood backs up into the legs, hands, feet, lungs and liver, causing swelling, shortness of breath, and fatigue. This test measures the amount of digoxin in the blood.
Digoxin is prescribed to relieve some symptoms of heart failure. It strengthens the contractions of the heart and helps it to pump blood more efficiently. Digoxin also helps control the heart rate and abnormal heart rhythms known as arrhythmias. It will not cure heart failure or arrhythmias, which are long-term (chronic) conditions, but can help to manage the symptoms along with diet, exercise, and other medications.
Digoxin levels must be monitored because the drug has a narrow safety range. If the level in the blood is too low, symptoms may recur. If the level is too high, toxicity may occur. Digoxin dosage may be adjusted based on levels measured.

","

After the start of digoxin therapy and at regular intervals to ensure that drug levels are within therapeutic range (not too low or too high as to be toxic)


","



A healthcare practitioner will order the test to measure digoxin at the beginning of drug therapy to ensure correct dosage. Digoxin takes approximately one to two weeks to reach a steady level in the blood and in the target organ, the heart. A test done at that time will reflect more accurately whether you are receiving the right amount of digoxin.
Once the dose is determined, routine monitoring of digoxin levels, at a frequency determined by your healthcare practitioner, will verify correct dosage.
A digoxin test may be ordered when it is suspected that levels are too low if you are taking the medication and have symptoms of heart failure, such as:

Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Swelling in the hands and feet (edema)

The test may be ordered when toxicity is suspected and you have signs and symptoms such as:

Dizziness
Blurred vision or seeing yellow or green halos
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Irregular heartbeat
Difficulty breathing
Loss of appetite

Changes in health status can affect levels of digoxin and its ability to control symptoms. Digoxin tests may be done, and the dose adjusted if necessary, when you have conditions that may affect blood levels and effectiveness of digoxin, such as kidney or thyroid problems, cancer, or stomach or intestinal illness.



","



For congestive heart failure, the therapeutic range may be between 0.5 and 0.8 nanograms/milliliter (ng/mL). Each person's response to medications is different. Many factors, including kidney function and use of other medications, may be involved. If your symptoms do not improve or if you experience side effects, then your healthcare provider may need to adjust the digoxin dose up or down according to your needs.



","



When prescribed digoxin, you should discuss with your healthcare provider and pharmacist all other prescription and over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, and herbal remedies you are taking. These can affect the level of digoxin in the blood and its effectiveness. Be sure to notify your healthcare provider about any changes in use of these products while you are taking digoxin.
Prescription drugs that can interact with digoxin include: quinidine, flecainide, verapamil, amiodarone, amiodarone, azole antifungals (such as itraconazole, ketoconazole), cyclosporine, lapatinib, macrolide antibiotics (such as clarithromycin, erythromycin), propafenone, ranolazine, rifampin, eliglustat and ciprofloxacin. Herbal remedies such as St. John's wort, oleander, and lily of the valley may affect levels of digoxin in the blood. Eating licorice may also affect blood levels of the drug.
Digoxin is primarily cleared from the body by the kidneys. If you have kidney problems, your healthcare provider may want to monitor kidney function and blood potassium levels since kidney dysfunction and low levels of potassium can result in symptoms of digoxin toxicity.
Digoxin toxicity can be aggravated by potassium and magnesium levels, so a healthcare provider may monitor electrolytes and magnesium levels.
People with a certain type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation are advised not to take digoxin as it may increase their risk of dying.
In cases where toxic levels of digoxin are found, a healthcare practitioner may administer a specialized antidote (digoxin immune FAB) to reverse the effects of the digoxin.



","



A digoxin test is used to monitor the drug level in the blood. The dose of digoxin prescribed may be adjusted depending on the level measured. Your healthcare practitioner may order one or more digoxin tests when you begin treatment to determine if the initial dosage is within therapeutic range and then order it at regular intervals to ensure that the therapeutic level is maintained. A digoxin test may also be used to determine if symptoms are due to an insufficient amount of the drug or to digoxin toxicity.

direct-antiglobulin-test,"['DAT', 'Direct Coombs Test', 'Direct Anti-human Globulin Test']","

None


","

To help diagnose the cause of red blood cells destruction (hemolytic anemia); to investigate a blood transfusion reaction; to diagnose hemolytic disease of the newborn


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) determines whether your red blood cells (RBCs) circulating in the bloodstream are covered with antibodies. The antibodies that are attached to the surface of the RBCs are responsible for their destruction.
There are a few reasons why RBCs may be attacked by antibodies:

Following a blood transfusion: If someone receives a donor's blood that does not fully match their own type, their body will make antibodies that recognize the donor's RBC as foreign. (For more on blood types, see the article on Blood Typing.) These antibodies will attack donor’s RBCs and destroy them. People who have many blood transfusions are more likely to make antibodies to RBCs because they are exposed to more foreign RBC. If someone shows symptoms of a reaction after a transfusion, a DAT will be performed to determine if those antibodies have attached to RBCs.
Mother/baby blood type incompatibility: A mother and baby may have different blood types if the baby inherits a blood type from the father. During pregnancy or labor, the mother may be exposed to the baby's RBCs. These RBCs may be recognized by the mother’s immune system as foreign and she will produce antibodies directed against the baby's RBC. A baby’s RBCs might be covered with antibodies that cross the placenta from the mother’s blood into the baby’s circulation. These antibodies will destroy the baby's circulating RBCs and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). A DAT is performed on the blood of a baby to determine if the antibodies have attached to the baby's RBCs.
	This may occur when an Rh-positive baby is born to an Rh-negative mother. This type of incompatibility usually does not affect the first baby but affects subsequent children. (For more on blood types and pregnancy, see the article on Blood Typing and RBC Antibody Screen). Formerly, antibodies to the Rh protein were the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn, but this condition is now rare due to preventive treatments given to the Rh-negative mother during and after each pregnancy. The most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn nowadays is an ABO incompatibility between a Group O mother and her baby. This type of fetal-maternal incompatibility is generally mild.

Autoimmune diseases and other conditions: Some people make antibodies that target their own RBCs (autoantibodies). These antibodies are produced because the immune system mistakenly recognizes their own RBCs as foreign. Some examples of conditions that cause this include:
	
Autoimmune disorders such as lupus
Malignant diseases such as lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
Infections such as mycoplasma pneumonia and mononucleosis


Drug-induced anemia: Certain drugs can induce antibodies against RBCs and therefore cause their destruction (hemolysis). This is seen with some antibiotics, such as penicillin, cephalosporins and piperacillin. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about any drugs you have been taking recently. If the healthcare provider suspects drug-induced autoimmune anemia, the suspect medication will be discontinued. Symptoms typically resolve promptly after the drug is discontinued.

When you have had a blood transfusion recently and are experiencing symptoms of a transfusion reaction, such as dizziness, back pain, dark urine, shortness of breath
When a newborn shows signs of hemolytic disease of the newborn
When you have symptoms of increased destruction of your red blood cells, which may include feeling tired more often than usual, shortness of breath, headaches, paleness and your healthcare practitioner wants to find out if this happens because your immune system mistakenly makes antibodies that destroy your red blood cells



","



The DAT may be ordered when you have hemolytic anemia and your healthcare provider wants to determine the cause. 
This test may be ordered when a newborn is born to an at-risk mother or exhibits signs of hemolytic disease of the newborn, in the absence of other causes of symptoms that may include:

Pale appearance
Jaundice, including elevated bilirubin
Enlarged liver or spleen
Swelling of the entire body
Difficulty breathing

A DAT will be ordered when you have had a blood transfusion and have signs and symptoms of a blood transfusion reaction, such as:

Fever, chills
Back pain
Bloody urine




","



A positive DAT means that there are antibodies attached to the RBCs. In general, the stronger the DAT reaction (the more positive the test), the greater the amount of antibody bound to the RBCs, but this does not always equate to the severity of symptoms, especially if the RBCs have already been destroyed.
The DAT detects the presence of the antibody, but it does not tell the healthcare provider the cause or exact type of antibody or if it is causing the symptoms. Your medical history and a clinical examination are needed to determine the cause of a positive DAT. 
Some examples of conditions that can cause a positive DAT include:

Transfusion reaction
Autoimmune disorder, such as lupus
Lymphoma or other malignant disease
Infection, such as mycoplasma pneumonia and mononucleosis
Medication, such as penicillin
Baby-mother blood group incompatibility

For more information about these, see the ""What is being tested?"" section.
A small percentage of the normal population will be DAT-positive and not experience hemolytic anemia.
A negative DAT means that antibodies are most likely not attached to your RBCs and the signs and symptoms are due to another cause that requires further investigation.



","



If a DAT is positive due to a transfusion reaction, an infection, or drug, it will remain positive for 48 hours to 3 months. If it is positive due to an autoimmune condition, it may be positive over a long period of time (chronically).



","



The direct antiglobulin test (DAT) is used primarily to help determine whether the cause of hemolytic anemia is due to antibodies attached to RBCs. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed more quickly than they can be replaced.
A DAT may also be used to help diagnose hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to an incompatibility between the blood types of a mother and baby.
A DAT may also be used to investigate a suspected transfusion reaction.

Some prescription and over-the-counter drugs may give a positive screening result; prior to testing, indicate any medications that you have taken and/or for which you have prescriptions.


","

To screen for drug abuse, to monitor someone with a substance abuse problem, to monitor compliance with prescribed medications, or to detect and evaluate drug intoxication or overdose


","

A random urine sample; sometimes a blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm; hair, saliva, or sweat


","



Drugs of abuse testing is the detection of one or more illegal and/or prescribed substances in the urine, blood, saliva, hair, or sweat. Testing detects substances not normally found in the body, with the exception of some hormones and steroids measured as part of sports testing.
Drug abuse testing usually involves an initial screening test followed by a second test that identifies and/or confirms the presence of a drug or drugs. Most laboratories use commercially available tests that have been developed and optimized to screen urine for the ""major drugs of abuse.""
For most drugs of abuse testing, laboratories compare results of initial screening with a predetermined cut-off. Anything below that cut-off is considered negative; anything above is considered a positive screening result. In addition, labs might perform testing for masking agents (adulterants). These may either interfere with testing or dilute a urine sample.
Among drugs of abuse, each class of drug may contain a variety of chemically similar substances. Legal substances that are chemically similar to illegal ones can produce a positive screening result. Positive screening tests are considered presumptive. Therefore, screening tests that are positive for one or more classes of drugs are frequently confirmed with a secondary test that identifies the exact substance present using a very sensitive and specific method, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Some of the most commonly screened drug classes are listed in the table below.



Drug class screened
Examples of specific drugs identified during confirmation


Amphetamines
Methamphetamine, amphetamine


Barbiturates
Phenobarbital, secobarbital, pentobarbital, butalbital, amobarbital


Benzodiazepines
Diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, alprazolam


Cannibinoids
Marijuana


Cocaine
Cocaine and/or its metabolite (benzoylecognine)


Methadone
Methadone, methadone metabolite (EDDP)


Opiates
Codeine, morphine, metabolite of heroin, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone


Phencyclidine
PCP



See a more comprehensive listing of drug classes and drugs of abuse in the table below.
Substances that are not similar to the defined classes can produce negative results even though they are present. Some drugs may be difficult to detect with the standardized assays, either because the test is not set up to detect the drug, such as methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, also known as Ecstasy or Molly), fentanyl, methadone, oxycodone (Oxycontin), meperedine, or buprenorphine, or because the drug does not remain in the body long enough to be detected, such as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB).
For sports testing of hormones and steroids, each test performed is usually specific for a single substance and may be quantitative. Athletes, especially those at the national and international levels, are tested for illegal drugs and are additionally prohibited from using a long list of substances called ""performance enhancers.""
Groups of drug tests are typically ordered for medical or legal reasons, as part of a ""drug-free workplace,"" as part of a sports testing program, or to determine compliance with prescribed (pain) medications. People who use these substances ingest, inhale, smoke, or inject them into their bodies. How much of these drugs the body absorbs and their effects depend on the substances, how they interact, their purity and strength, their quantity, timing and method of intake, and an individual's ability to metabolize and eliminate them from the body.
Some drugs can interfere with the action or metabolism of other medications, or have additive effects, as in the case of taking two drugs that both depress the central nervous system (CNS). Drugs may also have competing effects, as can happen when one drug that depresses the CNS and another that stimulates it are taken.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Urine is the most frequently tested sample in drug abuse screening. Other body samples, such as hair, saliva, sweat, and blood, also may be used but not interchangeably with urine.
Urine and saliva are collected in clean containers. A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Hair is cut close to the scalp to collect a sample. A sweat sample is typically collected by applying a patch to the skin for a specified period of time.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Certain prescription and over-the-counter drugs may give a positive screening result. Examples of false-positive screening results: Vicks nasal spray can test positive for amphetamines; poppy seeds can produce a false-positive for opiates. Prior to testing, you should declare any medications that you have taken and/or for which you have prescriptions so that your results can be interpreted correctly.

Sometimes required prior to the start of a new job or insurance policy; randomly for workplace drug testing or athletic drug testing programs; as mandated when court-ordered; as indicated when ordered by a health practitioner to monitor a known or suspected substance abuse patient; sometimes when you are pregnant, will be receiving an organ transplant, when you are prescribed pain medication, or when you have symptoms suggesting drug intoxication or overdose


","



Drug testing is performed whenever a health practitioner, employer, legal entity, or athletic organization needs to determine whether a person has illegal or banned substances in his or her body or is compliant with prescribed medications. It may be ordered prior to the start of some new jobs and insurance policies and at random to satisfy workplace, court-ordered, adherence monitoring, or athletic drug testing program requirements.
Drugs of abuse testing may also be ordered by a health practitioner to monitor a known or suspected substance abuse patient or whenever a person has signs and symptoms that suggest drug use. Depending on the drug or drugs involved, these may include, for example:

Dilated or small pupils
Drowsiness
Slow or slurred speech
Agitation
Nausea
Difficulty breathing
Delirium
Seizures
Changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm




","



A positive initial drug screening means that the person tested has a substance in his or her body that falls into one of the drug classes and is above the established cutoff level. If secondary testing confirms a positive result, it means that the person has indeed taken this drug.
In some cases, this result indicates a window of time in which the person took the substance and its approximate quantity, but in most circumstances, that information is not necessary. Interpretation of when and how much drug was consumed can be challenging because the concentration of many drugs varies, as do people's rates of metabolism.
If testing reveals no drugs, or drugs in amounts below the established cutoffs, then the results are usually reported as ""not detected"" or ""none detected.""
A negative result does not necessarily mean that the person did not take a drug at some point. The drug may be present but below the established cutoff, the drug may have been already metabolized and eliminated from the body, or the test method does not detect the particular drug present in the sample.
Tests of different body samples reveal drug use within varying windows of time. For example:

Urine testing shows drug use over the last 2 or 3 days for amphetamines, cocaine, and opiates. Marijuana and its metabolites, cannabinoids, may be detectable for several weeks. Methadone, barbiturates and benzodiazepines can be detected for about a week.
Hair samples, which test the root end of the hair, reflect drug use within the last 2 to 3 months but not in the amount of time it takes for the hair to grow, the most recent 2 to 3 weeks.
Saliva detects which drugs have been used in the last 24 hours.
Samples of sweat may be collected on an absorbent patch worn for several days to weeks and therefore can indicate drug use at any point during that extended period of time.

Different types of samples are often used for specific purposes. For instance, hair samples may be used as an alternative to urine testing for employment or accident drug testing. Sweat testing may be used as a court-ordered monitoring tool in those who have been convicted of drug use, while saliva is often used by the insurance industry to test insurance applicants for drug use. Blood is most frequently used for alcohol testing.
Interpretation of sports testing results for hormones and steroids should be done only by laboratory professionals who are familiar with particular test methods. A negative result indicates that there is a ""normal"" amount of the substance present in the body. Positive results reflect the presence of the substance above and beyond what is normally produced by the athlete's body. These results can be complicated by the fact that each person will have his or her own normal baseline concentration and will produce varying amounts of hormones and steroids, depending upon the circumstances.



","



Symptoms associated with drug abuse and drug overdose will vary from person to person, from time to time, and do not necessarily reflect drug concentrations in the body.
Ethanol may be measured in both the blood and the breath. This is the basis for the breathalyzer test used by law enforcement.
For some types of testing, such as workplace testing of federal employees, there are many regulations that cover the test from collection through interpretation and reporting of results. It is important for the ordering physician, law enforcement representative, forensic professional, government entity, insurance agent, employer, and sports organization as well as for the person being tested to understand what exactly is included in the testing, how it is done, and how the results may or may not be interpreted. This process is not nearly as simple or straightforward as collecting a sample and requesting ""drug testing.""
Prescription drug monitoring programs incorporate urine drug testing as part of the process of monitoring adherence to prescription pain medications.



","



Drugs of abuse testing is used to screen for and confirm the presence of several drugs in a person's sample, such as urine, blood or hair. Drug testing is used so that a person may receive appropriate medical treatment or be screened for or monitored for illegal drug use.
Some of the most commonly screened drugs include:

Amphetamine and methamphetamine
Barbiturates such as phenobarbital, secobarbital and pentobarbital
Benzodiazepines such as diazepam, lorazepam and oxazepam
Marijuana
Cocaine
Methadone
Opiates, such as heroin, codeine and morphine
Phencyclidine (PCP)

See a more comprehensive listing of drug classes and drugs of abuse in the table below.
Drugs of abuse testing may be used for:

Medical screening
Legal or forensic information
Employment drug testing
Sports/athletics testing
Monitoring pain medication use

Medical Screening 
Medical screening for drugs of abuse is primarily focused on determining what drugs or combinations of drugs a person may have taken so that the person can receive proper treatment. A drug's overall effect on a particular person depends on the response of the person's body to the substance, on the quantity and combination taken, and when it was taken. For instance, MDMA (also known as Ectasy or Molly) is initially a stimulant with associated psychedelic effects but later causes central nervous system (CNS) depression as it is metabolized and cleared from the body. In many cases, drugs have been combined and/or taken with ethanol (alcohol). If someone drinks ethanol during this time period, the person will have two CNS depressants in their system, a potentially dangerous combination.
A health practitioner may order drug testing for medical reasons if an individual:

Has acute health problems that may be drug-related or shows signs of intoxication, such as unconsciousness, nausea, delirium, panic, paranoia, increased temperature, chest pain, respiratory failure, seizures, and/or headaches
Has injuries from an accident that an emergency room physician suspects are due to drugs and/or alcohol
Is suspected of drug use or is known to use legal and/or illegal drugs
Is a candidate to receive an organ transplant
Is pregnant, especially if she is thought to be at risk for drug abuse or has a newborn baby exhibiting certain characteristic behaviors
Is on pain medication, to ensure that the person is taking the medication as prescribed

For a more in-depth discussion of this, see the article Emergency and Overdose Drug Testing.
Legal or Forensic Testing  
Drug testing for legal purposes primarily aims to detect illegal or banned drug use in a variety of situations. Sample collection procedures for this type of testing are strictly controlled and documented to maintain a legal ""chain-of-custody."" The donor provides a sample that is closed and secured with a tamperproof seal in his or her presence. Specific chain-of-custody paperwork then accompanies the sample throughout the testing process. Each person who handles and/or tests the sample provides their signature and the reason for the sample transfer. This creates a permanent record of each step of the process.
Examples of legal drug abuse screening include:

Court-mandated testing usually involving random monitoring of someone who has been convicted of illegal drug use or to rule out drug use by parents involved in custody cases.
Extended monitoring of a parent with a history of drug abuse, ordered by government child protective services to ensure that the person has not resumed use of substances.
Testing by law enforcement when alcohol and/or drugs are thought to be involved in an accident
Forensic toxicology testing using a variety of body fluids and tissues that may be tested during a crime investigation; the goal may be to determine whether drugs were a contributing factor to an accident or crime, such as DUI (driving under the influence) or rape. Testing may also determine whether someone died of a drug overdose or drug-related condition.
Applicants for life insurance may undergo drug screening, possibly including tests for cocaine and nicotine, even though tobacco is a legal substance.
Schools may have programs that incorporate random drug testing. Such programs may look for use of illegal drugs or performance-enhancing substances among athletes.

For additional information on this type of testing, see the article on The World of Forensic Laboratory Testing.
Employment Drug Testing 
Employment drug testing is a specific type of forensic testing (see above). It may be done prior to employment, on a random basis, following an accident, or if the employer has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is using illegal drugs. Employment drug testing is commonplace. It is required in some industries, such as those that involve the U.S. Department of Transportation, the military and federal employees, and is an accepted practice in many other industries.
As with legal or forensic drug testing, the sample collection and testing procedures for employment drug testing are often strictly controlled and documented to maintain a legal ""chain-of-custody.""
Sports/Athletics Screening 
While conventional drug testing is performed on competitive athletes, the primary focus is on doping, the use of drugs and/or supplements intended to promote muscle growth and/or to improve strength and endurance. On a local level, sports testing may be limited, but on a national and international level, it has become highly organized.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) work together to monitor athletes' drug use on a national, international, and Olympic level. WADA has a written code that establishes uniform drug testing rules and sanctions for all sports and countries and that includes a substantial list of prohibited substances. Athletes are responsible for any banned substances found in their body during testing.
Most compounds are prohibited in any quantity, while others, such as caffeine, are only prohibited when they are present in large amounts. Some of the substances, such as anabolic steroids (testosterone) and peptide hormones such as erythropoietin, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 are banned but are difficult to measure because the body also produces them naturally. Testing methods must be able to distinguish between endogenous (that produced by the athlete's body) and supplemented compounds.
Screening programs randomly perform out-of-competition drug tests on athletes during the training season to look for anabolic steroids, such as testosterone, that promote increased muscle growth. During competitions, testing is frequently done both randomly and on all winners.
Testing includes categories such as stimulants, narcotics, anabolic agents, and peptide hormones. WADA bans use of beta blockers in archery, golf, shooting, freestyle skiing, and snowboarding because they decrease blood pressure and heart rate and have a calming effect that can enhance balance and steadiness of the hands.
While professional sports organizations, such as the NFL (National Football League), NHL (National Hockey League), and NBA (National Basketball Association), are not covered by the WADA code, they have programs in place to test their athletes for panels of drugs that combine aspects of sports and employment testing. Those professional athletes who also take part in the Olympics, however, are subject to Olympic regulations.
Monitoring Pain Medication Use
Drug screening in urine is the method of choice for monitoring adherence to prescription pain medications in patients treated for chronic pain. Urine drug screening provides tools for tracking patient compliance and exposing possible drug misuse and abuse. A health practitioner may periodically order drug testing for patients treated for chronic pain for two purposes: 1) ensuring compliance by patients who are using the prescribed pain medications, and 2) monitoring the use of non-prescribed or illegal substances. Elements of a urine drug screen may include specific gravity, temperature at the time of sample collection, pH, creatinine concentration, and confirmatory testing.
Compliance monitoring of pain medications is crucial for eliminating or significantly curtailing abuse (e.g., addiction, diversion) of controlled prescription drugs and at the same time assuring the appropriate treatment for those patients who can be helped by these medications. Urine drug screening is considered one of the mainstays of adherence monitoring in conjunction with prescription monitoring programs and other screening tools.

To detect EGFR gene mutations in non-small cell lung cancer tumor cells; knowing whether a mutation is present in the cells can help determine if EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib and erlotinib may be beneficial for treating the tumor.

A sample of cancer cells from a biopsy or surgical removal of cancerous tissue; a blood sample drawn from a vein (liquid biopsy) may be used in some situations.

EGFR is a short name for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor gene. DNA from tumor cells is tested for mutations in this gene. In certain situations, DNA that has been shed from tumor cells in one's blood can also be tested and may be informative (liquid biopsy).
The EGFR gene provides instructions for a cell to make a specialized type of protein called a receptor, which is located on the surface of the cell. A receptor recognizes and binds to other substances, and the binding typically has a specific effect on the cells. EGFR is one of a group of receptors called receptor tyrosine kinases that help regulate cell growth, division, survival, and death. This regulation is a very complex process. Receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR transmit signals from the surface of the cell to pathways within the cell.
In normal cells, binding of epidermal growth factor to its receptor on the cell surface is an important signal that can promote cell growth and proliferation. Certain mutations called ""activating mutations"" in the EGFR gene can result in excessive signaling for growth and uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells.
Treatments that target EGFR are an effective therapy for certain cancers. Examples of EGFR-targeted therapy include drugs such as gefitinib and erlotinib, which are small molecules called tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that enter cancer cells and impede signaling through the EGFR pathway. These drugs have been shown to be useful in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), if the tumor has a mutation making it sensitive to the drug. If one of these sensitizing mutations is detected with an EGFR mutation test, then EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors are much more likely to be of benefit for treating the tumor.

When you have been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer; when you are being treated with an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, but the cancer progresses


","



EGFR mutation testing is ordered after an individual has been diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma.
When a patient has already been treated with an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor but does not appear to be responding favorably to the treatment, the healthcare practitioner may order additional EGFR mutation testing on a new sample, to check for specific EGFR mutations that may account for lack of a favorable response. A new sample of tumor tissue, or sometimes a blood sample, is required to determine whether the cancer has acquired new mutations that make it resistant to the current treatment.



","



If an individual's lung cancer has an sensitizing EGFR mutation, then an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) may be effective in treating the tumor. If no sensitizing mutation is detected by the EGFR test, then the tumor is less likely to respond to TKI therapy. Sometimes an EGFR mutation is detected, but it indicates that the cancer will not respond to a TKI. Pathologists and cancer specialists (oncologists) help interpret the precise significance of the exact EGFR mutation identified for each patient.



","



EGFR mutation testing is usually optimized to detect EGFR mutations that have demonstrated significance, but there may be uncommon or unique EGFR mutations present in a tumor that are not detected.
Although a mutation may be present in the tumor cells, if there is very little tumor tissue and/or when there are insufficient tumor cells present that contain the mutation, the test may result in ""no mutation detected"" despite the mutation being present in a minority of tumor cells.
Because the amount of tumor DNA in a blood sample is uncertain, testing a blood sample (also called a liquid biopsy) is generally not preferred. However, in situations where insufficient tumor cells are available for molecular testing from a tissue biopsy, or in situations where a tissue biopsy is not able to be taken, a blood test (liquid biopsy) may be an acceptable alternative testing method.
The well-known sensitizing EGFR mutations typically result in changes to small areas of EGFR protein. Testing for these types of mutations is commonly done by techniques such as real-time PCR or next-generation sequencing.



",,"



This test is helpful to direct therapy. It detects the presence of mutations in the EGFR gene in the DNA of the tumor cells to help determine whether someone with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may benefit from targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib or erlotinib. Specific EGFR mutations can lead to uncontrolled growth of cancer cells. TKIs can block the action of EGFR to inhibit cancer cell growth.
An EGFR mutation test may be ordered by itself or as part of a panel (a series of tests to detect mutations in other genes such as KRAS, ALK and ROS1). Each of these tests may be used to help determine whether a person's lung cancer will respond to targeted therapy and which type will be of more benefit.
Additionally, testing may be used after treatment is initiated to determine whether the cancer has acquired new mutations that make it resistant to the current treatment. For example, one of the known resistance mutations, specifically T790M, may be detected and can then be targeted with a different drug that has been designed especially for this particular mutation.

To detect a problem with your body's electrolyte balance


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Electrolytes are minerals that are found in body tissues and blood in the form of dissolved salts. As electrically charged particles, electrolytes help move nutrients into and wastes out of the body's cells, maintain a healthy water balance, and help stabilize the body's acid/base (pH) level.
The electrolyte panel measures the blood levels of the main electrolytes in the body:

Sodium—most of the body's sodium is found in the fluid outside of the body's cells, where it helps to regulate the amount of water in the body.
Potassium—this electrolyte is found mainly inside the body's cells. A small but vital amount of potassium is found in the plasma, the liquid portion of the blood. Potassium plays an important role in regulating muscle contraction. Monitoring potassium is important as small changes in the potassium level can affect the heart's rhythm and ability to contract.
Chloride—this electrolyte moves in and out of the cells to help maintain electrical neutrality (concentrations of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions must be equal) and its level usually mirrors that of sodium. Due to its close association with sodium, chloride also helps to regulate the distribution of water in the body.
Bicarbonate—the main job of bicarbonate (or total CO2, an estimate of bicarbonate), which is released and reabsorbed by the kidneys, is to help maintain a stable pH level (acid-base balance) and, secondarily, to help maintain electrical neutrality. Bicarbonate also plays an important role in the transport of CO2: much of the CO2 produced by the body's tissues is transported in the blood as bicarbonate to the lungs, where it is exhaled.

The foods you eat and the fluids you drink provide the sodium, potassium, and chloride your body needs. The kidneys help maintain proper levels by reabsorption or by elimination into the urine. The lungs provide oxygen and regulate CO2. The CO2 is produced by the body and is in balance with bicarbonate. The overall balance of these chemicals is an indication of the functional well-being of several basic body functions. They are important in maintaining a wide range of body functions, including heart and skeletal muscle contraction and nerve signaling.
Any disease or condition that affects the amount of fluid in the body, such as dehydration, or affects the lungs, kidneys, metabolism, or breathing has the potential to cause a fluid, electrolyte, or pH imbalance (acidosis or alkalosis). Normal pH must be maintained within a narrow range of 7.35-7.45 and electrolytes must be in balance to ensure the proper functioning of metabolic processes and the delivery of the right amount of oxygen to tissues. (For more on this, see the condition articles on Acidosis and Alkalosis and Dehydration.)
A related ""test"" is the anion gap, which is a value calculated using the results of an electrolyte panel. It reflects the difference between the positively charged ions (called cations) and the negatively charged ions (called anions). An abnormal anion gap is non-specific—it does not diagnose a specific disease or illness—but it can suggest certain kinds of metabolic or respiratory disorders or the presence of toxic substances. For more information on anion gap, see Common Questions below.
While sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate are commonly measured together as the electrolyte panel, they can also each be ordered individually for diagnosis/monitoring of conditions that affect specific electrolytes. The body also contains other electrolytes that are not part of the ""electrolyte panel"" but may also be ordered by your healthcare practitioner. These include: calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and phosphate (PO43-).

As part of routine health screening or when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have an imbalance of one of the electrolytes (usually sodium or potassium) or an acid-base imbalance


","



An electrolyte panel may be ordered as part of a routine health exam, as recommended by your healthcare practitioner. It may also be ordered as a diagnostic aid when you have signs and symptoms, such as:

Fluid accumulation (edema)
Nausea or vomiting
Weakness
Confusion
Irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmias)

It is frequently ordered as part of an evaluation when you have an acute or chronic illness and at regular intervals when you have a disease or condition or is taking a medication that can cause an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte tests are commonly ordered at regular intervals to monitor treatment of certain conditions, including high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, lung diseases, liver disease and kidney disease.



","



High or low electrolyte levels can be caused by several conditions and diseases. Generally, they are affected by how much is consumed in the diet and absorbed by the body, the amount of water in your body, and the amount eliminated by the kidneys. Electrolyte levels are also affected by some hormones such as aldosterone, which conserves sodium and promotes the elimination of potassium, and natriuretic peptides, which increase elimination of sodium by the kidneys.
Electrolyte levels can be affected by changes in the amount of water in your body. For example:

If your kidneys are not functioning properly (i.e., kidney disease), you may retain excess fluid. This results in a dilution effect on sodium and chloride so that they fall below normal levels.
On the other hand, if you experience severe fluid loss (dehydration), you may show an increase in potassium, sodium, and chloride levels.

Some conditions such as heart disease and diabetes may also affect the fluid and electrolytes balance in your body and cause abnormal levels of electrolytes. Several other conditions can cause electrolyte and pH imbalances. (See the condition article on Acidosis and Alkalosis for more information.)
Knowing which electrolytes are out of balance can help your healthcare practitioner determine the underlying cause and make decisions about treatment to restore proper balance. Left untreated, an electrolyte imbalance can lead to various problems, including dizziness, cramps, irregular heartbeat, and possibly death.
See the individual test articles for additional information on what results might mean:

Sodium
Potassium
Chloride
Bicarbonate




","



Certain drugs, such as anabolic steroids, corticosteroids, laxatives, cough medicines, and oral contraceptives, may cause increased levels of sodium. Other drugs, such as diuretics, carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants, may cause decreased levels of sodium.
Drugs that affect sodium blood levels will also cause changes in chloride. Taking substantially more than the recommended dosage of antacids can also cause low chloride levels.
Some drugs may increase bicarbonate (total CO2) levels. These include, among others, fludrocortisone, barbiturates, hydrocortisone, loop diuretics, and steroids.   Drugs that may decrease bicarbonate (total CO2) levels include methicillin, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, thiazide diuretics, and triamterene.
Some diuretics, which may be used for people with disorders such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, tend to lower potassium levels to dangerously low levels. To avoid this problem, a healthcare practitioner may prescribe a potassium-sparing diuretic.
A non-physiological cause of a high potassium level in a patient sample is leakage from the blood cells if the sample is not handled carefully or is delayed in transport to the lab. If a significant amount of potassium leaks from cells, it can contribute to a falsely high test result. When a healthcare practitioner suspects that a potassium result is not consistent with a patient's condition, the test for potassium may be repeated.



","



The electrolyte panel is used to identify an electrolyte, fluid, or pH imbalance (acidosis or alkalosis). It is frequently ordered as part of a routine health exam. It may be ordered by itself or as a component of a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP). These panels can include other tests such as BUN, creatinine, and glucose.
Electrolyte measurements may be used to help investigate conditions that cause electrolyte imbalances such as dehydration, kidney disease, lung diseases, or heart conditions. A series of electrolyte panels may also be used to monitor treatment of the condition causing the imbalance.
Since electrolyte and acid-base imbalances can be present with a wide variety of acute and chronic illnesses, the electrolyte panel is frequently used to evaluate patients who seek medical care in the emergency room as well as hospitalized patients.
The results for an electrolyte panel may also include a calculation for anion gap that can be used to help detect disorders or the presence of toxic substances (see below).
If you have an imbalance of a single electrolyte, such as sodium or potassium, your healthcare practitioner may order repeat testing of that individual electrolyte, monitoring the imbalance until it resolves. If you have an acid-base imbalance, your healthcare practitioner may also order tests for blood gases, which measure the pH and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in an arterial blood sample, to help evaluate the severity of the imbalance and monitor its response to treatment.

To detect, quantify, and occasionally monitor drugs that are causing acute overdose symptoms; results from emergency and overdose testing are used primarily for treatment purposes; if results are needed for legal proceedings, then specific legal (forensic) procedures must be followed for sample collection, storage, and testing.

","



A variety of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, illegal drugs, and household substances can cause drug overdoses. Emergency and overdose drug testing is ordered for single drugs or groups of drugs by an emergency room (ER) health practitioner to detect, evaluate, and monitor a drug overdose.
Drugs and related substances that are ingested or absorbed are typically broken down (metabolized) by the liver over a period of time and then eliminated from the body, primarily in the urine. The rate at which this happens depends on a number of factors ranging from age, weight, and sex to food intake and presence of underlying diseases. Moreover, the development of toxicity depends on the type of substance absorbed or ingested.
Some substances cause symptoms only if they are present in high concentrations or above therapeutic levels. Some common examples of these include:

Acetaminophen—an ingredient in many over-the-counter preparations; it can cause significant liver damage if recommended doses are exceeded.
Aspirin (also known as salicylates)—at higher levels, it can cause an acid-base imbalance.
Therapeutic drugs—used to treat conditions such as heart failure and epilepsy

Some substances can cause symptoms at both low and high concentrations depending on the user. Long-term users of drugs such as alcohol and illegal drugs (drugs of abuse) may be able to tolerate more drug than someone who is taking it for the first time.
Other substances are toxic at any concentration and some have toxic break-down products (metabolites). Examples include:

Toxic alcohols, including methanol and isopropanol
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze)

Ingestion of a variety of other drugs and chemicals may cause acute toxicity. This article is limited to the drugs and a few other substances more commonly tested for in the clinical laboratory. Some of the various general categories of substances that may be tested are listed below:
Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications
Overdoses caused by prescription and OTC drugs may be due to:

Ingestion of too much of a medication
Interaction of multiple drugs
A decrease in the body's ability to eliminate a drug and/or its metabolite; many drugs are processed by the liver; that is, the liver changes the drug into a different form, which is then eliminated from the body. If the liver or kidneys are not working properly, then the drug and/or its metabolite may build up in the body.

A classic example of an OTC drug with a toxic metabolite is acetaminophen, a common pain reliever that is also a component of a variety of other OTC and prescription medicines. One of the metabolites of acetaminophen is toxic to the liver, but the liver is able to detoxify ""normal"" amounts of it. However, if someone takes more acetaminophen than the liver can process, then the toxic metabolite builds up, damaging the liver and, in some cases, causing liver failure.
Illegal drugs
Overdoses of illegal drugs can also occur. The illicit drugs encountered in the ER depend on their prevalence in the community and whether these substances cause acute symptoms alone or in combination with other substances. Some drugs of abuse are ""diverted"" prescription medications, such as oxycodone or amphetamine. Some drugs, such as marijuana and other cannabinoids, can linger in the body for days to weeks but rarely cause overdose symptoms. Other substances, such as gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), can cause acute symptoms such as a loss of consciousness but are metabolized so rapidly that testing for them is rarely useful. For more on these, see the article on Drugs of Abuse Testing.
Household substances
There are a wide variety of household substances that may be abused or accidentally ingested. Those commonly involved in emergency drug testing include methanol, isopropyl alcohol, and ethylene glycol (antifreeze), which some people ingest as substitutes for ethanol, also known as grain alcohol. Other poisons, such as rodenticides, aerosol and cleaning products, insecticides, and heavy metals, can also have toxic effects. (For more information, see the web site of the American Association of Poison Control Centers.)
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Urine and saliva are collected in clean containers. A breath sample is collected by blowing through a tube, into an instrument.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a person has symptoms such as delirium, difficulty breathing, nausea, agitation, seizures, changes in heart rhythm, characteristic odors, or increased temperature that an emergency room health practitioner thinks may be drug-related; at intervals to monitor a drug overdose


","



Testing may be ordered when a person presents to the emergency room with acute overdose symptoms. Symptoms will vary depending upon what the person has taken, whether multiple drugs were involved, when the substances were ingested and how much, and may vary over time. Two people taking the same types and quantities of drug(s) may exhibit different symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include:

Changes in consciousness and behavior, ranging from confusion to agitation, paranoia, panic, hallucinations, delirium, lethargy, seizures, unconsciousness, and coma
Changes in body temperature: hyper- or hypothermia, with pale or reddened skin, dry or sweaty
Changes in breathing, signs of acid-base imbalance, difficulty breathing, and respiratory failure
Changes in heart rate and rhythm and in blood pressure, with hypertension or hypotension
Nausea and vomiting
Seizures
Slurred speech and blurred vision
Characteristic odors

When a person is known to have ingested a specific substance, that drug test will usually be ordered. If testing reveals an overdose of a therapeutic drug but the time of ingestion is unknown, then the test may be repeated several hours later to determine whether concentrations are still increasing. 
Serum osmolality and the osmolar gap may be ordered when methanol or ethylene glycol ingestion is suspected.
Supporting tests, such as electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, and liver tests, may be ordered initially and at intervals to evaluate imbalances and organ function and to verify that levels have returned to normal.



","



Results of tests must be carefully interpreted in conjunction with signs and symptoms. There are established therapeutic and potentially toxic levels for many drugs, but people may experience serious side effects or have symptoms of a drug overdose even when concentrations of drugs are at normal or therapeutic levels.
Symptoms may also be affected by other drugs that are present and by the person's age and state of health. In addition, a positive result for a particular substance does not necessarily mean that the symptoms are due to the substance detected.
Drug concentrations may correlate poorly with a person's overdose symptoms. In general, however, most people will not have symptoms when a drug is at therapeutic concentrations and many will have overdose symptoms as they approach toxic concentrations.
It should be noted that established levels and the units that are used to report them will differ slightly from source to source. It is important to evaluate concentrations in accordance with the testing laboratory's reference ranges. Examples of therapeutic and toxic levels for some drugs in adults include:



Drug
Result
Possible Interpretation


Acetaminophen
10-20 mcg/mL
Therapeutic level


 
Less than 150 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion
Low risk of liver damage


 
Greater than 200 mcg/mL 4 hours after ingestion or greater than 50 mcg/mL 12 hours after ingestion
Toxic level; associated with liver damage


Aspirin (Salicylic acid, salicylate)
10-100 mcg/mL
Therapeutic level for pain relief


 
100-300 mcg/mL
Anti-inflammatory level; may affect stomach and ability to clot; as level increases may cause headache, deafness, vertigo, and tinnitus


 
250-400 mcg/mL
Possibly toxic; may cause vomiting and hyperventilation


 
Greater than 500 mcg/mL
Considered toxic


Ethanol
Greater than 80 mg/dL (>0.08%)
Legally intoxicated in most states in individuals older than age 21 years; any level in individuals younger than age 21 years is considered toxic


 
50-250 mg/dL (0.05%-0.25%)
Increasing impairment and depression of central nervous system


 
Greater than 250 mg/dL
			(>0.25%)

Sometimes, results from emergency or overdose tests may be used for legal (forensic) purposes in addition to being used to help treat a critically ill person. If such results are to be used in a court of law, then usually sample collection, handling, and testing processes as well as reporting of results are required to follow legal procedures. These may involve some of the following:

Any samples collected, including blood and urine, are collected into containers that are sealed with a tamper-proof seal.
Anyone who handles the samples as they are collected, transported, and tested must record their involvement in a document called a ""chain-of-custody.""
Preliminary positive results may be reported quickly to facilitate treatment in emergency situations, but then may be later confirmed by a second testing method for legal cases.

Sometimes, medical conditions such as uncontrolled diabetes may produce some of the same symptoms as a drug overdose.
Most of the treatments and antidotes used for drug overdoses must be given within a few hours of the person ingesting the drug. Treatments may work either by preventing the formation of toxic metabolites, such as with acetaminophen, methanol, and ethylene glycol, or by binding to the drug, such as the treatment for a digoxin overdose.
People with drug overdoses must be monitored closely. Changes in consciousness and the ability to breathe unassisted can happen abruptly.
Other procedures may help evaluate a person with suspected overdose or poisoning symptoms. These may include an electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) to evaluate the heart's rate and rhythm or imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan.



",,"



Emergency and overdose testing may be used to screen for, measure the quantity of, and/or confirm the presence of a drug or toxic substance in someone who is:

Suspected of overdosing
Thought to be poisoned
Showing symptoms of toxicity

Drug testing may be used to help decide how to treat someone who is acutely ill. Once a diagnosis is made, testing may sometimes be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and/or monitor the level of the drug or substance in the blood or body.
Results from emergency and overdose testing are primarily used for purposes of treatment. Sometimes test results are used, however, in legal cases for establishing a cause of death or determining if impairment from drugs was a contributing factor in an accident, among other purposes. In these cases, clinical laboratories follow special legal (forensic) procedures for collecting samples, handling them, testing, and reporting of results.
A variety of different approaches may be used to evaluate someone who is suspected to have overdosed or ingested something toxic. Exactly which tests are performed will depend upon the situation and the standard practices of the emergency room (ER). Healthcare practitioners order tests according to their clinical utility, meaning choices are made based on what will be useful, available rapidly, and will help guide treatment. Decisions about tests may be influenced by the turn-around-time for results, tests' sensitivity and specificity, their ability to provide quantitative results, the availability of specific treatments, and the potential for managing the patient's symptoms effectively in the ER.
One approach to making decisions about emergency toxicology testing uses two tiers of testing. The first tier is a group of stat toxicology assays that ideally provides results within an hour and includes tests such as:

Acetaminophen—often ordered because overdoses are relatively common and can be missed. The affected person may initially have no, few, or nonspecific symptoms, even while significant liver damage is occurring. There is a therapy available for acetaminophen overdose, but it must be given within a few hours of ingestion.
Salicylates—may be ordered if a person has symptoms consistent with an overdose, an acid base imbalance, or is known to have ingested a significant quantity.
Ethyl alcohol (ethanol)—a breath test is usually performed in the field and occasionally at the point of care, such as an emergency room. An ethanol blood test is usually sent to a laboratory.
Methyl alcohol (methanol)—tests are not readily available in most laboratories. When methanol poisoning is suspected, a serum osmolality test is ordered and the osmolar gap is calculated. The osmolar gap is the increase in the number of particles in the blood beyond what is considered normal and will be increased when ethanol, methanol, or ethylene glycol are present in the blood.
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze)—also requires calculating the osmolar gap, which is also increased when ethylene glycol has been ingested.
Iron tests—generally used only when iron overdose is suspected in a child or infant.

Not every test is ordered for every patient; the ER health practitioner's choice would be guided by the person's clinical findings.
Also included with first tier testing are several prescribed and monitored medications that can cause toxicity at levels only slightly higher than those needed to treat disease. They include:

Carbamazepine, often prescribed for seizures and nerve pain
Digoxin, a heart medication
Lithium, a psychiatric drug
Phenobarbital, prescribed for seizure control or anxiety relief
Phenytoin, used to treat and prevent seizures
Theophylline, used to prevent and treat wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness caused by asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other lung diseases
Valproic acid, prescribed for seizures, bipolar disorder, and to prevent migraine headaches

Typically one of these tests would only be ordered if a person was regularly taking the drug or if someone was suspected of ingesting it.
A specific hospital might have additional tier one tests on its list, based upon the needs of its community and ER.
The tier two tests include assays for several classes of drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, barbiturates, and tricyclic antidepressants. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests have improved considerably, but results are still generally interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings.
Confirmatory testing is available but not generally ordered as it is not rapid enough to be useful for treatment decisions.
Other tests that may be ordered to evaluate the person's health status and distinguish between a drug overdose and another cause for the person's symptoms include:

Electrolytes, lactate, and blood gases to evaluate the person's acid-base balance and oxygen level
BUN and creatinine tests to look at kidney function
Liver panel to evaluate liver function
Glucose test to determine whether hyper- or hypoglycemia is present

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a virus that typically causes a mild to moderate illness. Blood tests for Epstein-Barr virus detect antibodies to EBV in the blood and help establish a diagnosis of EBV infection.
Epstein-Barr virus causes an infection that is very common. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people in the United States are infected by EBV at some point in their lives. The virus is very contagious and easily passed from person to person. It is present in the saliva of infected individuals and can be spread through close contact such as kissing and through sharing utensils or cups.
After initial exposure to EBV, there is a period of several weeks before associated symptoms may appear, called the incubation period. During the acute primary infection, the virus multiplies in number. This is followed by a decrease in viral numbers and resolution of symptoms, but the virus never completely goes away. Latent EBV remains in the person's body for the rest of that person's life and may reactivate but usually causes few problems unless the person's immune system is significantly weakened.
Most people are infected by EBV in childhood and experience few or no symptoms. However, when the initial infection occurs in adolescence, it can cause infectious mononucleosis, commonly called mono, a condition associated with fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, an enlarged spleen, and sometimes an enlarged liver. These symptoms occur in about 25% of infected teens and young adults and usually resolve within a month or two.
People with mono are typically diagnosed by their symptoms and the findings from a complete blood count (CBC) and a mono test (which tests for a heterophile antibody). About 25% of those with mono do not produce heterophile antibodies and will have a negative mono test; this is especially true with children. Tests for EBV antibodies can be used to determine whether or not the symptoms these people are experiencing are due to a current infection with the EBV virus.
EBV is the most common cause of mono. According to the CDC, examples of other causes of mono include cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C, rubella, and toxoplasmosis. Sometimes, it can be important to distinguish EBV from these other illnesses. For instance, it may be important to diagnose the cause of symptoms of a viral illness in a pregnant woman. Testing can help to distinguish a primary EBV infection, which has not been shown to affect a developing baby, from a CMV, herpes simplex virus, or toxoplasmosis infection, as these illnesses can cause complications during the pregnancy and may harm the fetus.
It can also be important to rule out EBV infection and to look for other causes of the symptoms. Those with strep throat, an infection caused by group A streptococcus, for instance, need to be identified and treated with antibiotics. A person may have strep throat instead of mono or may have both conditions at the same time.
Several tests for different types and classes of EBV antibodies are available. The antibodies are proteins produced by the body in an immune response to several different Epstein-Barr virus antigens. During a primary EBV infection, the level of each of these EBV antibodies rises and falls at various times as the infection progresses. Measurement of these antibodies in the blood can aid in diagnosis and typically provides the healthcare practitioner with information about the stage of infection and whether it is a current, recent, or past infection.



Antibody
Timing of when the antibody is typically detected in the blood


Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA)-IgM antibody
Appears first after exposure to the virus and then tends to disappear after about 4 to 6 weeks


VCA-IgG antibody
Emerges during acute infection with the highest level at 2 to 4 weeks, then drops slightly, stabilizes, and is present for life


Early Antigen (EA-D) antibody
Appears during the acute infection phase and then tends to disappear; about 20% of those infected will continue to have detectable quantities for several years after the EBV infection has resolved.


Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) antibody
Does not usually appear until the acute infection has resolved; it develops about 2 to 4 months after the initial infection and is then is present for life.

When you have symptoms of mono but a negative mono test; when a pregnant woman has flu-like symptoms; occasionally when an asymptomatic person has been exposed to someone with mono; or possibly as a means to check immune system function


","



EBV antibody tests may be ordered when someone has symptoms suggesting mono but a negative mono test and when a pregnant woman has flu-like symptoms and her healthcare provider wants to determine whether the symptoms are due to EBV or another microbe. Some signs and symptoms associated with mono include:

Extreme weakness or fatigue
Fever
Headache
Sore throat
Swollen lymph glands in the neck and/or armpits
Enlarged spleen and/or liver (sometimes)

Testing may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to establish previous exposure to EBV. Testing may occasionally be repeated when the healthcare provider wants to track antibody concentrations (titers) and/or when the first test was negative but the healthcare practitioner still suspects that the person's symptoms are due to EBV.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting results of EBV antibody testing. The signs and symptoms as well as the medical history of the person tested must be taken into account. A healthcare practitioner may consult a specialist in infectious diseases, specifically one who is experienced with EBV testing.
If someone is positive for VCA-IgM antibodies, then it is likely that the person has an EBV infection and it may be early in the course of the illness. If the individual also has symptoms associated with mono, then it is most likely that the person will be diagnosed with mono, even if the mono test was negative.
If someone has positive VCA-IgG and EA-D IgG tests, then it is highly likely that the person has a current or recent EBV infection.
If the VCA-IgM is negative but VCA-IgG and an EBNA antibody are positive, then it is likely that the person tested had a previous EBV infection.
If an individual is asymptomatic and negative for VCA-IgG, then that person has likely not been previously exposed to EBV and is vulnerable to infection.
In general, rising VCA-IgG levels tend to indicate an active EBV infection, while falling concentrations tend to indicate a recent EBV infection that is resolving. However, care must be taken with interpreting EBV antibody concentrations because the amount of antibody present does not correlate with the severity of the infection or with the length of time it will last. High levels of VCA-IgG may be present and may persist at that concentration for the rest of a person's life.

The most common complication of mono is a ruptured spleen. Other complications of EBV infection that can occur include trouble breathing due to a swollen throat and, rarely, jaundice, skin rashes, pancreatitis, seizures, and/or encephalitis. EBV is also associated with, and may play a role in, several rare forms of cancer, including Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma, as well as multiple sclerosis and fibromyalgia.
Reactivation of the virus is rarely a health concern unless the person is significantly and persistently immunocompromised, as may happen in those who have HIV/AIDS or organ transplant recipients. Primary infections in these people can be more severe, and some may experience chronic EBV-related symptoms.

Blood tests for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibodies are used to help diagnose EBV infection, the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis (mono), if a person is symptomatic but has a negative mono test. 
In pregnant women with symptoms of a viral illness, one or more EBV antibody tests may be ordered along with tests for cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplasmosis, and other infections (sometimes as part of a TORCH screen) to help distinguish between EBV and conditions that may cause similar symptoms.
These tests may be ordered for an asymptomatic person to see if that person has been previously exposed to EBV or is susceptible to a primary EBV infection. This is not routinely done, but it may be ordered when someone, such as an adolescent or an immunocompromised person, has been in close contact with a person who has mono.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend ordering several tests to help determine whether a person is susceptible to EBV or to detect a recent infection or a prior infection, or a reactivated EBV infection. These tests include:

Viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgM
VCA-IgG
D early antigen (EA-D)
Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA)

To detect the presence of inflammation caused by one or more conditions such as infections, tumors or autoimmune diseases; to help diagnose and monitor specific conditions such as temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or rheumatoid arthritis


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) is a test that indirectly measures the degree of inflammation present in the body. The test actually measures the rate of fall (sedimentation) of erythrocytes (red blood cells) in a sample of blood that has been placed into a tall, thin, vertical tube. Results are reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour.
When a sample of blood is placed in a tube, the red blood cells normally settle out relatively slowly, leaving little clear plasma. The red cells settle at a faster rate in the presence of an increased level of proteins, particularly proteins called acute phase reactants. The level of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen increases in the blood in response to inflammation.
Inflammation is part of the body's immune response. It can be acute, developing rapidly after trauma, injury or infection, for example, or can occur over an extended time (chronic) with conditions such as autoimmune diseases or cancer.
The ESR is not diagnostic; it is a non-specific test that may be elevated in a number of these different conditions. It provides general information about the presence or absence of an inflammatory condition.
There have been questions about the usefulness of the ESR in light of newer tests that have come into use that are more specific. However, ESR test is typically indicated for the diagnosis and monitoring of temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica. Extremely elevated ESR is useful in developing a rheumatic disease differential diagnosis. In addition, ESR may still be a good option in some situations, when, for example, the newer tests are not available in areas with limited resources or when monitoring the course of a disease.

When your health practitioner thinks that you might have a condition causing inflammation; when you have signs and symptoms associated with temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or rheumatoid arthritis such as headaches, neck or shoulder pain, pelvic pain, anemia, poor appetite, unexplained weight loss, and joint stiffness


","



An ESR may be ordered when a condition or disease is suspected of causing inflammation somewhere in the body. There are numerous inflammatory conditions that may be detected using this test. For example, it may be ordered when arthritis is suspected of causing inflammation and pain in the joints or when digestive symptoms are suspected to be caused by inflammatory bowel disease.
A health practitioner may order an ESR when an individual has symptoms that suggest polymyalgia rheumatica, systemic vasculitis, or temporal arteritis, such as headaches, neck or shoulder pain, pelvic pain, anemia, poor appetite, unexplained weight loss, and joint stiffness. The ESR may also be ordered at regular intervals to assist in monitoring the course of these diseases.
Before doing an extensive workup looking for disease, a health practitioner may want to repeat the ESR.



","



The result of an ESR is reported as the millimeters of clear fluid (plasma) that are present at the top portion of the tube after one hour (mm/hr).
Since ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation and is affected by other factors, the results must be used along with other clinical findings, the individual's health history, and results from other laboratory tests. If the ESR and clinical findings match, the health practitioner may be able to confirm or rule out a suspected diagnosis.
A single elevated ESR, without any symptoms of a specific disease, will usually not give enough information to make a medical decision. Furthermore, a normal result does not rule out inflammation or disease.
Moderately elevated ESR occurs with inflammation but also with anemia, infection, pregnancy, and with aging.
A very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as a severe infection, marked by an increase in globulins, polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis. A health practitioner will typically use other follow-up tests, such as blood cultures, depending on the person's symptoms. People with multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (tumors that make large amounts of immunoglobulins) typically have very high ESRs even if they don't have inflammation.
When monitoring a condition over time, rising ESRs may indicate increasing inflammation or a poor response to a therapy; normal or decreasing ESRs may indicate an appropriate response to treatment.



","



A low ESR can be seen with conditions that inhibit the normal sedimentation of red blood cells, such as a high red blood cell count (polycythemia), significantly high white blood cell count (leukocytosis), and some protein abnormalities. Some changes in red cell shape (such as sickle cells in sickle cell anemia) also lower the ESR.
Women tend to have a higher ESR, and menstruation and pregnancy can cause temporary elevations.
In a pediatric setting, the ESR test is used for the diagnosis and monitoring of children with rheumatoid arthritis or Kawasaki disease.



","



The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate) is a relatively simple, inexpensive, non-specific test that has been used for many years to help detect inflammation associated with conditions such as infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.
ESR is said to be a non-specific test because an elevated result often indicates the presence of inflammation but does not tell the health practitioner exactly where the inflammation is in the body or what is causing it. An ESR can be affected by other conditions besides inflammation. For this reason, the ESR is typically used in conjunction with other tests, such as C-reactive protein.
ESR is used to help diagnose certain specific inflammatory diseases, including temporal arteritis, systemic vasculitis and polymyalgia rheumatica. (For more on these, read the article on Vasculitis.) A significantly elevated ESR is one of the main test results used to support the diagnosis.
This test may also be used to monitor disease activity and response to therapy in both of the above diseases as well as some others, such as lupus.

To help diagnose the cause of anemia; to help diagnose a bone marrow disorder or a condition causing the production of too many red blood cells (polycythemia or erythrocytosis)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hormone produced primarily by the kidneys, with small amounts made by the liver. EPO plays a key role in the production of red blood cells (RBCs), which carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. This test measures the amount of erythropoietin in the blood.
The body uses a dynamic feedback system to help maintain sufficient oxygen levels and a relatively stable number of RBCs in the blood.

Erythropoietin is produced and released into the blood by the kidneys in response to low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia). The amount of erythropoietin released depends on how low the oxygen level is and the ability of the kidneys to produce erythropoietin.
EPO is carried to the bone marrow, where it stimulates production of red blood cells. The hormone is active for a short period of time and then eliminated from the body in the urine.
As oxygen levels in the blood rise to normal or near normal levels, the kidneys slow production of EPO.

However, if your kidneys are damaged and do not produce enough erythropoietin, then too few RBCs are produced and you can becomes anemic. Similarly, if your bone marrow is unable to respond to the stimulation from EPO, then you may become anemic. This can occur with some bone marrow disorders or with chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. (Read Anemia of Chronic Diseases to learn more.)
If you have a condition that affects the amount of oxygen you breathe in, such as a lung disease, you may produce more EPO to try to compensate for the low oxygen level. People who live at high altitudes may also have higher levels of EPO and so do chronic tobacco smokers.
If you produce too much erythropoietin, which can happen with some benign or malignant kidney tumors and with a variety of other cancers, you may produce too many RBCs (polycythemia or erythrocytosis). This can lead to an increase in the blood's thickness (viscosity) and sometimes to high blood pressure (hypertension), blood clots (thrombosis), heart attack, or stroke. Rarely, polycythemia is caused by a bone marrow disorder called polycythemia vera, not by increased erythropoietin.

When you have anemia that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be caused by decreased red blood cell production; when you are producing too many red blood cells


","



An erythropoietin (EPO) test may be ordered when you have anemia that does not appear to be caused by iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, decreased lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs; hemolysis), or by excessive bleeding. It may be ordered when the RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit are decreased and the reticulocyte count is inappropriately normal or decreased.
If you have chronic kidney disease, erythropoietin levels may be ordered when your healthcare practitioner suspects that kidney dysfunction could be associated with a decrease in erythropoietin production.
An EPO test may be ordered when a complete blood count shows that you have an increased number of RBCs and a high hematocrit and hemoglobin.
An EPO test may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a bone marrow disorder, such as a myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).



","



If you have anemia and erythropoietin levels are low or normal, then your kidneys may not be producing enough EPO.
If you have anemia and erythropoietin levels are increased, then the anemia may be due to iron or vitamin deficiency, or a bone marrow disorder.
If you have too many red blood cells (RBCs) and erythropoietin levels are increased, then it is likely that excess erythropoietin is being produced – either by your kidneys or by other tissues in your body. This condition is called secondary polycythemia.
If you have too many RBCs and erythropoietin levels are normal or low, then it is likely that the polycythemia has a cause that is independent of erythropoietin production. This condition is called primary polycythemia.

","



If anemia is due to a vitamin B12, folate, or iron deficiency, then the anemia may persist even when enough erythropoietin is produced. The red blood cells (RBCs) produced in these deficiencies may not be normal in size, shape, and/or hemoglobin content.
Pregnant women, chronic smokers, and people with lung disease, or who live at high altitudes may have increased levels of erythropoietin.



","



An erythropoietin (EPO) test is used primarily to help diagnose the cause of anemia. An EPO test is usually ordered in follow up to abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC), such as a low red blood cell (RBC) count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit. These tests help diagnose anemia and give the healthcare practitioner clues as to the likely cause of the anemia. Erythropoietin testing is used to help determine if low EPO may be causing and/or worsening the anemia.
If you have chronic kidney disease, an EPO test may be ordered to evaluate the kidneys' continued ability to produce enough erythropoietin. Testing can help determine whether you should receive erythropoietin replacement therapy. If the erythropoietin level is low, erythropoietin replacement therapy may help increase red cell production in the bone marrow.
Occasionally, an erythropoietin test may be ordered in follow up to CBC results that show an increased number of RBCs, to help diagnose the cause. Testing may help determine whether the excess production of RBCs (polycythemia or erythrocytosis) is due to an overproduction of erythropoietin or some other cause (e.g., JAK2 mutation, bone marrow disorder).

To assess kidney function and diagnose, stage, and monitor chronic kidney disease (CKD)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; the eGFR is a calculated estimate of the actual glomerular filtration rate and is based on your blood creatinine level and/or blood cystatin C level. Depending on the formula used, your age, sex, and race may also be needed.


","



Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of how well your kidneys are working. The kidney's primary function is to filter blood. Waste and excess water gets removed and turned into urine. The levels of salts and minerals in blood are adjusted to maintain a healthy balance. In addition, kidneys produce hormones that regulate blood pressure, maintain bone health, and control production of red blood cells.
Glomeruli are tiny filters in the kidneys that allow waste products to be removed from the blood, while preventing the loss of important substances, including proteins and blood cells. Every day, healthy kidneys filter about 200 quarts of blood and produce about 2 quarts of urine. The GFR refers to the amount of blood that is filtered by the glomeruli per minute. As kidney function declines due to damage or disease, the filtration rate decreases and waste products begin to build up in the blood.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disease associated with a slow and progressive decrease in kidney function. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the two main causes of CKD. Aging is another risk factor for CKD that is often overlooked. As we age, so do our kidneys, losing about 1% of kidney filtration per year after age of 40.
Kidney diseases tend to progress silently and most cases of early stages of CKD go undiagnosed. Most people have no symptoms until 30-40% of kidney function is lost. Early detection of kidney dysfunction is crucial because it can help to minimize the damage by starting a suitable treatment. Screening for CKD is recommended for high risk groups, such as people with diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease, family history of kidney failure, and the elderly (age 60 and older).
Simple laboratory tests used to evaluate kidney function include the blood creatinine test and/or blood cystatin C test to estimate GFR and urine albumin and urine creatinine clearance.
Measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) directly is considered the most accurate way to detect changes in kidney function, but measuring the GFR directly is complicated, requires experienced personnel, and is typically performed only in research settings and transplant centers. For this reason, the estimated GFR (eGFR), which represents the best routinely available measurement of kidney function, is usually used. See ""How can my actual GFR be determined?"" under Common Questions for more information.
The eGFR is calculated according to the formulae recommended by the National Kidney Foundation using measured test results of blood creatinine levels and in special circumstances blood cystatin C levels.

The most common approach is the eGFR based on blood creatinine level along with other variables such as age, sex, and race (e.g., African-American, non-African American), depending on the equation used. Creatinine is a muscle waste product that is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine at a relatively steady rate. When kidney function decreases, less creatinine is eliminated and levels increase in the blood. The variations in muscle metabolism and muscle mass can lead to significant differences in measured creatinine levels. The eGFR may not be reliable in amputees, body builders, vegetarians, patients at the extremes of weight and age, and those with rapidly changing kidney function (e.g., acute kidney injury). In addition, some medications can increase creatinine.
The eGFR calculated based on blood cystatin C level is recommended for confirmatory testing when eGFR based on serum creatinine is less accurate (e.g., elderly, overweight or people with abnormal muscle mass). Cystatin C is a small protein produced at a constant rate by all nucleated cells in the body and is found in various body fluids, including blood. It is filtered by the kidneys and broken down at a constant rate. It does not reenter the blood circulation or get eliminated in the urine. Unlike creatinine, which is affected by muscle mass, cystatin C is affected by age, inflammation, obesity, and diabetes. Cystatin C is a relatively new biomarker and extensive research is ongoing to define its optimal use. See ""Is there anything else I should know?"" under Common Questions for more information.

Different equations may be used to calculate eGFR. The following two are most common and require a blood creatinine result, age, and assigned values based upon sex and race.

Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation (2009)—recommended by the National Kidney Foundation for calculating eGFR in adults.
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD) equation—some laboratories continue to use this equation.

Additional sets of CKD-EPI equations recommended by the National Kidney Foundation for adults that use cystatin C level to calculate eGFR, along with age and gender, include:

Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) cystatin C equation (2012)
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine and cystatin C equation (2012)

The results reported using one of the above equations versus the other will not be identical but should give a healthcare practitioner similar information.
Separate equations, based on serum creatinine levels and height, are recommended for use in youth age 18 years and under. One is the updated Schwartz equation that takes the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level into consideration.
The eGFR equations are not valid for those who are 70 years of age or older because muscle mass normally decreases with age.
See ""Could I calculate my own eGFR?"" under Common Questions for more information about these eGFR equations.

A creatinine test and eGFR may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate your kidney function as part of a health checkup or if kidney disease is suspected. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include:

Swelling or puffiness, particularly around the eyes or in the face, wrists, abdomen, thighs, or ankles
Urine that is foamy, bloody, or coffee-colored
A decrease in the amount of urine
Problems urinating, such as a burning feeling or abnormal discharge during urination, or a change in the frequency of urination, especially at night
Mid-back pain (flank), below the ribs, near where the kidneys are located

Urinating more or less often
Feeling itchy
Tiredness, loss of concentration
Loss of appetite, nausea and/or vomiting
Swelling and/or numbness in hands and feet
Darkened skin
Muscle cramps

An eGFR may be repeated if the initial result is abnormal to see if it persists.
The test is usually ordered periodically when you have chronic kidney disease (CKD) or a condition such as diabetes or hypertension that is associated with an increased risk of kidney damage.



","



Estimated GFR results are reported as milliliters/minute/1.73m2 (mL/min/1.73m2). Because some laboratories do not collect information on a patient's race when the sample is collected for serum creatinine testing, they may report calculated results for both African Americans and non-African Americans. The healthcare practitioner uses the result that applies to you in order to interpret the results correctly.
A normal eGFR for adults is greater than 90 mL/min/1.73m2, according to the National Kidney Foundation. (Clinical laboratories that use the MDRD equation to calculate eGFR will only report actual values that are less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 because MDRD works best for estimating reduced kidney function. Clinical laboratories that use CKD-EPI equations often report all numerical values.)
An eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 suggests that some kidney damage has occurred. The test may be repeated to see if the abnormal result persists. Chronic kidney disease is diagnosed when you have an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for more than three months.
You may have some kidney damage even with an eGFR greater than 90 mL/min/1.73m2. Other evidence, such as increased urine albumin, may indicate some degree of kidney damage. Thus, your eGFR should be interpreted in relation to your medical history and signs and symptoms.

The actual amount of creatinine that you produce and eliminate is affected by your muscle mass and by the amount of protein in your diet. Men tend to have higher creatinine levels than women and children.
A person's GFR decreases with age and some illnesses. The GFR usually increases during pregnancy.
The eGFR may be affected by a variety of drugs, such as gentamicin, cisplatin, and cefoxitin, that increase creatinine levels, and by any condition that decreases blood flow to the kidneys.
The calculation of eGFR is intended to be used when kidney function and creatinine/cystatin C production are stable. If a creatinine or cystatin C level is measured when the kidney function is changing rapidly, such as with acute kidney injury, then it will not give a useful estimate of the filtration rate.



","



The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is used to screen for and detect early kidney damage, to help diagnose chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to monitor kidney status.
The National Kidney Disease Education Program, American Society of Nephrology, and the National Kidney Foundation all recommend that an eGFR be calculated every time a creatinine blood test is done. The creatinine test is ordered frequently as part of a routine comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or basic metabolic panel (BMP), or along with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test to evaluate the health of your kidneys.
Creatinine, along with eGFR, is often used to monitor people with known CKD and those with conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension) that may lead to kidney damage.
The eGFR calculated using cystatin C is used similarly to creatinine-based eGFR. Cystatin C is not a part of the routine testing and may not be offered by all clinical laboratories. Your healthcare professional will decide if you may benefit from this additional testing.

Receptors are specialized proteins on the surface of or within cells that bind to specific substances. The binding typically has a specific effect on the cells. Many, but not all, breast cancer cells have receptors that bind to the hormones estrogen and/or progesterone. Breast cancer tumors with estrogen receptors (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR) typically depend on the hormones to grow and divide. ER and PR testing of breast tumor tissue determines if one or both types of receptors are present. About two out of three breast cancers are positive for ER and PR.

When you have been diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or when your cancer has recurred or metastasized;
When hormone receptor test results were initially negative on a biopsy, and a subsequent specimen becomes available, repeat testing may be considered.



","



In 2010, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) jointly published guidelines that recommend that all tumors from individuals with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer be evaluated for estrogen and progesterone receptors. The guidelines also state that all recurrent breast cancers should be tested and that the option of testing should be provided for patients who have non-invasive breast cancer.
A 2015 ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline reaffirmed that retesting of metastatic tumors for ER and PR receptors should be offered, although it is unclear whether changing treatment on the basis of a change in receptor test results affects clinical outcomes.
The 2017 NCCN guideline for breast cancer also recommends ER testing for ER and PR for invasive breast cancer.



","



The results for ER receptor and PR receptor testing cover a range from low to high levels of receptor expression. Patients receive greater benefit from hormone therapy if their breast tumor has more ER receptors. Studies indicate that tumors with less receptor expression are less likely to respond to the therapies that aim to reduce stimulation of the receptors such as tamoxifen, but even low positivity may be associated with some response. The more receptors present, the more likely the response.
Guidelines recommend classifying tumors with as few as 1% positive cells as receptor positive, but for tumors with low ER expression, the decision for targeted therapy should be based on an analysis of its risks versus potential benefits. If a person's cancer is ER-negative but PR-positive, or ER-positive but PR-negative, then the person may still benefit from hormone therapy.
If the cancer is both ER-negative and PR-negative, then the person is not likely to benefit from hormone therapy.
An individual's response to hormone therapy will depend on a variety of factors, but typical approximate response rates include:

ER-positive, PR-positive: 75-80%
ER-positive, PR-negative: 40-50%
ER-negative, PR-positive: 25-30%
ER-negative, PR-negative: 10% or less
	 

If there is a discrepancy between test results after testing a primary and a metastatic tumor sample, many times the ER and PR status of the metastasis can be used to guide therapy when considered in the context of the clinical scenario and your treatment goals.



","



It takes a small amount of cancer tissue to perform hormone receptor status testing. If a sufficient sample is not available, your healthcare practitioner may make an assumption that your cancer is ER-positive and PR-positive in order to broaden the treatment options. However, for women with ER-negative invasive breast cancer, studies have demonstrated no benefit from endocrine treatments.
While uncommon, truly ER-negative but PR-positive invasive breast tumors are also considered eligible for hormone therapy. Receptor status may provide some information about prognosis.
You may obtain a copy of your ER and PR test report and review the results with your healthcare practitioner to fully understand the results.



","



Hormone receptor testing of breast tumor tissue is used to determine if estrogen receptors (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PR) are present and whether the tumor tissues depend on estrogen and/or progesterone to grow. Knowing if a tumor grows under the influence of hormones indicates whether removal of one's ovaries, which produce the hormones, or blocking the hormones with drugs (hormone therapy or endocrine therapy) can inhibit tumor growth to prolong survival. Studies have demonstrated a benefit from such hormone therapy for patients with ER-positive tumors.

Estrogens are a group of steroids that are responsible for the development and function of reproductive organs and the formation of secondary sex characteristics in women. Along with another hormone, progesterone, they help regulate the menstrual cycle, are involved in the growth of breasts and the uterus, and help maintain a healthy pregnancy. Though considered the main sex hormones for women, they are also found in men and play a role in bone metabolism and growth in both sexes. Estrogen tests measure one of three components: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), or estriol (E3) in the blood or urine.

Estrone (E1) is directly converted from androstenedione (from the adrenal gland) or indirectly from other androgens. E1 can also be produced by the ovaries and placenta, testicles, and adipose (fat) tissues. E2 and E1 can be converted into each other as needed. E1 is the primary estrogen in men and in post-menopausal women.
Estradiol (E2) is primarily produced in the ovaries under stimulation of FSH and LH in pre-menopausal women and in the testicles in men. E2 is converted from E1 in post-menopausal women. It is the most potent estrogen and the one that is present in the highest concentration in non-pregnant, pre-menopausal women. E2 levels vary depending on a woman's age and reproductive status. They are a good marker of ovarian function.
Estriol (E3) is produced by the placenta, with concentrations rising throughout a woman's pregnancy. Increasing levels are an indication of the health of the pregnancy and developing baby. Estriol is part of the second trimester maternal serum screen, a test performed to evaluate fetal risk due to certain chromosomal abnormalities. Very low levels of E3 are present in non-pregnant women or men.

Estrogen in Girls and Women
The types and amounts of estrogen normally present in a woman's blood will vary throughout her lifetime. Levels vary during each menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, and on a daily basis.
At Birth
Estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) are high but fall within a few days. Concentration levels are minimal during early childhood.
At Puberty
Concentrations of E2 and E1 begin to rise as puberty approaches. These estrogens are responsible for the development of breasts, uterine growth, and (with other hormones) the onset and regulation of menstruation. A moderate amount of E1 is present from puberty to menopause. This concentration will vary during the day but is otherwise relatively stable.
During Menstruation
The menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days long and consists of two phases, follicular phase (day 1-14) and luteal phase (day 15-28). During each cycle, estradiol (E2) and several other hormones normally rise and then fall in a specific sequence.
During Pregnancy
Estriol (E3) is the primary estrogen present during pregnancy. It is produced by the placenta, starts to rise in the eighth week of pregnancy, and continues to rise throughout the pregnancy. A sharp increase of E3 occurs approximately 4 weeks prior to the onset of labor. Estriol circulating in maternal blood is quickly cleared out of the body. Each measurement of estriol is a snapshot of what is happening with the placenta and fetus, but there is also natural daily variation in estriol concentrations.
E1 also rises during pregnancy, increasing as much as 10-fold between weeks 24 and 40. After delivery, E1 falls and E3 again becomes essentially undetectable.
During Menopause
Estrone (E1) is the primary estrogen present during menopause. E2 concentrations significantly decrease as ovarian production wanes and eventually stabilize at a low level.
Estrogen in Boys and Men
The types and amounts of estrogen normally present in a man's blood change, but they vary much less over time than a woman's and they are much lower.

In Girls and Women
Estradiol (E2) and/or estrone (E1) testing in girls and women may be ordered when:

A girl's sex organs develop earlier or later than normally expected
A woman has symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding after menopause or abnormal or lack of menstrual cycles
A woman is experiencing infertility; a series of estradiol measurements over the course of a woman's menstrual cycle may be done to monitor follicle development prior to in vitro fertilization techniques (timed with a surge in estradiol).
A woman is having symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, and/or irregular or lack of menstrual periods
A menopausal woman is taking hormone replacement therapy; her health practitioner may periodically order estrone levels to monitor treatment.

Estriol (E3) testing in women may be ordered:

During pregnancy, a healthcare practitioner may order serial estriol samples to look for a trend, whether there is a rise or fall in the estriol level over time.
Unconjugated estriol is often measured in the 15th to 20th week of gestation as part of the triple/quad screen.

In Boys and Men
Estradiol (E2) and/or estrone (E1) testing in boys and men may be ordered when:

A boy has delayed puberty, characterized by delayed development of muscle mass, lack of deepening of the voice or growth of body hair, slow or delayed growth of testicles and penis
A man shows signs of feminization, such as enlarged breasts

Normal estrogen results depend upon the sex and age of the person being tested. With women, it also depends upon their menstrual cycle or whether they are pregnant. Reference ranges will vary somewhat between laboratories, both in normal values listed and in units used.
Increased or decreased levels of estrogens are seen in many metabolic conditions. Care must be used in the interpretation of estrone, estradiol, and estriol results because the levels vary on a day-to-day basis and throughout a woman's menstrual cycle.
A healthcare practitioner who is monitoring a woman's hormones will be looking at trends in the levels, rising or lowering over time in conjunction with the menstrual cycle or pregnancy rather than evaluating single values. Test results are not diagnostic of a specific condition but give the healthcare practitioner information about the potential cause of a person's symptoms or status.
Below are conditions with which one might see an increase or decrease of estrogen levels.
Increased levels of estradiol (E2) or estrone (E1) are seen in:
Girls and Women:

Early (precocious) puberty
Tumors of the ovary or adrenal glands

Boys and Men:

Enlarged breasts (gynecomastia)
Tumors of the testicles (testicular cancer) or adrenal glands
Delayed puberty

Both Women and Men:

Hyperthyroidism
Cirrhosis

In women, decreased levels of estrogen are seen in:

Turner syndrome, an inherited condition in women caused by a missing or abnormal X chromosome and characterized by underdeveloped female sex characteristics
Low level of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism)
Dysfunction of the ovaries (female hypogonadism)
Failing pregnancy (estriol)
Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa
After menopause (estradiol)
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, also called Stein-Levanthal syndrome)
Extreme endurance exercise




","



Blood and urine results are not interchangeable. Your healthcare practitioner will choose which estrogen and sample type to test. In addition to blood and urine, estrogen testing is occasionally also performed on saliva or on amniotic fluid.
Beyond daily and cycle variations, illnesses such as high blood pressure (hypertension), anemia, and impaired liver and kidney function can affect estrogen levels.



",,"



Estrogen tests are used to detect a deficiency or excess in a woman and to help diagnose a variety of conditions associated with this imbalance. They may also be used to help determine the timing of a woman's ovulation and may be ordered to monitor the health status of the developing baby and placenta during pregnancy. In a man, estrogen testing may be performed to detect a hormone excess and its cause.
Estrogen tests measure one of three components: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), or estriol (E3). These tests each have different uses.
In Girls and Women
Estradiol (E2) and/or estrone (E1) testing may be ordered to:

Help diagnose early-onset puberty, when a young girl develops secondary sex characteristics sooner than expected; or delayed puberty, when a girl shows delayed development of secondary sex characteristics or start of menstruation
Investigate menstrual abnormalities, such as lack of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), infertility, and abnormal vaginal bleeding
Evaluate the function of the ovaries and detect ovarian failure
Monitor follicle development in the ovary in the days prior to in vitro fertilization by making serial measurements of estradiol
Monitor hormone replacement therapy that is given to assist fertility
Monitor menopausal hormone replacement therapy that is given to alleviate symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency
Detect estrogen-producing tumors
Monitor anti-estrogen therapy, as in breast cancer

Estriol (E3) testing:

May sometimes be ordered serially to help monitor a high-risk pregnancy; when it is used this way, each sample should be drawn at the same time each day.
An unconjugated estriol test is one of the components of second trimester maternal serum screening. Decreased levels have been associated with various genetic disorders, including Down syndrome, neural tube defects, and adrenal abnormalities.

In Boys and Men
Estradiol (E2) and/or estrone (E1) testing in boys or men may be ordered to:

Help diagnose delayed puberty
Help diagnose the cause of enlarged breasts (gynecomastia) or other signs of feminization
Detect a relative estrogen excess that is due to a testosterone or androgen deficiency
Detect estrogen-producing tumors

","

To determine if a person has consumed ethanol and to measure the level of ethanol in order to detect and evaluate impairment, intoxication, or overdose


","

A breath sample is collected by blowing into a tube or balloon. A breath sample is analyzed immediately on site using a breath-analyzer. A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Urine samples are collected in sterile, plastic containers. Sometimes a single urine sample is collected and sometimes two separate samples may be collected, with the first discarded and the second collected after a measured time. Rarely, saliva samples are collected from the mouth using a swab. Blood, urine, and saliva samples must be sent to a laboratory for analysis.


","



Ethanol is the intoxicating ingredient in alcoholic beverages such as beer, wine, and liquor. This test measures the amount of ethanol in the blood, urine, breath, or saliva.
When ethanol is consumed, the gastrointestinal tract absorbs it. Ethanol is then carried throughout the body in the blood. The body eliminates small amounts of ethanol in the urine or from the lungs upon exhalation, but the liver processes (metabolizes) most ethanol.
The liver can process about one drink an hour, with one drink being defined as the amount of ethanol in 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of whisky. A person who drinks more than one drink an hour will have an increased level of ethanol in the blood. However, certain factors affect the metabolism of alcohol, especially the amount of food consumed prior to and during drinking. The rate of metabolism can also vary with age, gender, weight, concurrent medications, and genetic status.
Drinking alcoholic beverages faster than the liver can process can result in an elevated level of ethanol in the blood. This leads to signs and symptoms of intoxication such as bloodshot eyes, flushed face, slurred speech, slow response to questions or comments, impaired judgment, decreased motor skills, drowsiness or falling asleep, and/or vomiting.
With a very high blood ethanol, more serious signs and symptoms of toxicity may appear such as confusion, stupor, staggering, irregular or slow breathing, loss of consciousness, seizures, and low body temperature (hypothermia). A very high blood ethanol can be fatal.
Long-term, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of several medical problems such as liver disease, cardiovascular problems, depression and anxiety. (Read more about this in the article on Alcoholism.)

When someone has signs and symptoms that suggest intoxication or ethanol poisoning; when a person is suspected of violating drinking-related laws, or as part of a drug testing panel


","



Medical ethanol testing is ordered when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest intoxication such as:

Bloodshot, glassy, or watery eyes
Flushed face
Droopy eyelids
Blank stare or dazed look
Twitching or body tremors
Thick, slurred, or loud speech
Rambling train of thought
Unusually fast or slow talking
Slow response to questions or comments
Repetitive or irrational statements
Lethargy, drowsiness or falling asleep
Vomiting

With higher blood ethanol levels, more serious signs and symptoms may appear. These may include:

Confusion, stupor
Staggering
Irregular (long gaps between breaths) or slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)
Unconsciousness
Seizures
Blue-tinged skin or pale skin
Low body temperature (hypothermia)

Medical testing may also be done on a regular basis to ensure that a person who is being treated is not continuing to abuse ethanol.
Legal ethanol testing may be ordered when there is suspicion that a person has not followed a drinking-related law and whenever there has been an accident or unexpected death. Employment alcohol testing may be performed randomly and when the employer suspects that an employee has alcohol in his or her system while on the job. Insurance testing is primarily performed when someone is applying for a policy.



","



For medical testing, the detection of ethanol in a sample indicates that a person has likely been drinking, and the concentration present can give an indication of the degree of intoxication. Symptoms and complications may vary significantly from person to person. The individual's general health, age, and other medications or drugs that he or she is taking can all affect an individual's symptoms. The ability to clear the alcohol out of the body also depends on the health and function of the person's liver.
For legal testing, results obtained are compared to legal allowable limits.
The table below lists some possible interpretations of blood ethanol results:



Blood Ethanol Result
Interpretation


Equal to or above 80 mg/dL (0.08%)
Legal intoxication in all states


80 to 400 mg/dL (0.08% to 0.40%)
Increasing impairment and depression of central nervous system likely


Above 400 mg/dL (>0.40%)
Loss of consciousness likely; potentially fatal



Someone who chronically consumes significant amounts of ethanol can develop a tolerance to it and may show fewer signs and symptoms and visible impairment at a higher blood alcohol level than someone who does not consume ethanol as often.



","



Different ethanol sample results are not interchangeable. Breath samples are considered to be good estimates of blood alcohol concentrations in most people but can be affected by alcohol consumption within the last few minutes, ketones, released into the breath by some diabetics and dieters, and by other substances that contain alcohol, such as mouthwash and cough syrup.
Urine concentrations lag behind blood concentrations. Peak urine alcohol levels are reached 45 to 60 minutes after alcohol ingestion, at which time levels are typically about 1.3 times greater than the corresponding blood alcohol concentration, but this can be affected by various factors. Sometimes two separate samples may be collected with the first discarded and the second collected after a measured time (20-30 minutes) and tested for ethanol. This practice provides better correlation between urine and blood ethanol levels.
Urine samples that contain both glucose and bacteria or yeast (such as may be seen in some diabetics) should not be left at room temperature for extended periods of time as there is the potential for the microorganisms present to ferment the glucose in the sample and produce ethanol. This can also be seen in post-mortem samples. Occasionally, two serotonin metabolites, 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) and 5-HTOL (5-hydroxytryptphol), may be tested to evaluate this phenomenon and confirm ethyl alcohol ingestion. An increased ratio of 5-HTOL/5-HIAA can be indicative of alcohol consumption.
Children frequently develop low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) along with ethanol poisoning, so healthcare practitioners may order blood glucose tests along with ethanol tests if they suspect ethanol toxicity in youngsters.



",,"



The ethanol test, commonly known as alcohol test, is used for both medical and legal purposes. Samples and results for each use are usually collected and tested separately.
Medical: medical testing is used to determine the level of ethanol in the blood in order to effectively treat the intoxicated person's symptoms. Blood is the most common sample used for medical alcohol tests. The tests may be ordered for a person who presents to the emergency room with signs and symptoms suggesting ethanol toxicity.
Metabolites of ethanol, including ethyl glucuronide or ethyl sufate, can also be examined. Additional tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), glucose, and electrolyte measurement, are often ordered at the same time because there are a variety of other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to ethanol intoxication.
Overdose testing, drugs of abuse testing, and testing for the presence of other toxic alcohols such as methanol and isopropyl alcohol may also be performed if a person is suspected of ingesting or using other substances.
Legal (Forensic): legal testing is used to identify the presence of alcohol and to evaluate its presence in the context of a variety of different laws. Legal testing must have a strict chain-of-custody. Testing may be ordered to determine, for example, whether:

A driver has a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that is over the legal limit
An under-age minor has been drinking
Someone on parole has abstained from alcohol
Alcohol consumption has contributed to an accident

Post-mortem ethanol testing may be done to determine whether alcohol contributed to a person's death.
Legal ethanol testing may also be performed randomly as part of an employer's drug testing program or it may be performed ""with cause"" as part of an investigation after an on-the-job accident has occurred. It may also be done as part of an application for life insurance. These uses are considered legal alcohol tests because they require chain-of-custody documents.
Samples tested for legal purposes may include blood, breath, urine, and/or saliva. Breath testing is the most common test performed on drivers. It uses a conversion factor to estimate the amount of alcohol in the blood.
Blood ethanol testing may be ordered to confirm or refute findings and/or ordered as an alternative to breath testing. Urine testing may also be performed as an alternative. Usually, a person collects and discards a urine sample and then collects a second sample 20 to 30 minutes later. The amount of alcohol in the first sample will be variable because it is unknown how long the urine has been in the bladder. The second sample will reflect a timed sample and a conversion factor can then be used to estimate blood alcohol. A random urine sample is sometimes ordered to monitor people for the presence of alcohol. Saliva alcohol testing is not as widely used but may be used as an alternate screening test.

An extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) panel detects the presence of autoantibodies in the blood that react with proteins in the cell nucleus. These proteins are known as ""extractable"" because they can be removed from cell nuclei using saline and represent six main proteins (Ro, La, Sm, RNP, Scl-70 and Jo1).
Autoantibodies are produced when a person's immune system mistakenly targets and attacks the body's own tissues. This attack can cause inflammation, tissue damage, and other signs and symptoms that are associated with an autoimmune disorder.
Certain autoimmune disorders are characteristically associated with the presence of one or more anti-ENA antibodies. Autoantibody association can aid in the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder and help distinguish between other autoimmune disorders.
The ENA panel typically consists of a group of 4 or 6 autoantibody tests. The number of tests performed will depend on the laboratory and the needs of the healthcare practitioners and patients it serves. Individual ENA panel tests can also be ordered separately.
A 4-test ENA panel will include:

When your antinuclear antibody (ANA) test is positive and you have symptoms that suggest an autoimmune disorder; when monitoring the activity of an autoimmune disorder


","



An ENA panel is ordered when a person has signs and symptoms that could be due to an autoimmune disorder and has a positive ANA test. Signs and symptoms of autoimmune disorders are highly variable and can involve several different areas of the body. They may include:

Fever and persistent fatigue
Muscle pain
Joint swelling and/or pain
Skin rash
Hair loss or loss of scalp hair
Sensitivity to ultraviolet light
Raynaud phenomenon
Protein in the urine (proteinuria)
Neurologic symptoms such as seizures, depression, psychoses
Hemolytic anemia (low red blood cell count) or leukopenia (low white blood cell count)
	 

An ENA panel will not be ordered when a person has a negative ANA test. The ANA test evaluates the presence or absence of autoantibodies, while the ENA panel aims to determine to what proteins in the cell nucleus the autoantibodies recognize. If an ANA test is negative, then the person is extremely unlikely to test positive for a specific antinuclear antibody (which is what the ENA panel tests).
The ENA panel, or one or more of its component tests, may be repeated when initial test results are negative but clinical signs and symptoms persist. Testing may also be ordered when a person has been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder and at some point develops symptoms that may be due to an additional autoimmune disorder. A healthcare practitioner also may order testing to monitor the activity and/or progression of a known autoimmune disorder.



","



Diagnoses of autoimmune diseases are typically based on the characteristic signs and symptoms and on results of autoantibody tests. ENA panel results aid in detecting and distinguishing between different autoimmune disorders. Studies have shown that each of these autoantibodies is frequently detected in people who have a specific autoimmune disorder and is less frequently detected or not detected in those without the disease.
The pattern of positive and negative results obtained with an ENA panel is evaluated in conjunction with the person's clinical findings (signs and symptoms). If someone has clinical findings that suggest a specific autoimmune disorder and the corresponding ENA autoantibody is positive, then it is likely that the person has that condition.
If an individual has symptoms but the autoantibody is not present, it may mean that symptoms are due to another condition.
Interpretation of results for the tests included in an ENA panel are provided in the table below. A positive test result means that the person has more of that autoantibody in their blood than the designated reference value.



Autoantibody Test
Results That Support an Autoimmune Disorder Diagnosis


Anti-RNP
Positive result seen in 95-100% of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) cases; may also be positive with lupus and scleroderma


Anti-Sm
Positive result seen in 30% of those with lupus; very specific antibody marker for this disease


Anti-SS-A (Ro)
Positive result seen in 75% of those with Sjögren syndrome; may also be positive with lupus and scleroderma


Anti-SS-B (La)
Positive result seen in 60% of those with Sjögren syndrome; may also be positive with lupus and scleroderma; rarely present without anti-SS-A


Anti-Scl-70
Positive result seen in 60% of those with scleroderma; highly specific antibody marker for this disease


Anti-Jo-1
Positive result seen in 30% of those with polymyositis; may be positive with pulmonary fibrosis

ENA are referred to as ""extractable"" or ""saline-extracted"" because of the laboratory method originally used to discover and work with these antigens. More than 100 antigens have been identified in this way, but only a few are clinically relevant and routinely tested.



","



The ENA panel may be used as follow-up testing to a positive ANA test to help diagnose an autoimmune disorder. Testing may be used to help distinguish between autoimmune disorders as well as to monitor autoimmune disease progression.
The 4-test ENA panel is used to help diagnose mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), lupus (SLE), and Sjögren syndrome. The 6-test ENA panel can also help identify scleroderma and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. For more on these diseases, see the links under Related Content below.

To determine whether you have an inherited gene mutation that increases your risk of developing a blood clot, including a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Factor V Leiden and prothrombin 20210 (PT 20210 or Factor II mutation) are genetic mutations that are associated with an increased risk of developing inappropriate blood clots. These mutations are tested by two separate tests that evaluate a person's DNA to look for the mutations. The two tests are often performed together to help determine if an individual has an inherited risk for excessive clotting.
Factor V and prothrombin are coagulation factors (sometimes called clotting factors), two of a group of proteins essential for proper blood clot formation. When an injury occurs and bleeding starts, a process called hemostasis begins to form a plug at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Blood cells called platelets adhere to and aggregate at the injury site, and a coagulation cascade begins to activate coagulation factors in sequence. Eventually, a blood clot forms. Once the area has healed, the blood clot dissolves.
There must be an adequate number of each of the coagulation factors, and each must function normally in order for a stable blood clot to form and then dissolve when no longer needed. A deficiency in clotting factors (quantitative defect) or clotting factors that do not work properly (qualitative defect) can lead to excessive bleeding or clotting (thrombosis).
Factor V Leiden and PT 20210 are two mutations that individuals may inherit from their parents that may cause an increased risk of excessive clotting. They are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. A person may inherit one mutated gene copy and be heterozygous or may inherit two mutated gene copies and be homozygous. This may determine to what extent the person is affected. (For additional details, read the section on Autosomal Dominant Inheritance in the Genetic Disorders article.)
These two mutations are independent and are tested separately, but the tests are often performed at the same time as part of the investigation of a blood clot (thrombotic episode) in someone who is suspected of having an inherited risk factor for an excessive clotting (hypercoagulable) disorder. Each test is used to identify whether or not the specific mutation is present and to determine whether the person has one copy (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of that mutation.

During blood clotting, factor V is normally inactivated by a protein called activated protein C (APC) to prevent the blood clot from growing too large. But a factor V Leiden genetic mutation can lead to an altered factor V protein that resists inactivation by APC. The result is that clotting remains more active than usual, increasing risks of a blood clot forming in the deep veins of legs (DVT) or breaking off and blocking a vein (venous thromboembolism or VTE).
During blood clotting, an enzyme converts prothrombin to form thrombin. A mutation in the gene that codes for prothrombin called prothrombin 20210 can lead to increased amount of prothrombin and therefore abnormal clotting and an increased risk of a DVT or VTE.

When you have had an unexplained blood clot (thrombotic episode), especially when you are less than 50 years old, have recurrent DVT or VTE episodes, experienced DVT or VTE during pregnancy, had DVT at unusual sites, or have a strong family history of thrombosis


","



Factor V Leiden mutation and PT 20210 tests are ordered when it is suspected that a person has an inherited risk factor for blood clots, for example, when an individual:

Has a first deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) before age 50
Has recurring DVT or PE
Has a blood clot in an unusual part of the body such as the veins of the liver (hepatic), the kidneys (renal), the brain (cerebral), the gut and pelvis (mesenteric), or in the eye veins
Has a personal or family history of recurrent DVT or VTE
Has a first VTE related to oral contraceptive use, pregnancy or hormone replacement therapy 
Experiences unexplained miscarriages, especially those occurring in the second or third trimester of pregnancy

These tests may be ordered when a first-degree family member, such as parent or sibling, has a factor V Leiden or PT 20210 gene mutation. However, a panel assembled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to evaluate practical genomics recommended in 2011 that if the goal is to decide on treatment with anticoagulant medication, adults without VTE symptoms do not need to be tested even if their family members have the PT 20210 or the factor V Leiden mutation.
If asymptomatic family members know that they have one or more of the mutations, they may be motivated to address controllable clotting risk factors such as oral contraceptive use, smoking, and elevated levels of homocysteine and be more aware of the potential risks of factor(s) triggering events, such as immobilization and surgery. However, many of those with the mutation will never experience a DVT or VTE.



","



If genetic testing indicates that an individual has one factor V Leiden or PT 20210 gene copy, then the person is heterozygous; if there are two copies, then the person is homozygous for the mutation.

Factor V Leiden mutation is the most common inherited predisposition to excessive clotting in the United States and it is most common in the Caucasian population. Between 3 and 8% of U.S. Caucasians carry one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation and about 1 in 5,000 people have two copies of the mutation. While homozygous cases of factor V Leiden are more rare, they also carry a higher risk of thrombosis. People with two copies of the mutation may have up to 80 times the risk of thrombophilia while those with one copy have 4 to 8 times the risk, compared to those who do not carry the mutation. 
Someone with a PT 20210 mutation may be heterozygous or homozygous, although it is very rare to find individuals who are homozygous. The affected heterozygous person will have a mild to moderate increase in their thrombin production, which is associated with 2.5 to 3 fold greater risk of developing a venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Caucasians; there is not enough information about risk in those who are homozygous. Although PT 20210 is less common in the U.S. than factor V Leiden, about 2 to 4% of Caucasians, usually of European ancestry, have a variation in the prothrombin gene. In the U.S., approximately 1 in 250 African Americans have the mutation.

The risk of excessive clotting from these mutation(s) varies from person to person. If you are asymptomatic, you may never have a DVT and/or VTE. If you have had one or more blood clots, then the mutation(s) is the most likely cause and you have an increased risk for another clot. If no mutations are found, then it is likely that the condition is due to another cause.
The risks that are associated with factor V Leiden, PT 20210, and other inherited and acquired factor deficiencies are independent. A person can have more than one risk factors for harmful blood clots, and their associated risks are cumulative. Added to inherited risks and acquired risks are controllable risk factors, such as use of oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), that may worsen the combined underlying risk factors. For instance, if a woman has one gene copy with the factor V Leiden variant, she may be at about a 2 to 4 fold greater risk of developing a VTE. If she also uses oral contraceptives, the combined risk can increase to 35 times the risk for factor V Leiden heterozygosity alone, and women with factor V Leiden who take HRT have a 15-fold higher risk.



","



Sometimes, evaluation for the presence of a factor V Leiden mutation can begin with a test for activated protein C (APC) resistance, though it is not commonly performed nowadays. About 90% of the time, APC resistance is due to a factor V Leiden mutation, and the APC resistance ratio assay has a greater than 99% sensitivity for detecting a factor V Leiden mutation. If resistance is present, then a test for the factor V Leiden gene mutation is performed on the person's DNA, both to confirm the diagnosis and to determine whether the person has one or two copies of the mutation (is heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation).
Some studies have found a significant association between factor V Leiden mutation and recurrent miscarriages.



","



Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and prothrombin 20210 (PT 20210) mutation tests are two tests often used together to help diagnose the cause of inappropriate blood clot (thrombus) formation, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Testing for factor V Leiden and PT 20120 mutations is used to help determine if an individual has inherited a disorder associated with blood clots and can determine whether the person has one copy or two copies of the mutation (heterozygous or homozygous.)
These tests may be ordered to help determine the reason for an initial harmful blood clot (thrombotic episode), especially when it occurs in a person under 50 years old, is unprovoked, or is in an unusual place such as the liver (hepatic), the kidneys (renal), the brain (cerebral), the gut and pelvis (mesenteric), or in the eye veins. These tests may also be ordered if VTE is recurrent or there is a strong family history of thrombosis.
Experts do not recommend screening the general population and are divided on testing family members of those with a factor V Leiden or PT 20210 mutation. If the mutation is present, then the person is at a higher risk for developing a blood clot, but there is variability in how the gene is actually expressed. With factor V Leiden, for example, only 10% of those with the factor V Leiden mutation will ever have a thrombotic episode.

This test measures the amount of fat in a stool sample. Excess fecal fat (termed steatorrhea) may be an indication that your digestive system is not working properly and/or that you have a condition affecting the digestion of food and absorption of nutrients (malabsorption).
The body digests foods in stages: proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are broken down, in the stomach by acid and enzymes and in the small intestines by enzymes produced by the pancreas and bile from the liver, into their component parts. They are then absorbed, primarily in the small intestines. Finally, the nutrients are transported throughout the body and used or stored.

If there are not enough pancreatic enzymes or bile available, then fat and other foods cannot be properly digested and cannot be efficiently absorbed. If a condition prevents the intestines from absorbing nutrients, then they are eliminated in the stool. In both cases – improper digestion or absorption – you can experience symptoms associated with malabsorption and, in severe cases, symptoms of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency. If the condition prevents you from digesting and absorbing fats from the diet, then excess fat is present in the stool and you may experience persistent diarrhea with stools that are loose and foul-smelling (steatorrhea).

Fat in stool may be detected with the qualitative fecal fat test, which generally determines the presence or absence of excess fat. This test is performed by placing a suspension of treated or untreated stool onto a glass slide, adding a fat stain, and observing the number and size of fat globules that are present. It should be performed by an experienced professional.
Quantitative measurements of fecal fat, though somewhat more accurate, are less commonly performed. However, they are considered the gold standard. They require a timed stool collection and a dietary sheet to help calculate the total fat intake during the collection period, usually a 72-hour stool collection. Results are reported as the amount of fat eliminated in stool per day (24 hours).
Another quantitative test is called the acid steatocrit, which provides a rapid but less exact measure of the amount of fat in the stool. It is a less complicated test that can be used on a random stool sample.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For a 72-hour stool collection, save all stool during the collection time period in the container(s) provided. It may be collected in a variety of ways, such as on plastic wrap, but should not be contaminated by urine, toilet water, or toilet paper. For a random sample, collect a single specimen in the same fashion.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For a 72-hour stool collection, follow your healthcare provider's instructions and dietary recommendations. This may include consuming a fat-controlled diet containing 50-150 grams of fat a day for 2-3 days prior to and during the stool collection period. You will also be asked to avoid certain oils and fat substitutes during the collection as these can invalidate the test result. You may also be asked to discontinue using exogenous pancreatic supplements if you are using any.

When you have symptoms of malabsorption, such as persistent diarrhea and fatty stools


","



A fecal fat test is primarily ordered when you have signs and symptoms of malabsorption such as:

Fatty stools that are loose and foul-smelling (steatorrhea)
Persistent diarrhea
Abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, and gas
Weight loss
Failure to thrive (in children)

These symptoms may or may not be accompanied by other indicators such as fatigue, anemia and/or specific nutritional deficiencies in, for example, iron or vitamin B12.



","



A positive qualitative fecal fat test or an increased amount of fat in a 72-hour quantitative fecal fat test indicates that fat is likely not being absorbed normally and that you may have impaired digestion or malabsorption. (Quantitative results are typically reported as grams per day or g/d.)
Malabsorption is seen with a wide variety of diseases and conditions. Examples include:

Diseases affecting the intestines such as:
	
Infections, including parasitic, bacterial or viral
Celiac disease
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis)


Pancreatic insufficiency caused by:
	
Chronic pancreatitis
Pancreatic cancer
Cystic fibrosis (affects the function of the pancreas)
Shwachman-Diamond Syndrome


Gallbladder diseases and conditions of the bile ducts
	
Cancer
Narrowing or blockage of the common bile duct, the main tube that carries bile from the liver and gallbladder to the intestines



Other laboratory tests used in conjunction with the fecal fat test are usually required to determine the underlying cause of fat malabsorption.
In a 72-hour fecal fat test, a low level of fecal fat generally indicates that you are digesting and absorbing fats normally and suggests that the symptoms being experienced are likely due to another cause.



","



Laxatives, enemas, barium, mineral oil, fat-blocking supplements, psyllium fiber, and fat substitutes may affect test results.
Children cannot ingest as much daily fat as adults. Their test preparation will be adjusted, and their 72-hour fecal fat test results will typically be reported as a percentage. This result is a ""coefficient"" that compares the amount of fat eaten to the amount eliminated in order to evaluate the quantity of fat absorbed.
Although 72 hours is the typical sample collected for a quantitative fecal fat, a healthcare provider may sometimes ask for a 24-hour or 48-hour stool sample instead. 



","



Fecal fat testing is typically ordered along with or as a follow up to other stool tests and blood tests to investigate the cause of chronic diarrhea and loose, fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea).
Stool tests may include:

Fecal immunochemical test and fecal occult blood test – to detect blood in the stool
O&P (ova and parasite exam) – to detect parasites
Fecal white blood cells – to detect white blood cells in the stool; excess white blood cells can be a sign of gut infection or inflammation.
Fecal elastase – a protein-cleaving enzyme produced and secreted by the pancreas; it is resistant to degradation by other enzymes and so is excreted and can be measured in the stool. The amount of this enzyme is reduced in pancreatic insufficiency.
Fecal fat, qualitative – usually a suspension of stool placed on a glass slide that is treated with a special stain and examined under the microscope to detect the presence of fat droplets

Blood tests may be ordered to further investigate malabsorption symptoms and may include:

Complete blood count (CBC) – to evaluate red and white blood cells
Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) – to evaluate liver function, proteins, and electrolytes
Celiac disease antibody tests – to detect this condition

Tests for cystic fibrosis may be performed as part of the investigation. Pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis leads to maldigestion and malabsorption:

Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT)
Sweat chloride test
CF gene mutation panel

A qualitative fecal fat may be ordered as a screening test. If it is positive for excess fecal fat, then a quantitative test is generally not necessary.
If the qualitative fecal fat is negative and your healthcare provider still suspects excess fecal fat, then a 72-hour quantitative fecal fat test may be ordered. This is a better evaluation of fat digestion and absorption. There are two reasons for this:

For the quantitative test, you are required to include a moderately high amount of fat in your diet per day prior to and during sample collection so your ability to absorb fat ""challenged.""
Fat is not released into the stool at a constant rate so results from collecting stool over 72 hours gives a more accurate picture of average absorption and elimination than a single sample.

fecal-immunochemical-test-and-fecal-occult-blood-test,"['Stool Occult Blood', 'Fecal Occult Blood Test', 'FOBT', 'Guaiac-based FOBT', 'gFOBT', 'Fecal Immunochemical Test', 'FIT', 'iFOBT', 'Hemoccult']","

For the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), which is the preferred test, no preparation is necessary. For the guaiac-based FOBT (gFOBT, FOBT), you will be instructed to avoid certain medications and follow certain dietary restrictions for several days before collecting the stool samples.


","

To screen for digestive tract bleeding, which may be an indicator of colon cancer


","

Stool samples are required. The sampling procedure depends on the choice of test, and the samples may be collected in the privacy of your home. (See the section ""What is being tested?"" below for more details.)


","



Both the FIT and FOBT are designed to evaluate stool samples for hidden (""occult"") blood, meaning blood that cannot be seen with the naked eye. Although there are several possible causes of blood in the stool, one important cause is the presence of polyps or cancers in the digestive tract.
Colon polyps are common as people age, but most polyps do not cause any health problems and are benign. However, a benign polyp can turn into a cancerous polyp and the cancer may even spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). If detected early, colon cancer can be successfully treated. It is therefore important to determine whether pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps are present.
Polyps are finger-like growths that protrude into the cavity (lumen) of the colon or the rectum. They can be fragile and bleed intermittently, such as when food waste brushes against them. This blood is mixed in with the stool and when the amounts are small, the blood can only be detected by tests for occult blood. This small amount of blood may be the first and sometimes the only sign of polyps or early colon cancer, making the stool-based tests valuable screening tools.
There are two principal methods for detecting occult blood in the stool. They are designed to detect hemoglobin, a molecule that is present in red blood cells. Hemoglobin has two essential parts: a chemical part called heme and a protein part called globin. Each method tests for a different part of the hemoglobin molecule.

The Immunochemical method (FIT) tests for the globin (protein) part of hemoglobin and FITs are designed to specifically detect human globin. FIT generally will not detect globin from non-human blood such as found in beef and other meats, thereby making them superior to other tests. Hemoglobin from bleeding in the upper digestive tract is broken down before it reaches the lower digestive tract and so upper GI bleeds are not usually detected by the FIT. However, most health organizations, including the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer and the American Cancer Society recommend this test for screening for colon cancer.
The guaiac-based tests (gFOBT, FOBT) measure the heme (non-protein) part of hemoglobin from blood in the stool. Since the heme part of hemoglobin is common to blood from all sources, this method identifies the presence of blood from any source. This means that FOBTs will measure not only your blood but also blood from any dietary source, such as red meat, thereby causing false-positive test results. Compared to the FIT, these methods have other limitations. Some foods and medications can interfere with this method, so you may be instructed to avoid them for a few days prior to testing. Since the heme part of hemoglobin is resistant to degradation in the intestine, these tests also detect blood from other areas of the digestive tract, such as from bleeding stomach ulcers and bleeding gums. They are therefore less specific than the FIT for the detection of bleeding from the colon.

How is the sample collected for testing?
Typically, you will be supplied with a kit to use at home. The collection method may vary based on the specific manufacturer of the kit. Follow the instructions that are provided with the kit. Multiple stool samples may have to be collected on different days and after the last sample is taken, all of the samples are brought to or mailed to your healthcare practitioner or laboratory.

For FIT, a common approach is to use a brush or other device to collect a sample from the surface of a stool, which is then inserted into a sample tube containing a solution and sent for testing. Generally, a single sample is required.
For guaiac-based FOBT, the healthcare practitioner or laboratory will provide a test card that can have 1, 2 or 3 sections. The triple card is most commonly used. Stool should be collected into clean containers and should not be contaminated with urine or water. Using an applicator stick, a sample is collected from the surface of the stool and placed onto the specially treated pad on the test card and allowed to dry. When using cards with multiple test areas, the samples for each test area are collected on different days. For example, a 3-section card requires 3 stools, each collected on a different day. Collecting and testing multiple stool samples increases the chance of detecting cancer if it is present.

Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For the FIT, there are no particular restrictions prior to testing. The test uses antibodies to detect only human blood from the lower digestive tract (colon).
For guaiac FOBTs, there are various restrictions:

These tests detect the heme part of any blood that may be in the digestive tract. Therefore, steps should be taken to avoid introducing blood from any source other than your own into the digestive tract for a few days prior to the test. This includes avoiding various meats and especially red meat.
Blood that arises from bleeding gums (caused by dental procedures or gum disease) may be detected by these tests. Avoid having any dental procedures up to three days before beginning to collect stool samples.
Stomach bleeds such as caused by ulcers should be controlled prior to testing.
Bleeding in the stomach may be triggered by the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, naproxen, and ibuprofen. Avoid taking these drugs for seven days prior to testing, if clinically possible.
The test relies on a chemical reaction to produce the color change that gives a positive test. Foods such as broccoli, turnips, cauliflower and apples, and drugs such as colchicine may make the test appear positive even in the absence of blood (a false-positive result). If instructed to do so, avoid these foods and drugs three days prior to and during the testing period.
Vitamin C, on the other hand, interferes with the chemical reaction and prevents the color formation that should occur when blood is present (a false-negative result). Vitamin C supplements and fruit juices that contain vitamin C should be avoided three days prior to and during testing.

Follow the instructions provided by your healthcare practitioner or included in test kit. Check with your healthcare provider before stopping any drugs to be certain that it is safe to do so.

The American Cancer Society recommends screening for colon cancer between the ages of 45 and 75, while the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend screening starting at age 50. Screening annually is usually recommended if an occult blood test is used.
When there is a suspicion that you have gastrointestinal bleeding



","



The American Cancer Society (ACS), the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend yearly testing when you choose occult blood testing (FIT or FOBT) as the method of screening for colon cancer. The ACS advises that people of average risk begin screening at age 45. The MSTF and USPSTF advise that screening for colon cancer begin at age 50.
A healthcare practitioner may sometimes order an FOBT when someone has unexplained anemia that might be caused by bleeding in the digestive tract.



","



A negative fecal occult blood test means no blood was detected in the stool at the time of the test.
For the FIT, a positive result indicates abnormal bleeding in the lower digestive tract. While this bleeding could be caused by colon cancer, other possible causes include ulcers, polyps or hemorrhoids.
For the guaiac-based FOBT, a positive test result indicates that abnormal bleeding may be occurring somewhere in the digestive tract. This blood loss could be due colon cancer or to cancerous tumors. It could also be due to benign polyps, to ulcers, diverticulosis, inflammatory bowel disease, hemorrhoids or to blood swallowed due to bleeding gums or nosebleeds.
A positive result from either method requires follow-up testing. This usually involves direct imaging of the colon and rectum. A colonoscopy is typically recommended because it allows examination of the colon and the removal of any precancerous polyps and/or cancerous areas that are found.



","



Bleeding, especially from polyps and tumors, is intermittent, so blood is not uniformly distributed in all stool samples. Taking multiple samples on different days increases the chance of detecting bleeding that is intermittent. This is especially true for FOBT. The FIT is more sensitive, so a single sample is usually considered acceptable.
An occult blood test (FIT or FOBT) can give a false-negative result if the cancer or polyps do not bleed during the time the sample is taken. In the absence of polyps or colon cancer, a false-positive result may be obtained if you have bleeding from other sources, such as hemorrhoids, ulcers and inflammatory bowel disease.
Both FIT and FOBT can be performed in people with common hemoglobin disorders (hemoglobinopathies), such as sickle cell disease.



","



The main use of tests for occult blood in the stool (FIT and FOBT) is to screen for colon polyps or early colon cancer in people with average risk. Blood in the stool may be the only sign of early colon cancer. If detected early, treatment can begin immediately, improving the chance of a cure. Persons with average risk include those without a family history of colon cancer and those without certain genetic diseases.
The FIT is preferred over the gFOBT because it is better at detecting cancer and it doesn't require dietary restrictions before testing, according to the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer.
For people with an increased or high risk of colon cancer, a colonoscopy is usually recommended for screening because it is the most accurate and thorough screen available. See the article on Colon Cancer or the health screening articles for Adults and Adults age 50 and older for additional details.
A secondary use of occult blood testing is to help determine if a person's anemia is due to blood loss in the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract), such as from a bleeding ulcer. If someone has signs and symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, a low hemoglobin and hematocrit level, and/or unusually dark stools, a healthcare practitioner may order the FOBT. As noted above, the FOBT can detect blood from any part of the GI tract, while the FIT is more reliable in cases of bleeding from the lower part of the GI tract.

ferritin,['Serum Ferritin'],"

You may be instructed to have your blood drawn in the morning and/or fast for 12 hours before the test; in this case, only water is permitted. Follow any instructions from your healthcare practitioner and/or from the laboratory performing the test.

To determine your body's total iron storage capacity; to help diagnose iron deficiency or iron overload


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Ferritin is a protein that contains iron and is the primary form of iron stored inside of cells. The small amount of ferritin that is released and circulates in the blood is a reflection of the total amount of iron stored in the body. This test measures the amount of ferritin in the blood.
Iron is an essential trace element and nutrient that, among other functions, is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.
In healthy people, most of the iron absorbed by the body is incorporated into the hemoglobin of red blood cells. Most of the remaining is stored as ferritin or as hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes. Ferritin and hemosiderin are present primarily in the liver but also in the bone marrow, spleen, and skeletal muscles.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops, iron stores are depleted and ferritin levels decrease. This may occur because:

Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease
There is an increased need for iron such as during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer).

Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron-deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. (Read the article on Anemia to learn more.)
Conversely, iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a rare genetic disease in which the body absorbs too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overload can occur when a person undergoes repeated blood transfusions.

When you have low hemoglobin and hematocrit on a complete blood count (CBC); when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have too little iron (iron deficiency) or too much iron (iron overload) in the body


","



The ferritin test may be ordered, along with other iron tests, when a routine complete blood count (CBC) shows that a person's hemoglobin and hematocrit are low and their red blood cells are smaller and paler than normal (microcytic and hypochromic), suggesting iron deficiency anemia even though other clinical symptoms may not have developed yet.
A ferritin test as well as other iron-related tests may be ordered when a person develops signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia such as:

Chronic fatigue/tiredness
Weakness
Dizziness
Headaches
Pale skin (pallor)

A ferritin level may also be ordered when iron overload is suspected. Signs and symptoms of iron overload will vary from person to person and tend to worsen over time. They are due to iron accumulation in the blood and tissues. They may include:

Joint pain
Fatigue, weakness
Weight loss
Lack of energy
Abdominal pain
Loss of sex drive
Organ damage, such as in the heart and liver

To confirm the presence of iron overload, other iron tests (iron, TIBC) and a genetic test for hereditary hemochromatosis may be ordered as well.

Ferritin levels are often evaluated in conjunction with other iron tests. A summary of the changes in iron tests seen in various diseases of iron status is shown in the table below.

Iron deficiency
The early stage of iron deficiency is the slow depletion of iron stores. This means there is still enough iron to make red cells but the stores are being used up without adequate replacement. The serum iron level may be normal in this stage, but the ferritin level will be low.
As iron deficiency continues, all of the stored iron is used and the body tries to compensate by producing more transferrin to increase iron transport. The serum iron level continues to decrease and transferrin and TIBC and UIBC increase. As this stage progresses, fewer and smaller red blood cells are produced, eventually resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is decreased with iron deficiency.
Iron overload
If the iron level and transferrin saturation are high, the TIBC, UIBC and ferritin are normal and the person has a clinical history consistent with iron overdose, then it is likely that the person has iron poisoning. Iron poisoning occurs when a large dose of iron is taken all at once or over a short period of time. Iron poisoning in children is almost always acute, occurring in children who ingest their parents' iron supplements. In some cases, acute iron poisoning can be fatal. In patients with chronic iron overload, ferritin levels increase.
A person who has mutations in the HFE gene is diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. However, while many people who have hemochromatosis will have no symptoms for their entire life, others will start to develop symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, and weakness in their 30's or 40's. Men are affected more often than women because women lose blood during their reproductive years through menstruation.
Iron overload may also occur in people who have hemosiderosis and in those who have had repeated transfusions. This may occur with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia major, or other forms of transfusion-dependent anemia. The iron from each transfused unit of blood stays in the body, eventually causing a large buildup in the tissues. Some persons with alcoholism and with chronic liver disease also develop iron overload.



","



Normally, most ferritin is found inside of cells with only a small amount in the blood. Patients with iron overload have high ferritin levels. However, ferritin levels can become elevated under certain condition (e.g., acute illness) even though the total amount of iron in the body is normal.



","



The ferritin test is used to assess a person's iron stores in the body. The test is often ordered along with an iron level and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC, calculated based on blood level of transferrin) to detect a low iron level (iron deficiency) or too much iron in the body (iron overload) as well as to assess the severity of these conditions.

fetal-fibronectin-ffn,['fFN'],"

Anything that physically disturbs the cervix or uterus has the potential to elevate fFN levels. Therefore, your healthcare practitioner should collect the sample before a pelvic examination or vaginal ultrasound. Semen may contain enough fFN to create a positive test result, so sexual intercourse should be avoided within 24 hours of sample collection. Avoid lubricants, lotions, soaps, and douches at least a day before the test.


","

To help evaluate a pregnant woman's risk of preterm delivery


","

A swab is used to take a sample of cervical or vaginal fluid from the posterior portion of the vagina or from the area just outside the opening of the cervix.


","



Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is a protein produced at the boundary between the amniotic sac (which surrounds the baby) and the lining of the mother's uterus (the decidua). Fetal fibronectin is largely confined to this junction and is thought to help ""glue"" or maintain the integrity of the boundary between the amniotic sac and the lining of the uterus. A fetal fibronectin test detects fFN in vaginal fluid to help predict the short-term risk of premature delivery.
According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), a normal pregnancy is about 40 weeks, with a woman going into labor between 37 and 42 weeks. A preterm delivery is one that occurs between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy.
fFN is found in vaginal fluids early in pregnancy because of the normal growth and establishment of tissues at the junction between the amniotic sac and uterus, with levels falling when this phase is complete. fFN is also found in fluids from the vagina after 36 weeks when it is often released into vaginal fluids as the body gets ready for childbirth.
However, fFN should not be detectible between 22 and 35 weeks of pregnancy. Elevated levels during this period reflect a disturbance at the junction between the amniotic sac and the lining of the uterus. Elevated fFN in vaginal fluids during these weeks of pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor and delivery. Many pregnant women experience symptoms that suggest preterm labor. These may include uterine contractions, changes in vaginal discharge, backaches, abdominal discomfort, pelvic pressure, cramping, and dilation of the cervix. However, not all symptomatic women will actually have a preterm delivery. The majority will go on to deliver at term.
Unfortunately, while premature births can have successful endings, serious complications are possible when a baby leaves the womb early. Premature babies frequently have difficulty breathing and feeding. Their lungs and other organs are immature and do not function normally, and the strain on them can cause persistent health problems. The more premature the newborn, the more likely it is that he or she will experience complications.
If a healthcare practitioner thinks that a woman might deliver early, she will consider treatments designed to delay delivery. These treatments can have unwanted side effects, however, so knowing whether or not a woman is likely to deliver prematurely helps in the decision on the best course of action. The fFN test is a relatively noninvasive tool that can help distinguish between those women who are likely to deliver shortly and those who are not.

When you are 22 to 35 weeks pregnant and are having symptoms of premature labor; sometimes if you are at high risk, such as if you have had a previous preterm delivery or have a short cervix


","



The fFN test may be ordered when a woman is 22 weeks to 35 weeks pregnant and has signs and symptoms of preterm labor. These may include:

Uterine contractions
A change in vaginal discharge
Backache
Abdominal discomfort
Pelvic pressure
Cramping
Dilation of the cervix

The fFN test may be repeated after 2 weeks if the first fFN is negative and labor symptoms persist beyond the next 7 to 14 days. The test may therefore be repeated several times since each test result is valid for the following 7 to 14 days.
Sometimes the test may be ordered when a pregnant woman is at high risk of preterm labor, for example, if she has had a previous preterm delivery or has a short cervix.
The fFN test is not meant to be used for women with placental abruption (premature detachment of the placenta), premature rupture of membranes, placenta previa (a placenta attached to the lower portion of the uterus), or moderate to heavy vaginal bleeding.



","



A positive fFN result is not very good at predicting whether a woman is experiencing preterm labor and delivery. However, a negative fFN result is highly predictive that preterm delivery will not occur within the next 2 weeks.
In other words, when the fFN test is performed on a pregnant woman who is experiencing signs and symptoms of preterm labor, a negative test result means that there is a less than 1% chance of her having a premature delivery within the next 2 weeks. A healthcare practitioner will also use other tests and clinical expertise to evaluate each individual situation.
Since there are risks associated with treating a woman for premature labor (in anticipation of a premature delivery), a negative fFN can reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and drug therapies.
A positive fetal fibronectin test is less specific. It is associated with an increased risk for preterm delivery and with neonatal complications, but it will not tell a woman's healthcare provider whether or not she will deliver early. A positive test suggests the need to monitor a symptomatic woman more closely.



","



Vaginal bleeding can interfere with the fFN test. If a pregnant woman is experiencing vaginal bleeding, the test will probably not be performed.



",,"



Fetal fibronectin (fFN) is used to test pregnant women who are between 22 weeks and 35 weeks of pregnancy and are having symptoms of premature labor. The test helps predict the likelihood of premature delivery within the next 7-14 days.
The fFN test should only be used for pregnant women who:

Have intact amniotic membranes
Have a cervix that has not dilated more than 3 centimeters
Have only slight vaginal bleeding
Do not have a cervix that has been sewn shut during pregnancy to help keep the baby in the uterus, a procedure (cervical cerclage) used when someone has a weak cervix

The fFN test is not recommended for screening asymptomatic, low-risk women.

As part of an investigation of a possible bleeding disorder or blood clot (thrombotic episode), particularly to evaluate the level and function of fibrinogen (known as coagulation factor I); sometimes used to help evaluate your risk of developing cardiovascular disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Fibrinogen is a protein, specifically a clotting factor (factor I), that is essential for proper blood clot formation. Two types of tests are available to evaluate fibrinogen. A fibrinogen activity test evaluates how well fibrinogen functions in helping to form a blood clot. A fibrinogen antigen test measures the amount of fibrinogen in the blood.
Fibrinogen is produced by the liver and released into the blood along with several other clotting factors (also called coagulation factors). Normally, when a body tissue or blood vessel wall is injured, a process called hemostasis begins to help stop the bleeding by forming a plug at the injury site. Small cellular fragments called platelets clump and stick to the injury site and clotting factors are activated one after the other. This last part is called the coagulation cascade.
As the cascade nears completion, soluble fibrinogen is converted into insoluble fibrin threads. These threads then crosslink together to form a fibrin net that stabilizes at the injury site. The fibrin net adheres to the site of injury along with the platelets to form a stable blood clot. This barrier prevents additional blood loss and remains in place until the injured area is healed.
For a stable clot to form, there must be enough normally functioning platelets and coagulation factors. Too little, too much, or dysfunctional clotting factors or platelets can lead to bleeding episodes and/or to the formation of an inappropriate blood clot (thrombosis). Several laboratory tests, including fibrinogen tests, can be used to evaluate the clotting process. Fibrinogen testing includes:

A fibrinogen activity test evaluates that part of the clotting process in which soluble fibrinogen is converted into fibrin threads. It measures the time that it takes for a fibrin clot to form after a standard amount of thrombin is added to your blood sample (plasma). The time it takes for a clot to form directly correlates with the amount of active fibrinogen that is present. Prolonged clot-formation times may be due to decreased levels of normal fibrinogen or may be due to fibrinogen that does not function as it should (dysfunctional).
A fibrinogen antigen test measures the level of fibrinogen in a blood sample, including both functional and dysfunctional fibrinogen.

Fibrinogen is also one of several blood factors that are called acute phase reactants. Blood levels of fibrinogen along with other acute phase reactants rise sharply with conditions causing acute tissue inflammation or damage. Tests for these acute phase reactants, including fibrinogen, may be performed to determine the extent of inflammation in the body.

When you have excessive bleeding (e.g., easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, bleeding gums), a harmful blood clot, or both (e.g., DIC); when your prothrombin time (PT) and/or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is prolonged; when you have a relative with a hereditary fibrinogen deficiency or abnormality; sometimes when your healthcare practitioner wants additional information to help evaluate your risk of heart disease


","



A healthcare practitioner may order a fibrinogen activity test when you have:

Unexplained or prolonged bleeding
A harmful blood clot (thrombosis) 
Abnormal PT and PTT test results
Symptoms and signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or undergoing treatment for DIC or abnormal fibrinolysis
Symptoms suggesting an inherited or acquired coagulation factor (clotting protein) deficiency or dysfunction
Been diagnosed with an acquired bleeding disorder to evaluate and monitor your clotting ability (over time)


A fibrinogen antigen test may be performed when you have an abnormally low result on a fibrinogen activity test to help determine whether it is due to low fibrinogen or fibrinogen that does not function properly.
In some cases, fibrinogen testing may be performed along with other cardiac risk markers when your healthcare practitioner wants to have additional information to help evaluate your risk of heart disease.



","



Fibrinogen test results are reported as the concentration of the protein in the blood. Fibrinogen activity tests are converted into concentrations for comparison with fibrinogen antigen results. Results are usually interpreted in the context of results from other tests.
Normal fibrinogen activity results usually reflect normal contribution of fibrinogen to your blood clotting ability.
Significantly decreased fibrinogen activity may be due to a decreased amount of fibrinogen or fibrinogen that does not function as it should. Reduced fibrinogen activity and antigen levels may affect your ability to form a stable blood clot.

Low fibrinogen levels that persist over time (chronic) may be related to the body's inability to produce fibrinogen due to:

	
An acquired condition such as end-stage liver disease or severe malnutrition
A rare inherited condition such as dysfibrinogenemia, afibrinogenemia or hypofibrinogenemia (For details, see below.)


Acutely low levels are often related to conditions in which fibrinogen is used up more quickly than the body can produce it. This can occur with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and abnormal fibrinolysis, which occurs when the body is overactive in breaking down and clearing blood clots.
Reduced fibrinogen levels may also occur following rapid, large-volume blood transfusions.


Sometimes a healthcare practitioner will use a ratio of the antigen test and the activity test. This is to help to distinguish dysfunctional fibrinogen (high ratio) from low fibrinogen (ratio close to 1).
Fibrinogen is an acute phase reactant, meaning that fibrinogen levels may rise sharply in any condition that causes inflammation or tissue damage. High levels of fibrinogen are not specific. They do not tell the healthcare practitioner the cause or location of the inflammation or damage. Usually these increased levels are temporary, returning to normal after the underlying condition has resolved.
Increased fibrinogen levels may be seen with:

Infections
Cancer
Coronary heart disease, heart attack 
Stroke
Inflammatory disorders (like rheumatoid arthritis and glomerulonephritis, a form of kidney disease)
Trauma
Peripheral artery disease
Heavy smoking


While fibrinogen levels are elevated, a person's risk of developing a blood clot may be increased and, over time, they could contribute to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.



","



Blood transfusions within the past month may affect fibrinogen test results.
Certain drugs may cause decreased levels, including anabolic steroids, phenobarbital, streptokinase, urokinase, L-asparaginase, tissue plasminogen activators (t-PA), and valproic acid. Moderate elevations in fibrinogen are sometimes seen with pregnancy, cigarette smoking, and with oral contraceptives or estrogen use.



",,"



This testing is used to evaluate fibrinogen (factor I), a protein that is essential for blood clot formation.
Two types of tests are available:

A fibrinogen activity test measures the function of fibrinogen and its ability to be converted into fibrin. It is used:

	
As part of an investigation of a possible bleeding disorder or inappropriate blood clot formation (thrombotic episode)
As a follow-up to an abnormal bleeding disorder test (prothrombin time, PT or partial thromboplastin time, PTT) and/or an episode of prolonged or unexplained bleeding
Along with tests such as PT, PTT, platelet function tests, fibrin degradation products (FDP), and D-dimer to help diagnose disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or abnormal fibrinolysis
Occasionally to help monitor the status of a progressive disease (such as liver disease) over time or, rarely, to monitor treatment of an acquired condition (such as DIC)
Sometimes along with other cardiac risk markers such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to help determine overall risk of cardiovascular disease. This use of the test has not gained widespread acceptance because there are no direct treatments for elevated levels. However, many healthcare practitioners feel that fibrinogen activity measurements give them additional information that may lead them to be more aggressive in treating those risk factors that they can treat (such as unhealthy levels of LDL cholesterol).


A fibrinogen antigen test is occasionally used as a follow-up test to determine whether decreased fibrinogen activity is due to insufficient fibrinogen or dysfunctional fibrinogen.

To help investigate the cause of hypereosinophilia (HE), a condition with persistent increase in the number of eosinophils, a specific type of white blood cell, or hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is HE with associated tissue or organ damage; to help determine if someone with HE or HES can be treated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as imatinib


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein or a bone marrow sample collected using a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy procedure


","



FIP1L1-PDGFRA is an abnormal fusion gene sequence that causes the bone marrow to produce too many eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. It is a rare cause of hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). This test detects the FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene sequence to help diagnose these conditions.
While some genetic abnormalities are inherited from our parents, they can also come from changes that occur to genes or chromosomes later in life. These are called somatic mutations, which can occur through exposure to various environmental factors (e.g., radiation, certain chemicals), but more often for unknown reasons.
The FIP1LI-PDGFRA gene sequence is one of those genetic changes acquired later in life. It occurs when the chromosome 4 loses approximately 800 nucleotides (DNA building blocks), which normally separate the FIP1L1 and PDGFRA genes. Because of this deletion, the two genes are brought together (fused), producing a new fusion gene. Other types of mutations can also lead to abnormalities of the PDGFRA gene, but this deletion is the most common.
Normally, the PDGFRA gene provides instructions for making a protein that controls processes like cell growth and division. When the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene is present, the gene sequence still provides instructions for making that protein, but the protein that results is abnormal because it is always activated and continues to send signals for growth and division. With constant signals for growth, eosinophils (and sometimes other blood cells) can grow out of control, causing hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which can be fatal if not treated promptly.
Hypereosinophilia (HE) and Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES)
Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in allergic reactions and immune responses to certain parasites. The number of eosinophils in the blood may be elevated with these conditions. Hypereosinophilia is the prolonged overproduction of eosinophils. As increasing numbers of eosinophils move into and inflame tissues, HES develops. HES results when these eosinophils affect and damage a variety of organs, including the heart, lungs and the nervous system.
Common symptoms include chest pain and shortness of breath if the heart is involved. People with HES may also have anemia or excessive clotting (hypercoaguability), stroke, blurred vision or slurred speech. Other symptoms may involve the digestive tract or the skin. Sometimes, there may be no symptoms, when tissue or organ damage is less severe.
There are several causes of HE and HES besides genetic abnormalities. Allergic diseases are the most common cause in the developed world. Parasitic diseases, certain cancers, autoimmune disorders, skin disease, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and Addison disease can also cause HES. If an individual has HES and a healthcare practitioner has ruled out these secondary (reactive) causes, genetic testing can determine if FIP1L1-PDGFRA or other genetic abnormality is the underlying cause. If the genetic abnormality is detected, the HE or HES is neoplastic.
Only 0.4% of people with persistently high numbers of eosinophils carry the FIP1L1-PDGFRA gene. It is most common in individuals between 20 and 50 years old. Although it is a rare cause of HE and HES, it is important to identify it because HE/HES with FIP1L1-PDGFRA can be fatal if not treated. It can be effectively treated with the drug imatinib.

FIP1L1-PDGFRA testing is ordered when CBCs indicate that you have persistently elevated numbers of eosinophils and other causes like allergies, asthma, parasitic infections, adrenal insufficiency, and lymphoma have already been ruled out.
Testing may be ordered after an abnormal eosinophil count when HES is suspected due to your signs and symptoms. (Sometimes there are no early symptoms and the conditions are found only through a routine CBC.)
Examples of common HES signs and symptoms include:

Fever
Fatigue
Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath
Swelling under the skin around the eyes and lips, in the throat, or on the hands and feet
Swollen lymph nodes or organs
Muscle pain
Itching, rash or blistering of the skin
Diarrhea




","



The result of the test may be reported as ""positive"" (the abnormal gene sequence is present) or as ""negative"" (the abnormal gene sequence is not present).
If you have abnormally high numbers of eosinophils and you test positive for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene, then the fusion gene is confirmed as the underlying cause of your hypereosinophilia (HE) or hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Detection of the abnormal fusion gene also indicates the HE or HES is neoplastic.
Note that HE/HES with FIP1L1-PDGFRA may be diagnosed as acute or chronic leukemia, a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or even systemic mastocytosis, based on the World Health Organization's 2008 diagnostic guidelines. Regardless the diagnosis, individuals with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene respond very well to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib.
If you test negative for FIP1L1-PDGFRA, depending on other test results, you may have another type of MPN or MDS or may be diagnosed with HES without a specific cause (idiopathic). FIP1L1-PDGFRA-negative cases of HES do not respond as well to imatinib except for rare cases with PDGFRB rearrangement. (See below for more on this.)



","



Sometimes people develop resistance to imatinib even though the tyrosine kinase inhibitor is usually very effective for treating people with the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene at low doses. For the rare individuals whose HES is resistant to imatinib, stem cell transplants have reversed the organ dysfunction caused by hypereosinophilia. However, healthcare practitioners have limited experience with this treatment, so it is not used routinely. Chemotherapy has also been used with some success for people with the fusion gene who don't respond to treatment with imatinib. Some individuals with the fusion gene are also treated with corticosteroids to lower their eosinophil count and help control organ damage.
People with FIP1L1-PDGFRA may also manifest as acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia, though that is rare. FIP1L1-PDGRA has also been found infrequently in other leukemias and successfully treated with imatinib.



","



This test is used to detect the genetic mutation FIP1L1-PDGFRA, a rare abnormal gene sequence that causes excessive growth of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell.
FIP1L1-PDGFRA testing may be used to help determine the cause of a persistently elevated number of eosinophils, as determined by a complete blood count (CBC), after other tests have ruled out more common secondary (reactive) causes. These other tests may include, for example, allergy blood tests or stool tests for parasites. (See below for more on these.)
FIP1L1-PDGFRA testing may be used to:

Help diagnose the cause of hypereosinophilia (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a type of bone marrow disorder

You may be instructed to have a full bladder when having the nuchal translucency ultrasound performed.

For pregnant women, to assess the risk of your baby having a chromosome disorder, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a blood spot collected on special paper from a finger stick; a nuchal translucency requires a special ultrasound exam.


","



The first trimester screening is a combination of two blood tests and a special ultrasound that are used to assess a pregnant woman's risk of carrying a baby with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18). Performing and evaluating them together, plus considering the woman's age, increases both the sensitivity and specificity of the screening results.

Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) is a protein produced first by the growing placenta. During a normal pregnancy, levels of this protein increase in the pregnant woman's blood until delivery.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced during pregnancy in large quantities by the placenta. Either free beta subunit or total hCG can be used in first trimester screening. Levels of both usually rise rapidly in the pregnant woman's blood for the first 8 to 10 weeks, then decrease and stabilize at a lower level for the remainder of the pregnancy.
Nuchal translucency is measurement made by ultrasound. The ultrasonagrapher measures the fluid collection between the spine and the skin at the nape of the fetus's neck. It is a procedure that requires a specially trained radiologist, proper alignment of the fetus, and careful measurement. It is not a routine ultrasound, and it is not a procedure that is available at every hospital or health facility.

If the results of first trimester screening are cause for concern, diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may be recommended.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Blood is drawn from a vein in the woman's arm or collected from a finger stick. The nuchal translucency ultrasound may be performed from outside the abdomen (transabdominally) or the probe may be inserted into the vagina (transvaginally).
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
You may be instructed to have a full bladder when having the nuchal translucency ultrasound performed.

Your healthcare practitioner may offer you the test between 11 and 14 weeks of pregnancy.



","



A genetic counselor or clinician who can explain the meaning of the results and offer choices about follow up should interpret the screening results.
A mathematical calculation using the results obtained from the PAPP-A, hCG, and nuchal translucency ultrasound is used to determine a numeric risk of a chromosomal defect in the fetus. This risk is compared with an established cut-off. If the risk is higher than the cut-off value (e.g., probability of 1 in 230 or higher), then it is considered a positive screen and the woman may be at increased risk for having a baby with a chromosomal abnormality.
It is important to remember that positive screening tests are not diagnostic of fetal abnormalities. While they do indicate an increased risk, only a very small number of women with a positive first trimester screen have babies who actually have a chromosome disorder.
In pregnancies where the fetus is carrying a chromosomal defect, such as the extra chromosome material that results in Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome, the levels of PAPP-A tend to be decreased, the levels of hCG are significantly increased, and the space at the fetus's neck is larger than normal.
While the first trimester screen can correctly identify approximately 85% of women carrying a fetus with Down syndrome and up to 75% of those with Edwards syndrome, about 5% to 10% of normal pregnancies will have a false-positive result.
If a screening test is positive, more definitive tests are needed to determine and confirm a diagnosis. These may include a diagnostic test such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in the first trimester or amniocentesis in the second trimester. While these two procedures are more accurate than screening tests, they are also invasive and carry a small risk of miscarriage and a rare risk of injury to the fetus.
Screening will not detect all cases of fetal abnormalities.



","



Test results are very dependent on nuchal translucency techniques and the accurate determination of the gestational age of the fetus. If the gestational age of the fetus has not been accurately determined, the results may be either falsely high or low.
In multiple gestation pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.), calculation of the risk of Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome can be difficult because the amount of PAPP-A and free beta hCG is increased. The nuchal translucency ultrasound, however, is an assessment that is unique to each fetus and can be done independently with ultrasound. A woman with a multiple gestation pregnancy should consult her healthcare practitioner about her options.



",,"



The first trimester screening is a combination of tests for PAPP-A, hCG and nuchal translucency that are used to assess the risk that the fetus a pregnant woman is carrying has a chromosome disorder such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18). The first trimester screen is one of the options you may be offered for prenatal Down syndrome screening. Other options include the second trimester maternal serum screen and the cell-free fetal DNA test.
One advantage of the first trimester screen is that it gives expecting women the option of earlier screening. However, the first trimester screen does not assess risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. This may be assessed in the second trimester as part of the maternal serum screen (triple or quad screen) or on its own.
The screening approach a woman may choose depends on what technology is available and when she first seeks prenatal care. For more information about how first trimester screening fits in with other screening options, see below.

To evaluate fertility issues, the health of your reproductive organs (ovaries or testicles), or pituitary function
In children, to evaluate early or delayed puberty


","

A blood sample is drawn by needle from a vein.


","



Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a hormone associated with reproduction and the development of eggs in women and sperm in men. This test measures FSH in the blood.
FSH is made by the pituitary gland, a small organ located in the center of the head behind the sinus cavity at the base of the brain. Control of FSH production is a complex system involving the hypothalamus in the brain, the pituitary gland, and the hormones produced by the ovaries or testicles. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary to release FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), a closely related hormone also involved in reproduction.

In women of childbearing age, FSH stimulates the growth and maturation of eggs (follicles) in the ovaries during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is divided into the follicular and the luteal phases, with each phase lasting about 14 days. During this follicular phase, FSH initiates the production of estradiol by the follicle, and the two hormones work together in the further development of the egg follicle. Near the end of the follicular phase, there is a surge of FSH and luteinizing hormone. Release of the egg from the ovary (ovulation) occurs shortly after this surge of hormones. The hormone inhibin as well as estradiol and progesterone help control the amount of FSH released by the pituitary gland. FSH also facilitates the ability of the ovary to respond to LH.

	As a woman ages and menopause approaches, ovarian function wanes and eventually ceases. As this occurs, FSH and LH levels rise.

In men, FSH stimulates the testicles to produce mature sperm and also promotes the production of androgen binding proteins. FSH levels are relatively constant in men after puberty. Less is known about FSH levels in aging men.
In infants and children, FSH levels rise shortly after birth and then fall to very low levels by 6 months in boys and 1-2 years in girls. Concentrations begin to rise again before the beginning of puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

Disorders affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, and/or the ovaries or testicles can cause the production of too much or too little FSH, resulting in a variety of conditions such as infertility, abnormal menstrual cycles, or early (precocious) or delayed puberty.

When your healthcare practitioner thinks that you have symptoms of a pituitary disorder or hypothalamic disorder
When a healthcare practitioner suspects that a child has delayed or earlier than expected puberty


","



For a woman, an FSH test may be ordered when she is having difficulty getting pregnant, has irregular or an absence of menstrual periods, or sometimes when it is suspected that she has entered menopause.
For a man, the test may be ordered when his partner cannot get pregnant, when he has a low sperm count, or when he has low muscle mass or decreased sex drive, for example.
In both women and men, testing may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a pituitary disorder is present. A pituitary disorder can affect the production of several different hormones, so there may be signs and symptoms in addition to some of those listed above. They can include fatigue, weakness, unexplained weight loss, and decreased appetite to name a few.
In children, FSH and LH may be ordered when a boy or girl does not appear to be entering puberty at an appropriate age (either too late or too soon). Signs of puberty may include:

Breast enlargement in girls
Growth of pubic hair
Growth of the testicles and penis in boys
Beginning of menstruation in girls




","



Results of an FSH test are typically considered with results of other hormone tests, such as LH , estrogens, and/or testosterone.
As part of an infertility workup, a high or low FSH is not diagnostic but provides a piece of information on what may be the cause. For example, a hormone imbalance may affect a woman's menstrual cycle and/or ovulation. A healthcare practitioner will consider all the information from the workup to establish a diagnosis.
In Women
FSH and LH levels can help to differentiate between a condition affecting the ovaries themselves (primary) and dysfunction of the ovaries due to disorders of either the pituitary or the hypothalamus (secondary).
High levels of FSH and LH are consistent with conditions affecting the ovaries themselves. Some examples include:
Developmental defects:

Failure to develop ovaries (ovarian agenesis)
Chromosome disorder, such as Turner syndrome
Defect in the steroid production by the ovaries, such as 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency

Damage to the ovaries due to:

Radiation exposure
Chemotherapy
Autoimmune disease 

Underlying conditions that affect ovary function, such as:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Adrenal disease
Thyroid disease 
Ovarian tumor

When a woman enters menopause and her ovaries stop working, FSH levels will rise.
Low levels of FSH and LH are consistent with a pituitary disorder or problem with the hypothalamus.
Low FSH serum levels have been associated with increased risk of ovarian cancer.
In Men
High FSH levels are due to conditions affecting the testicles themselves. Some examples include:

Viral infection (mumps)
Trauma, injury
Radiation exposure
Chemotherapy
Autoimmune disease
Germ cell tumor
Failure to develop normal gonads (gonadal agenesis)
Chromosome disorder, such as Klinefelter syndrome

Low levels are consistent with pituitary or hypothalamic disorders. See the article on Pituitary Disorders for more information.
In Children
Higher levels of FSH and LH than expected for age plus the development of secondary sexual characteristics at an unusually young age are an indication of early puberty. This is much more common in girls than in boys. This premature development is usually due to a problem with the central nervous system and can have a few different underlying causes. Examples include:

Central nervous system tumor
Brain injury, trauma
Inflammation within the central nervous system (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis)

Normal prepubescent levels of LH and FSH in children exhibiting some signs of puberty may indicate a condition called ""peripheral precocious puberty."" The signs and symptoms are brought on by elevated levels of the hormones estrogen or testosterone. This may be caused by:

Tumors that produce and release hormones
Adrenal gland tumors
Ovarian tumors or cysts
Testicular tumors

Normal FSH and LH levels with a few signs of puberty (e.g., development of pubic hair and acne) may signal a previous environmental exposure to agents, such as testosterone cream or gel, or may be a normal variation of puberty.
In delayed puberty, LH and FSH levels can be normal or below what is expected for a youth within this age range. Examples of some causes of delayed puberty include:

Dysfunction of the ovaries or testicles
Hormone deficiency
Turner syndrome
Klinefelter syndrome
Chronic infections
Cancer
Eating disorder (anorexia nervosa)




","



FSH results can be increased with use of certain drugs, including cimetidine, clomiphene, digitalis, and levodopa. FSH results can be falsely elevated in people who are taking large doses of biotin as this can interfere with immunoassays. FSH results can be decreased with oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, and hormone treatments. FSH will also be low when women are pregnant.



","



The test for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may be used with other hormone tests such as luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, estradiol, and/or progesterone to help:

Determine the cause of infertility 
Diagnose conditions associated with dysfunction of the ovaries or testicles
Aid in the diagnosis of pituitary or hypothalamus disorders, which can affect FSH production

In women, FSH levels are also useful in:

The investigation of menstrual irregularities
Predicting when or if a woman is entering menopause

In men, FSH levels are used to help determine the reason for a low sperm count.
In children, FSH and LH are used to help diagnose delayed or precocious (early) puberty. Irregular timing of puberty may be an indication of a more serious problem involving the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the ovaries or testicles, or other systems. The measurement of LH and FSH may differentiate between normal patterns of development and true disease. Once it is established that symptoms are a result of true disease, further testing can be done to identify the underlying cause.

","

To help monitor your blood glucose (sugar) levels over time if you have diabetes, especially if it is not possible to monitor your diabetes using the hemoglobin A1c test; to help determine the effectiveness of changes to your diabetic treatment plan that might include changes in diet, exercise or medications, especially if they were made recently


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein or sometimes from a fingerstick


","



Fructosamine is a compound that is formed when glucose combines with protein. This test measures the total amount of fructosamine (glycated protein) in the blood.
Glucose molecules will permanently combine with proteins in the blood in a process called glycation. These proteins include albumin, the principal protein in the fluid portion of blood (serum), as well as other serum proteins and hemoglobin, the major protein found inside red blood cells (RBCs). The more glucose that is present in the blood, the greater the amount of glycated proteins that are formed. These combined molecules persist for as long as the protein or RBC is present in the blood and provide a record of the average amount of glucose that has been present in the blood over that time period.
Since the lifespan of RBCs is about 120 days, glycated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c) represents a measurement of the average blood glucose level over the past 2 to 3 months. Serum proteins are present in the blood for a shorter time, about 14 to 21 days, so glycated proteins, and the fructosamine test, reflect average glucose levels over 2 to 3 weeks.
Keeping blood glucose levels as close as possible to normal helps individuals with diabetes to avoid many of the complications and progressive damage associated with elevated glucose levels. Good diabetic control is achieved and maintained by daily (or even more frequent) self-monitoring of glucose levels in people treated with insulin and by occasional monitoring of the effectiveness of treatment using the A1c test or the fructosamine test.

When you have diabetes and your healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate your average blood glucose level over the last 2-3 weeks


","



Although not widely used, the fructosamine test may be ordered whenever a healthcare practitioner wants to monitor a person's average glucose levels over the past 2 to 3 weeks. It is primarily ordered when a diabetic treatment plan is being started or adjusted in order to monitor the effect of the change in diet, exercise, or medication.
Fructosamine levels also may be ordered periodically when a diabetic woman who has diabetes is pregnant or when a person has an illness that may change their glucose and insulin requirements for a period of time. The fructosamine test may be used when monitoring is required and an A1c test cannot be reliably used, as in cases of a shortened RBC life span or in some cases where the person being tested has an abnormal hemoglobin.



","



A high fructosamine level means that the average blood glucose over the previous 2 to 3 weeks has been elevated. In general, the higher the fructosamine level, the higher the average blood glucose level. Monitoring the trend of values may be more important than a single high value. A trend from a normal to a high fructosamine level may indicate that glucose control is not adequate. This, however, does not pinpoint the cause. A review and adjustment to diet and/or medication may be required to help get glucose under control. Illness and significant stress can also temporarily raise blood glucose levels so these factors may also be taken into account when interpreting results.
A normal fructosamine level may indicate good glucose control and that the current treatment plan is effective for the individual. Likewise, a trend from high to normal fructosamine levels may indicate that changes to the treatment regimen have been effective.
Fructosamine results must be evaluated in the context of a person's overall clinical findings. Falsely low fructosamine results may be seen with decreased blood total protein and/or albumin levels, with conditions associated with increased protein loss in the urine or digestive tract, or with changes in the type of protein produced by the body. In this case, there may be a discrepancy between the results obtained from daily glucose monitoring and fructosamine testing. Also, someone whose glucose levels swing erratically from high to low may have normal or near normal fructosamine and A1c levels but still have a condition that requires frequent monitoring. However, most people with such unstable diabetic control do have elevated fructosamine and A1c concentrations. 



","



High levels of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and hyperthyroidism can interfere with test results.



","



Fructosamine testing may be used to help people with diabetes monitor and control their blood glucose levels in cases where the A1c test cannot be used and/or a shorter-term monitoring window is desired. The level of fructosamine in the blood is a reflection of glucose levels over the previous 2-3 weeks. (See the ""What is being tested?"" section for more on this.) However, what this translates to in regard to outcomes and prognosis is not as validated as with A1c.
The A1c test is much more well-known and widely accepted because there are firm data that a chronically elevated A1c level predicts an increased risk for certain diabetic complications, such as problems with the eyes (diabetic retinopathy), possibly leading to blindness, kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy), and nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy).
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recognizes the usefulness of monitoring glucose control and suggests more frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose or changing the timing of continuous glucose monitoring in situations where A1c cannot be reliably measured. The ADA states that the prognostic significance of the results of a fructosamine test are not as clear as with A1c.
Instances where fructosamine may be considered over A1c include:

Rapid changes in diabetes treatment – fructosamine allows the effectiveness of diet or medication adjustments to be evaluated after a few weeks rather than months.
Diabetic pregnancy – in women with diabetes who become pregnant, good glycemic control is essential during pregnancy, and the needs of the mother frequently change during the pregnancy; fructosamine measurements may be ordered along with glucose levels to help monitor and accommodate shifting glucose, insulin, or other medication requirements.
Shortened RBC life span – an A1c test will not be accurate when a person has a condition that affects the average lifespan of red blood cells (RBCs), such as hemolytic anemia or blood loss. When the lifespan of RBCs in circulation is shortened, the A1c result is falsely low and is an unreliable measurement of a person's average glucose over time.
Abnormal forms of hemoglobin – the presence of some hemoglobin variants, such as hemoglobin S in sickle cell anemia, may affect certain methods for measuring A1c. Furthermore, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) recommends against the use of the A1c test in patients with the hemoglobin variants HbSS, HbSC, or HbCC as these patients may suffer from conditions that affect the A1c test, such as anemia, increased RBC turn-over, and frequent blood transfusions.

To detect a fungal infection, to determine which specific fungus or fungi are present, and to help guide treatment

The sample collected depends upon the suspected location(s) of the infection. Some examples include: scrapings of the skin, nail and hair samples, body fluids, blood, and/or a tissue biopsy.

Fungi are microbes that exist in nature as one-celled yeasts or as branching filamentous molds (also may be spelled ""moulds""). Only about 20 to 25 species of fungi are common causes of infection. Fungal tests detect infections and sometimes identify the fungus and help guide treatment. 
Fungal infections range from superficial skin infections to serious deep tissue, blood, lung, or systemic diseases.

Superficial fungal infections are very common. They may cause nail infections or itchy, red, scaly skin infections such as those commonly known as athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm, or yeast infections that cause white patches in the mouth (thrush) or vaginal itching and discharge. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime.
Lung, blood, and systemic infections: less commonly, fungi cause serious lung infections, blood infections (septicemia), or systemic infections that can affect any organ in the body. Fungal lung infections typically start with the accidental inhalation of microscopic fungal spores. While anyone can get a serious lung or systemic fungal infection, most affected people will only experience mild to moderate flu-like symptoms. However, people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients, and people with an underlying condition such as diabetes or lung disease are at an increased risk of having a severe fungal infection, a systemic infection, and/or recurrent infections.

Fungal tests are used to detect and identify fungi in order to diagnose infections and help guide treatment. Fungal testing typically includes a microscopic examination of the sample on a slide, sometimes using a preparation or stain to aid in detection of fungal elements. This may be sufficient to determine that the infection is due to a fungus and, with superficial infections, no further testing may be required.
However, in cases of persistent, deep, or systemic infections when a more definitive diagnosis is needed, the microscopic exam may be followed by additional tests, such as culture and susceptibility testing, antigen or antibody tests, or molecular tests that detect fungal genetic material.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The sample collected depends upon the suspected location(s) of the infection. For superficial infections, the sample may include scrapings of the skin, clipped or shaved nail or hair, vaginal secretions collected with a swab, or a urine sample. For deeper tissue, organ, or systemic infections, the sample may involve the collection of urine, blood from a vein, sputum from the lungs, bone marrow, and/or the collection of a tissue biopsy. If meningitis is suspected, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is collected.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a skin, lung, or systemic fungal infection; sometimes after treatment to monitor its effectiveness


","



Fungal tests are ordered whenever a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person's signs and symptoms are due to a fungal infection. Many signs and symptoms of fungal infections are similar to those caused by bacteria and/or viruses, and fungal tests are often ordered when it is not clear what is causing the condition.
For superficial infections, tests may be ordered when symptoms involving skin, nails, or mucous membranes appear, for example:

Itchy, red, scaly areas of skin
Nails that are thickened, brittle, and/or deformed
White patches in the mouth (thrush)
Vaginal itching and discharge (yeast infection)

Deep and systemic fungal infections may cause a variety of symptoms depending on the part of the body that is affected. Some examples include:

Lung infections may produce flu-like symptoms such as coughing, fever, muscle aches, headaches, and rashes.
Blood infections (septicemia) may cause chills, fever, nausea, and rapid heartbeat.
Central nervous system (CNS) infections (meningitis) may cause severe persistent headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light.

Fungal tests may also be ordered after or periodically during treatment to evaluate its effectiveness or to monitor for infection recurrence.



","



Interpretation of fungal tests and examinations of slides and cultures often require experience in the study of fungi. Results must be carefully considered, along with signs and symptoms as well as medical history, and sometimes travel history, of the person tested.
Superficial Infections
Many superficial fungal infections are diagnosed based on a physical examination. In addition to general symptoms, many skin infections have characteristic signs (such as the appearance of infected nails) and typical locations on the body (such as athlete's foot between the toes). A clinical evaluation cannot, however, definitively tell the healthcare practitioner which microbe is causing a fungal infection. Sometimes a microscopic examination or culture of a sample may be useful in detecting and confirming a fungal infection and may help guide treatment.
Some examples of superficial infections include:

Yeast infections caused by Candida species
Athlete's foot
Jock itch
Scalp or hair infection
Finger or toenail infection
Ringworm

Deep Tissue, Lung, Blood, and Systemic Infections
In cases of persistent, deep, or systemic infections, a definitive diagnosis is needed and more extensive testing may be required to identify which fungus is causing the infection and to guide treatment. This usually involves a combination of several tests that may be performed on samples of sputum or tissue retrieved from the lungs, blood, urine, or spinal fluid. Examples of some serious fungal infections that may be require extensive testing include:

Aspergillosis
Blastomycosis
Coccidioidomycosis
Cryptococcosis
Histoplasmosis

For more on these, see the article on Fungal Infections.
In general, a negative test result means that there is no fungal infection present and symptoms are likely due to another cause. A negative test after a person has been treated for a fungal infection means that the therapy has been successful.
Positive results generally indicate that a fungus is present and sometimes identify the type causing an infection:

Microscopic examinations (KOH prep or Calcofluor white stain): in general, if fungal elements are seen, then a fungus is the likely the cause of symptoms. These tests, however, do not identify the fungus.
Culture: care must be taken when interpreting culture results. Interpretation often depends on the type of sample.
	
For non-sterile sites, such as the skin, a positive culture will typically identify the fungus or fungi present. The fungi identified may be the type that are disease-causing (pathogenic), the type that only cause disease in people with weakened immune systems (opportunistic), or those that are part of the normal flora. A mixture of these types may also be present.
Sterile samples, such as blood, CSF, or tissues that are properly collected will not be contaminated with normal flora. A positive culture identifies the fungus or fungi causing the infection.


A positive antigen test means that it is likely that the fungus tested is the cause of the person's infection.
A positive antibody test result in a single blood sample indicates exposure to a specific fungus, but it does not indicate whether the exposure was recent or in the past. On the other hand, a rise in the level of antibody (titer) between two serum samples collected 2-3 weeks apart (acute and convalescent) indicates an active or recent fungal infection.
Molecular tests: detection of a specific fungus with a molecular test indicates a likely infection with that fungus if the test was performed on a sample from a sterile body site, such as blood, CSF or tissue.




","



If a fungus that is causing an infection is not present in sufficient amount in a sample, a test to detect and/or identify the fungus may be falsely negative.
For antibody testing, some infected individuals with weakened immune systems may not produce antibodies as expected.
Fungal infections must frequently be distinguished from infections caused by other microbes, such as bacteria. In some cases, an infection may have both bacteria and fungi present. Tests that may be used to identify or rule out other causes include:

Gram stain – a rapid test performed to microscopically detect bacteria and/or fungi in a sample.
Bacterial culture – used to rule out a bacterial infection or determine if concurrent bacterial infection exists.
AFB testing – ordered when a mycobacterial infection such as tuberculosis is suspected.
Blood culture – ordered when septicemia is suspected.

Fungi thrive in moist environments, such as surfaces in and around public swimming pools and gym locker rooms, inside sweaty shoes and socks, in skin folds, and wherever skin is kept moist by constrictive clothing. Fungal skin infections can be minimized by wearing flip-flops or sandals when walking around the pool or locker room, by changing socks and underwear at least once a day, drying out shoes, and keeping moist areas of the body clean and dry.

Fungal tests are used to help detect and diagnose a fungal infection, to help guide treatment, and/or to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.

For many superficial skin and yeast infections, a clinical examination of the affected body part(s) and microscopic examination of the sample may be sufficient to determine that a fungal infection is present. The specific organism is not always identified. The healthcare practitioner has several topical and oral antifungal treatment options and bases the choice(s) on practice guidelines and experience.
For persistent, deeper, or systemic infections, several tests may be used for diagnosis and monitoring.
	
Fungal cultures are used to identify the specific fungi present. Many fungi are slow-growing, so it may take weeks for results. Susceptibility testing performed on fungi isolated from a culture is used to determine which antifungal is best to use for treatment.
Tests for fungal antigens and antibodies may be used to determine if an individual has, or recently had, a specific fungal infection. They are more rapid than fungal cultures but only test for a specific fungal species, so the healthcare practitioner has to know what fungal organism to test for. Many people have fungal antibodies from a prior exposure to the organism, so a single antibody test may not confirm the presence of a current infection. Sometimes, blood samples are collected 2 to 3 weeks apart (acute and convalescent samples) and tested to see if antibody levels (titers) are changing; the evaluation of these results may take several weeks.
Molecular tests may be performed to identify fungi grown in culture and sometimes may be used to detect a specific fungus directly in the sample collected. 



The following tables summarize uses of various fungal tests:

Generally, none; however, if symptoms are acute, it is advised that you wait to be tested for at least several weeks after the episode has resolved.


","

To determine whether you have an inherited G6PD deficiency


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm, by fingerstick, or by heelstick (newborns)


","



Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme involved in energy production. It is found in all cells, including red blood cells (RBCs) and helps protect them from certain toxic by-products of cellular metabolism. A deficiency in G6PD causes RBCs to become more vulnerable to breaking apart (hemolysis) under certain conditions. This test measures the amount of G6PD in RBCs to help diagnose a deficiency.
G6PD deficiency is a genetic disorder. When individuals who have inherited this condition are exposed to a trigger such as stress, an infection, certain drugs or other substance(s), significant changes occur in the structure of the outer layer (cell membrane) of their red blood cells. Hemoglobin, the life-sustaining, oxygen-transporting protein within RBCs, forms deposits (precipitates) called Heinz bodies. Some individuals may experience these reactions when exposed to fava beans, a condition called ""favism."" With these changes, RBCs can break apart more readily, causing a decrease in the number of RBCs. When the body cannot produce sufficient RBCs to replace those destroyed, hemolytic anemia results and the individual may develop jaundice, weakness, fatigue, and/or shortness of breath.
G6PD deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency in the world, affecting more than 400 million people. It may be seen in up to 10% of African-American males and 20% of African males. It is also commonly found in people from the Mediterranean and Southeast Asia.
G6PD deficiency is inherited, passed from parent to child, due to mutations or changes in the G6PD gene that cause decreased enzyme activity. There are over 440 variants of G6PD deficiency. The G6PD gene is located on the sex-linked X chromosome. Since men have one X and one Y sex chromosome, their single X chromosome carries the G6PD gene. This may result in a G6PD deficiency if a male inherits the single X chromosome with an altered gene.
Since women have two X sex chromosomes, they inherit two copies of the G6PD gene. Women with only one mutated gene (heterozygous) produce enough G6PD that they usually do not experience any symptoms (i.e., asymptomatic), but under situations of stress, they may demonstrate a mild form of the deficiency. In addition, a mother may pass the single mutated gene to any male children. Rarely do women have two mutated gene copies (homozygous), which could result in G6PD deficiency.
G6PD deficiency is a common cause of persistent jaundice in newborns. If left untreated, this can lead to significant brain damage and mental retardation.
Most people with G6PD deficiency can lead fairly normal lives, but there is no specific treatment apart from prevention. They must be cautious and avoid certain medications such as aspirin, phenazopyridine and rasburicase, antibiotics with ""sulf"" in the name and dapsone, anti-malarial drugs with ""quine"" in the name, foods such as fava beans, and chemical substances such as naphthalene (found in moth balls). Note that fava beans, often called broad beans, are commonly grown in the Mediterranean area. Acute viral and bacterial infections can also initiate episodes of hemolytic anemia as well as elevated levels of acid in the blood (i.e., acidosis). Individuals should consult with their healthcare practitioner to get a comprehensive list of these triggers. A good starting point is the list found on the G6PD Deficiency Favism Association website.
With hemolytic anemia, RBCs are destroyed at an accelerated rate and the person affected becomes pale and fatigued (anemic) as their capacity for providing oxygen to their body decreases. In severe cases of RBC destruction, jaundice can also be present. Most of these episodes are self-limiting, but if a large number of RBCs are destroyed and the body cannot replace them fast enough, then the affected person may require a blood transfusion. This condition can be fatal if not treated. A small percentage of those affected with G6PD deficiency may experience chronic anemia.

When a child experienced persistent jaundice as a newborn for unknown reasons; when you have had one or more intermittent bouts of hemolytic anemia that may be triggered by an infection or certain medications


","



G6PD enzyme testing is primarily performed when an individual has signs and symptoms associated with hemolytic anemia. Testing may be done when someone has had an episode of increased RBC destruction but after the crisis has resolved. Some signs and symptoms include:

Fatigue, weakness
Pale skin (pallor)
Fainting
Shortness of breath
A rapid heart rate
Jaundice
Red or brown urine (from the presence of blood/hemoglobin)
Enlarged spleen

Testing may also be done when other laboratory test results are consistent with a hemolytic anemia. These may show increased bilirubin concentrations (bulirubinemia), hemoglobin in the urine (hemoglobinuria), decreased RBC count and haptoglobin levels, increased reticulocyte count and lactate dehydrogenase levels, presence of bite cells on a blood smear, and sometimes the presence of Heinz bodies inside the RBCs on a specially stained blood smear.
G6PD activity testing is typically ordered when other causes of anemia and jaundice have been ruled out and several weeks after an acute incident has been resolved.
If available, screening may be performed on a newborn in the first day or two after birth.



","



A low level of G6PD enzyme indicates a deficiency. An affected person is more likely to experience symptoms when exposed to a trigger. The results, however, cannot be used to predict how an affected person will react in a given set of circumstances. The severity of symptoms will vary from person to person and from episode to episode.
A normal G6PD enzyme level in a male indicates that it is unlikely he has a deficiency, and if anemia is present, it is likely due to another cause. However, if the test was performed during an episode of hemolytic anemia, it should be repeated several weeks later when the RBC population has had time to replenish and mature.
Women who are carriers, having one mutated and one normal gene copy (heterozygous), will have some RBCs that are G6PD-deficient and some that are not. These women will usually have normal or near normal G6PD levels and rarely experience symptoms. A carrier will have a normal or low normal G6PD level, thus may not be identified through G6PD screening but would be detected in a G6PD confirmation test that quantitates the overall amount of enzyme present in the cells. Note that rare female who has two mutated gene copies (homozygous) will likely show a significant decrease in G6PD level.



","



While G6PD deficiency is found throughout the world, it is most common in those of African, Mediterranean, and Southeast Asian descent. Its geographical area of increased prevalence mirrors that of malaria. Many researchers think that G6PD deficiency may have offered a survival advantage to those infected with malaria, a parasite that infects the red blood cells (RBCs). Generally, the G6PD deficiencies associated with the Mediterranean region are the most dangerous.
Certain laboratory methods, biochemical testing, and electrophoresis can be used to distinguish between different G6PD enzyme variants. This has been used in the past to study the prevalence and levels of different types of the enzymes, both normal and deficient, but this testing is used almost exclusively in the research setting.
G6PD testing should not be done soon after a blood transfusion as the donor RBCs can mask a G6PD deficiency.



",,"



Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme testing is used to screen for and help diagnose G6PD deficiencies. It may be used to screen children who had unexplained persistent jaundice as a newborn. Currently, newborns are not routinely screened for G6PD deficiency; however, this is dependent upon the specific state that provides the testing. According to the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center, as of November 2014, two states provide G6PD testing as part of their newborn screening panel: Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia.
G6PD testing may also be used to help establish a diagnosis for people of any age who have had unexplained episodes of hemolytic anemia, jaundice, or dark urine. If the person had a recent viral or bacterial illness or was exposed to a known trigger (such as fava beans, a ""sulfa"" drug, or naphthalene), followed by a hemolytic episode, then G6PD deficiency may be considered.
Repeat G6PD testing may occasionally be ordered to confirm initial findings. Screening tests typically involve a simple qualitative test that only tells if the person has a certain high level of G6PD in his or her cells. Confirmation testing will involve a quantitative test, with which the actual amount of enzyme activity is measured.
In the most common form of G6PD deficiency seen in persons of African ancestry, G6PD levels are normal in newly produced cells but decrease up to 75% as the RBCs age. Because of this, testing is not recommended until several weeks after a hemolytic episode resolves. During the episode, a higher percentage of the older, more fragile G6PD-deficient RBCs are typically destroyed, leaving the newer, less deficient cells to be tested, potentially masking a G6PD deficiency.
Genetic testing is not routinely done but can be ordered as follow up to an enzyme test(s) that indicates a deficiency to determine which G6PD mutation(s) are present. At this time, more than 440 G6PD gene variations have been identified and can cause deficiencies of varying severity depending on the mutation(s) and on the individual person. Some mutations do not change the G6PD enzyme activity. The World Health Organization has classified the G6PD mutations into five groups based on the enzyme levels and their impact on the affected person’s health. However, only the most common G6PD mutations are identified during testing. If a specific mutation is known to be present in a family line, tests to detect that particular mutation can also be conducted. Several facilities that offer this unique testing are provided on the site Genetic Testing Registry.

gamma-glutamyl-transferase-ggt,"['GGT', 'Gamma-Glutamyl Transpeptidase', 'GGTP', 'Gamma-GT', 'GTP']","

GGT levels fall after meals; you may be instructed to fast (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 8 hours prior to the test. You may also be asked to stop drinking alcohol or taking certain prescription medications.

To evaluate for a possible liver disease or bile duct disease or to differentiate between liver and bone disease as a cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP); sometimes to screen for or monitor alcohol abuse


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme that is found in many organs throughout the body, with the highest concentrations found in the liver. GGT is elevated in the blood in most diseases that cause damage to the liver or bile ducts. This test measures the level of GGT in a blood sample.
Normally, GGT is present in low levels, but when the liver is injured, the GGT level can rise. GGT is usually the first liver enzyme to rise in the blood when any of the bile ducts that carry bile from the liver to the intestines become obstructed, for example, by tumors or stones. This makes it the most sensitive liver enzyme test for detecting bile duct problems.
However, the GGT test is not very specific and is not useful in differentiating between various causes of liver damage because it can be elevated with many types of liver diseases, such as liver cancer and viral hepatitis, as well as other non-hepatic conditions, such as acute coronary syndrome. For this reason, the GGT test is not recommended for routine use by itself. However, it can be useful in conjunction with other tests and in determining the cause of a high alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, another enzyme found in the liver.
Both GGT and ALP are increased in liver diseases, but only ALP will be increased with diseases affecting bone tissue. Therefore, GGT can be used as a follow up to an elevated ALP to help determine if the high ALP result is due to liver or bone disease.
GGT levels are sometimes increased with consumption of even small amounts of alcohol. Higher levels are found more commonly in chronic heavy drinkers than in people who consume less than 2 to 3 drinks per day or who only drink heavily on occasion (binge drinkers). The GGT test may be used in evaluating someone for acute or chronic alcohol abuse.

When you have symptoms of a liver or bile duct disorder or as follow up when you have an increased ALP level


","



A GGT test may be ordered when you have an elevated ALP level. An ALP test may be ordered alone or as part of a routine liver panel to screen for liver damage, even if no symptoms are present. A GGT test may be ordered when results of the ALP test are high but other tests that are part of the liver panel (such as AST and ALT) are not increased.
GGT may be ordered along with or as a follow up to other liver function tests when you have signs or symptoms that suggest liver disease, such as:

Weakness, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Abdominal swelling and/or pain
Jaundice
Dark urine, light-colored stool
Itching (pruritus)

GGT may also be ordered when someone with a history of alcohol abuse has completed alcohol treatment in order to monitor compliance with the treatment program.



","



Results of the GGT are interpreted along with ALP results and with other tests results that may have been performed at the same time, such as a liver panel.
An elevated ALP with a high GGT level helps rule out bone disease as the cause of the increased ALP level. An elevated ALP with a low or normal GGT means the increased ALP is more likely due to bone disease.
An elevated GGT level suggests that a condition or disease is damaging the liver but does not indicate specifically the cause of the damage. In general, the higher the level, the greater the damage to the liver. Elevated levels may be due to liver diseases, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis, but they may also be due to other conditions, such as congestive heart failure, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, or pancreatitis. They may also be caused by alcohol abuse, alcoholic liver disease, or use of drugs that are toxic to the liver.
A low or normal GGT test result indicates that it is unlikely that you have liver disease or have consumed any alcohol.



","



Even small amounts of alcohol within 24 hours of a GGT test may cause a temporary increase in the GGT. However, genetic variability between individuals can cause differences in this response of GGT to alcohol use. Smoking can also increase GGT.
Elevated GGT levels may be an indicator of cardiovascular disease and/or hypertension. Some studies have shown that people with increased GGT levels have an elevated risk of dying from heart disease, but the reason for this association is not yet known.
Low levels of GGT are observed in certain genetic diseases where the flow of bile from liver is interrupted or suppressed.
Drugs that may cause an elevated GGT level include phenytoin, carbamazepine, and barbiturates such as phenobarbital. Use of many other prescription and non-prescription drugs, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), lipid-lowering drugs, antibiotics, histamine receptor blockers (used to treat excess stomach acid production), antifungal agents, antidepressants, oral contraceptives and hormones such as testosterone, can increase GGT levels. Certain anticoagulants (e.g., heparin) and immunosuppressive medications (e.g., methotrexate) also increase GGT levels in serum.
Levels of GGT increase with age in women, but not in men, and are always somewhat higher in men than in women.



","



The gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) test may be used to determine the cause of elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Both ALP and GGT are elevated in disease of the bile ducts and in some liver diseases, but only ALP will be elevated in bone disease. Therefore, if the GGT level is normal in a person with a high ALP, the cause of the elevated ALP is most likely bone disease.
The GGT test is sometimes used to help detect liver disease and bile duct obstructions. It is usually ordered in conjunction with or as follow up to other liver tests such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALP, and bilirubin. (Read also about the Liver Panel.) In general, an increased GGT level indicates that the liver is being damaged but does not specifically point to a condition that may be causing the injury.
GGT can be used to screen for chronic alcohol abuse (it will be elevated in about 75% of chronic drinkers) and to monitor for alcohol use and/or abuse in people who are receiving treatment for alcoholism or alcoholic hepatitis.

gastrin,,"

You should fast for 12 hours, including avoiding coffee and caffeine-containing drinks, and avoid alcohol for 24 hours prior to the test. Your healthcare practitioner may also ask you to refrain from taking certain stomach medications for several days prior to the test. Medications that can increase gastrin levels include antacids, H2-blocking agents (such as cimetidine), and proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole).


","

To determine whether you are producing too much gastrin; to help diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and gastrin-producing tumors (gastrinomas) or G-cell hyperplasia; to monitor for recurrence of a gastrinoma


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Gastrin is a hormone produced by ""G-cells"" in the part of the stomach called the antrum. It regulates the production of acid in the body of the stomach during the digestive process. This test measures the amount of gastrin in the blood to help evaluate an individual with recurrent peptic ulcers and/or other serious abdominal symptoms.
When food is eaten, the antrum of the stomach becomes distended and the presence of food stimulates the release of gastrin. Gastrin in turn stimulates parietal cells to produce gastric acid. Acidity helps to digest food and the rise in acidity eventually suppresses gastrin release. This feedback system normally results in low concentrations of gastrin in the blood, especially in the fasting state. Rare conditions such as G-cell hyperplasia and gastrinomas, including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome, can cause an overproduction of gastrin and gastric acid. This can lead to aggressive peptic ulcers that can be difficult to treat.
Gastrinomas are gastrin-producing tumors. ZE syndrome is a condition caused by the presence of one or more gastrinomas and is characterized by high gastrin levels, greatly increased gastric acid production, and by peptic ulcers. Gastrinomas usually form in the pancreas, even though the endocrine cells of the pancreas do not normally make gastrin. More than half of them are malignant, causing cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver. Even tiny tumors can produce large quantities of gastrin.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
You should fast for 12 hours and avoid alcohol for 24 hours prior to the test. Your healthcare practitioner may also ask you to refrain from taking certain stomach medications for several days prior to the test. Medications that can increase gastrin levels include antacids, H2-blocking agents (such as cimetidine), and proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole). These prevent the normal negative feedback in which acidity suppresses gastrin production.

When you have peptic ulcers and/or diarrhea and abdominal pain that your healthcare practitioner suspects is caused by excess gastrin; periodically to monitor for a gastrinoma recurrence


","



A gastrin test may be ordered when a person has diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or recurrent peptic ulcers that do not respond to treatment and that the healthcare practitioner suspects are due to excess gastrin production. A gastrin stimulation test may be ordered when a gastrin level is moderately elevated and the healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a gastrinoma.
When a gastrin-producing tumor has been removed, a gastrin test may be ordered periodically as a screening test to monitor for recurrence.



","



Low or normal blood levels of gastrin are not typically of concern.
Moderately increased levels may be seen with a variety of conditions such as ZE syndrome, G-cell hyperplasia, chronic atrophic gastritis (a condition resulting from long-term inflammation of the stomach lining that leads to the loss of acid-producing cells), pernicious anemia, a pyloric obstruction (blockage at the junction of the stomach and duodenum), and chronic kidney failure.
Greatly increased levels of gastrin in symptomatic individuals and concentrations of gastrin that increase significantly during a gastrin stimulation test indicate the likelihood that a person has ZE syndrome and one or more gastrinomas. Imaging tests may be ordered as a follow up to high gastrin concentrations to locate the gastrinoma(s). The quantity of gastrin produced is not related to either the tumor size or to the number of tumors. Even tiny tumors can produce large amounts of gastrin.
Gastrin levels that were initially low after the surgical removal of a gastrinoma and then increase may signal a recurrence of the tumor. Concentrations that do not decrease after treatment may indicate that the treatment has not been fully effective.



","



Gastrinomas can affect anyone, but people who have an inherited condition called MEN-1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, type 1) are at an increased risk. These people have genetic alterations that increase their lifetime risk of developing tumors in their pancreas or in another of their endocrine glands.
It is important to note that most stomach ulcers are not due to gastrinomas. They are commonly associated with Helicobacter pylori infections and sometimes with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen.
Gastrin levels commonly increase with age and with prolonged use of medications such as antacids and proton pump inhibitors that neutralize or inhibit the production of stomach acid. They will also typically be elevated in people who are not fasting. Increases in gastrin concentration with age may reflect a general decrease in the ability to produce stomach acid.
Gastrin blood levels follow a circadian rhythm. This means that they will be at their lowest between about 3 to 7 AM. Concentrations will be higher during the day and will fluctuate in response to meals.

The gastrin test is primarily used to help detect excess production of gastrin and gastric acid. It is used to help diagnose gastrin-producing tumors called gastrinomas, Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome, and hyperplasia of G-cells. G-cells are specialized cells in the stomach that produce gastrin, which in turn increases the production of gastric acid.
A gastrin test may also be used to monitor for recurrence following the surgical removal of a gastrinoma.
A gastrin stimulation test therefore may be used to provide additional information if the initial gastrin test result is moderately but not significantly elevated and the healthcare practitioner suspects that a person's symptoms are due to a gastrinoma. This procedure involves collecting a baseline gastrin sample, giving the patient a chemical (typically the hormone secretin) to stimulate gastrin production, and then collecting additional blood samples at timed intervals for gastrin testing. The other (benign) causes of elevated gastrin will not show an increase after secretin administration.
A measurement of gastric acid pH level may sometimes be ordered along with or following a gastrin test to help diagnose ZE syndrome.

A variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites can cause infections of the digestive system (gastrointestinal (GI) infections). The gastrointestinal pathogen panel simultaneously tests for the presence of multiple disease-causing (pathogenic) microbes in a stool sample.
The GI pathogen panel detects the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of some of the more common pathogens. It can identify co-infections (more than one microbe causing infection) and identify microbes that might be missed with traditional testing. Results of a GI pathogen panel may be available within a few hours, compared to a few days with some traditional testing.
GI infections are often caused by ingesting food or fluid that has been contaminated by bacteria, viruses or, more rarely, parasites. Examples of contaminated sources include raw or undercooked eggs, poultry or beef, unpasteurized milk, and untreated water from lakes, streams, and (occasionally) from community water supplies. (For more, read Food and Waterborne Illness.)
Microbes causing an infection are shed into (present in) the stool of infected people. Because of this, infections can spread to other people through exposure to infected stool. If people with GI infections don't wash their hands well after using the bathroom, they can spread the infection when others come into contact with surfaces that an infected person has touched, such as door knobs or hand rails. Individuals with diarrheal illness should avoid preparing food for others whenever possible.
Some GI infections are caused by the overgrowth of the bacterium Clostridium difficile. This can cause a decrease in the normally protective ""good bacteria"" (normal flora) in the lower intestines. This may occur, for example, when treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to the suppression of normal flora and the growth of antibiotic-resistant C. difficile.
While a wide variety of viruses, bacteria, and parasites can cause GI infections, the list of common ones is much smaller. A healthcare practitioner may have an idea about the cause based upon a person's recent food and drink, medical history, and/or recent travel but will not be able to positively identify the microbe without testing.
If a person's illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, the healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in the stool, or if it is continuing unabated, then a GI pathogen panel may be ordered. Diarrhea can be sometimes be serious if not diagnosed and treated. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diarrhea is a global killer. It is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 worldwide, killing an estimated 2,195 children a day.
Testing may be also be done if the person has been outside the U.S. and/or has eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to them ill. The CDC estimates that 30% to 70% of those who travel outside of the U.S. will get a GI infection.
Traditional testing has included a stool culture to identify pathogenic bacteria, an ova and parasite test (O&P) exam to identify parasites, and/or multiple other tests – such as antigen tests. These tests are useful, but some bacteria can be hard to grow successfully in culture, some parasites can be missed if present in low numbers, and testing for viruses is not routinely available. Many tests are also labor-intensive, and it may take 2-3 days or more before a healthcare practitioner has a definitive answer.
If a person has a GI infection caused by a less common bacterium, parasite, or virus not included in the GI pathogen panel, then it will not be detected. Additional tests, such as a stool culture or O&P exam, may be required to help establish a diagnosis.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A fresh stool sample is collected in a clean container. The stool sample should not be contaminated with urine or water. Once it has been collected, the stool should be taken to the laboratory within two hours after collection or should be transferred into a vial containing a preservative and taken to the lab as soon as possible.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea and/or vomiting; when you have blood or mucus in your loose stools


","



GI panels may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms associated with a digestive system infection. These may include:

Diarrhea with frequent, loose stools
Blood and/or mucus in the stool in some cases
Stomach (abdominal) pain and cramping
Nausea and vomiting
Fever

Not everyone who has these symptoms will necessarily have testing done or be treated. In people with healthy immune systems, these infections often resolve with supportive care and without treatment. A GI pathogen panel is more likely to be ordered when a person:

Has severe symptoms, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and other complications
Is very young, elderly, or has a weakened immune system
Has prolonged signs and symptoms and/or infections that do not resolve without treatment
Has an illness during and following travel outside the U.S, especially to emerging nations
Is ill and a possible outbreak of food or waterborne illness prompts the medical community to investigate and identify the cause; examples include contaminated produce, contaminated food from a specific restaurant, and/or illness on a cruise ship.




","



Results are typically interpreted in conjunction with a person's signs and symptoms, medical history, and travel history.
A positive result means that the microbe detected and identified is likely causing the signs and symptoms. If more than one result is positive, the person may be infected with more than one microbe (co-infection). The following are some exceptions:

Sometimes, a positive result reflects the presence of bacteria that are present in (colonize) a person's digestive system but do not cause illness.
The panels detect the presence of genetic material of the microbes and do not distinguish between dead and living ones. Sometimes, a positive result reflects the presence of dead microbes that are not the cause of infection.
Rarely, a result may be positive when the microbe is not present or may show positive as a different organism because of genetic similarities.

A negative result means that the microbes tested were not detected and the person’s signs and symptoms may be caused by a condition other than an infection or a pathogen that was not tested for. The following are some exceptions:

When a person has a GI infection caused by a less common bacterium, parasite, or virus not included in the panel, then it will not be detected.
Microbes are shed into the stool intermittently. A negative result may mean that the microbe causing the person’s infection was not present in the stool at the time the sample was collected.
Rarely, a person may have a GI infection caused by one of the microbes, but the test does not detect it. The bacteria, virus, or parasite genetic material may be present in very small quantities in the stool sample.

If results are negative and symptoms persist and/or if suspicion of an infection remains high, then other tests may be done to help establish a diagnosis:

A GI pathogens panel only detects a few of the common parasites. An O&P exam may need to be performed as a follow-up test if a parasite that is not on the panel is suspected. Less common parasites are more frequently encountered when someone has traveled outside of the U.S. but are also found within the U.S.
A stool culture may be done as a follow-up test to detect bacteria that are not included in the panel.

To read more about the microbes that can cause GI infections, see the articles on Food and Waterborne Illness, Diarrhea, and Travelers' Diseases.



","



Unlike the stool culture, GI panels do not grow bacteria so there will not be live bacteria available to perform susceptibility testing on to help guide antimicrobial selection. If susceptibility testing is needed, then the bacteria will also need to be cultured.
When a healthcare practitioner has a strong suspicion as to the cause of an infection, then a test for a specific microbe may be ordered instead of a panel. Examples include:

A person has drunk water from a stream while camping and is likely to be infected with Giardia. A Giardia antigen test may be performed.
Someone recently completed treatment that involved a broad-spectrum antimicrobial and is likely to have a Clostridium difficile infection. A Clostridium difficile toxin or PCR test may be performed.




",,"



Gastrointestinal (GI) pathogen panels are used to simultaneously test for the presence of multiple disease-causing (pathogenic) viruses, bacteria, and/or parasites in a stool sample and help diagnose an infection of the digestive system (GI tract). Since there are many causes of GI infections, a GI pathogen panel may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a stool culture or an ova and parasite exam (O&P), to help establish a diagnosis.
The GI pathogen panel detects the genetic material (DNA, RNA) of the microbes that are tested. The number and type of microbes tested depend on the composition of the panel used. While some panels may be limited to testing for a few bacteria that are the most common causes of GI infections, for example, other panels may be more comprehensive and test for a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites.
Examples of some of the microbes that might be tested include:

Viruses, such as norovirus or adenovirus
Bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Salmonella or Clostridium difficile
Parasites, such as Giardia or Cryptosporidium

Many GI infections in the U.S. resolve with no specific treatment, with only supportive care, and may not require testing. In otherwise healthy individuals, the infections are considered common illnesses that are not serious and sometimes thought of as ""food poisoning"" or ""stomach flu."" However, there are cases where it is useful to perform testing that identifies the cause of the GI infection – to guide its treatment, eliminate its source, and limit its spread.
The panels may identify the presence of microbes that a healthcare practitioner might not otherwise suspect and identify co-infections (more than one cause for the infection). This allows treatment (when needed) to be better targeted and to begin sooner. Results of testing may be available within a few hours.
Since the GI panels are relatively new, laboratories and healthcare providers are still in the process of determining how to use them to provide the optimum patient results while being cost-effective. Additional tests, such as stool culture and O&P, may be done if a microbe is not identified by the panel and/or if there is a suspicion of a microbe other than those included in the GI panel.
GI panels are not used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Once the specific microbe(s) causing the infection has been identified, a test that is specific for the microbe(s) would be used instead of a GI panel to determine whether treatment has cured the infection. This may be done, for example, when there is an outbreak of foodborne illness. Food handlers would have follow-up testing to ensure that they are no longer shedding the pathogen and will not spread it to others.

Screening and diagnosis: in general, it is recommended that you fast (nothing to eat or drink except water) for at least 8 hours (usually overnight) before having a blood glucose test. Sometimes testing may be done at a random time when you have not fasted. For example, glucose testing may be done as part of routine screening during a general health exam.
For people with diabetes, glucose levels are often checked both while fasting and after meals to provide the best control of diabetes. For random, timed, and post-meal glucose tests, follow your health practitioner's instructions.

Screening and diagnosis: a blood sample drawn from a vein; note that blood samples from fingersticks are not appropriate for diagnosing diabetes.
Monitoring: a drop of blood from a fingerstick is tested using a home glucose monitor (glucometer). Some people with diabetes may use a continuous glucose monitoring device, which uses a small sensor wire inserted beneath the skin to measure blood glucose at frequent intervals.



","



Glucose (commonly called ""blood sugar"") is the primary energy source for the body's cells and the only short-term energy source for the brain and nervous system. A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. Glucose tests measure the level of glucose in your blood or detect glucose in your urine.
A few different protocols may be used to evaluate glucose levels. This article focuses on:

Fasting blood glucose (commonly called fasting blood sugar)—this test measures the level after a fast of at least 8 hours.
Random blood glucose—sometimes your blood glucose will be measured when you have not fasted (randomly).

Other types of glucose tests include:

A glucose tolerance test measures glucose levels after fasting and after you drink liquid containing a specific amount of glucose (see Glucose Tolerance Test).
A specific protocol is used to help diagnose gestational diabetes, which is diabetes that first develops during pregnancy (see Glucose Tests for Gestational Diabetes).
Urine is routinely tested for glucose as part of a urinalysis.

During digestion, the carbohydrates that you eat are broken down into glucose (and other nutrients). They are absorbed by the digestive tract, move into the blood, and circulate throughout the body. Normally, blood glucose rises slightly after a meal and the hormone insulin is released by the pancreas into the blood in response. The amount of insulin released corresponds to the size and content of the meal. Insulin helps transport glucose into the body's cells, where it is used for energy. As glucose moves into the cells and is broken down (metabolized), the blood glucose level drops and the pancreas responds by decreasing the release of insulin.
If this glucose/insulin blood feedback system is working properly, the amount of glucose in the blood remains fairly stable. If the feedback system is disrupted and the glucose level in the blood rises, then the body tries to restore the balance by increasing insulin production.
Diabetes is the most common disease resulting from an imbalance between glucose and insulin.

Type 1 diabetes results when the body is not able to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels. Usually in type 1 diabetes, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells) have been destroyed by the person's own immune system.
Type 2 diabetes results from a combination of insulin resistance (the body does not react normally to insulin) and a relative decline in insulin production.
Some women may develop gestational diabetes, which is high blood glucose that develops during pregnancy. (For more information, see the article on Glucose Tests for Gestational Diabetes.)

Severe, acute changes in blood glucose, either high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia), can be life-threatening, causing organ failure, brain damage, coma, and, in some cases, death. Chronically high blood glucose levels that can occur with untreated or poorly controlled diabetes can cause progressive damage to body organs such as the kidneys, eyes, heart and blood vessels, and nerves. Chronic hypoglycemia can lead to brain and nerve damage.

When you have symptoms suggesting high or low blood glucose
When you have diabetes, you may be instructed by your healthcare practitioner to check your glucose level up to several times a day.

Screening and Diagnosis
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends diabetes screening when you are age 45 or older. Several health organizations, including the ADA, recommend screening when you have risk factors, regardless of age. You may be at risk if you:

Are overweight, obese, or physically inactive
Have a close relative with diabetes, such as parent, siblings, aunt or uncle
Are a woman who delivered a baby weighing more than 9 pounds or who has a history of gestational diabetes
A woman with polycystic ovary syndrome
Are of a high-risk race or ethnicity, such as African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander
Have high blood pressure (hypertension) (≥140/90 mmHg) or are taking medication for high blood pressure
Have a low HDL cholesterol level (less than 35 mg/dL or 0.90 mmol/L) and/or a high triglyceride level
Have prediabetes identified by previous testing
Have a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD)

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for abnormal blood glucose as part of a risk assessment for cardiovascular disease in adults ages 40 to 70 who are overweight or obese.
If the screening test result is within normal limits, the ADA and USPSTF recommend rescreening every 3 years. People with prediabetes may be monitored with annual testing.
A blood glucose test may also be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of abnormal blood glucose levels.
High blood glucose (hyperglycemia):

Increased thirst, usually with frequent urination
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Slow-healing wounds or infections

Low blood glucose (hypoglycemia):

Sweating
Hunger
Trembling
Anxiety
Confusion
Blurred vision

Monitoring
If you have diabetes, you may be instructed to self-check your glucose levels up to several times a day. Your healthcare practitioner may order blood glucose levels periodically in conjunction with other tests such as hemoglobin A1c to monitor glucose control over time.



","



Screening and Diagnosis
High levels of glucose most frequently indicate diabetes, but many other diseases and conditions can also cause elevated blood glucose.
A random glucose level (non-fasting) in a person with signs and symptoms of diabetes and hyperglycemia that is equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) indicates diabetes.
The following table summarizes the meaning of fasting glucose results.
Fasting Blood Glucose



Glucose Level
Indication




From 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.5 mmol/L)
Normal fasting glucose


From 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/L)
Prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose)


126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) and above on more than one testing occasion
Diabetes



Some other diseases and conditions that can result in an elevated blood glucose level include:

Acromegaly
Acute stress (response to trauma, heart attack, and stroke for instance)
Chronic kidney disease
Cushing syndrome
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
Pancreatic cancer
Pancreatitis

A low level of glucose may indicate hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by a drop in blood glucose to a level where first it causes nervous system symptoms (sweating, palpitations, hunger, trembling, and anxiety), then begins to affect the brain (causing confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, and sometimes even coma and death). A diagnosis of hypoglycemia uses three criteria known as the Whipple triad. (See ""How is hypoglycemia diagnosed?"" below.) 
A low blood glucose level (hypoglycemia) may be seen with:

Adrenal insufficiency
Drinking excessive alcohol
Severe liver disease
Hypopituitarism
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Severe infections
Severe heart failure
Chronic kidney (renal) failure
Insulin overdose
Tumors that produce insulin (insulinomas)
Starvation
Deliberate use of glucose-lowering products

Monitoring
If you have diabetes and are monitoring your glucose levels, your healthcare practitioner will give you guidelines for how high or low your blood sugar should be at different times of the day. This may depend on several factors, such as:

How long you have had diabetes
Your age and life expectancy
Other underlying conditions you may have, including heart disease
Whether you do not experience distinct symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia unawareness)

Screening and Diagnosis

Fasting blood glucose (FBG)—this test may be used to screen for and diagnose prediabetes and diabetes in people with signs and symptoms. In some cases, there may be no early signs or symptoms of diabetes, so an FBG may be used to screen people at risk of diabetes. Screening can be useful in helping to identify it and allowing for treatment before the condition worsens or complications arise. If the initial screening result is abnormal, the test should be repeated. The repeat result must also be abnormal to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. Certain other tests (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) can also be used to confirm diagnosis of diabetes.
Random blood glucose—sometimes a blood sample may be drawn and glucose measured when you have not fasted, for example, when a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or basic metabolic panel (BMP) is performed. A random blood glucose may also be used to screen for diabetes. However, if a random glucose result is abnormal, it is typically followed by a fasting blood glucose test or a glucose tolerance test (GTT) to establish the diagnosis.

Monitoring
Some people with diabetes must monitor their own blood glucose levels, often several times a day, to determine how far above or below normal their glucose is and to determine what medications or insulin(s) they may need. Glucose monitoring may be done by inserting a glucose test strip into a small instrument called a glucose meter. A drop of blood from a skin prick is placed onto the test strip and the glucose meter provides a digital readout of the blood glucose level. Alternatively, some people may use a continuous glucose monitoring device.

Glucose is the primary energy source for the body's cells and the only energy source for the brain and nervous system. A steady supply must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood. Glucose tolerance tests help diagnose gestational diabetes, which is high blood glucose that develops during pregnancy.
Women diagnosed with gestational diabetes and their babies can receive appropriate treatment during pregnancy as well as after delivery. If untreated, mothers with gestational diabetes can pass more glucose to their developing babies than they need, and their fetuses may gain a lot of weight. These mothers may give birth to large babies (weighing 9 pounds or more), which can cause complications for the mothers and their babies, such as difficult labor and delivery, heavy bleeding after delivery, or need for a cesarean delivery. Women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have other conditions, such as high blood pressure. There is an increased risk of preeclampsia for women with gestational diabetes.
Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes may experience more trauma during delivery due to their size. They may have other complications, such as breathing problems, jaundice, and may be born with low glucose levels. These babies also have an increased risk of being stillborn.
Both women who have had gestational diabetes and their babies have an increased risk of developing diabetes later in life.
Several health organizations recommend that all pregnant women should be screened for gestational diabetes using blood tests.
In the U.S., laboratory testing may involve either a one-step or two-step approach:

One-step 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): after a fasting glucose level is measured, a woman is given a 75-gram dose of glucose to drink and her glucose levels are measured at 1 hour and 2 hours after the dose. Only one of the values (including the fasting glucose level) needs to be above a cutoff value for diagnosis of diabetes to be made.
Two-step:
	
Perform a glucose challenge test as a screen: a woman is given a 50-gram glucose dose to drink and her blood glucose level is measured after 1 hour.
If the challenge test is abnormal, perform a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test. After a woman's fasting glucose level is measured, she is given a 100-gram glucose dose and her glucose is measured at timed intervals. If at least 2 of the glucose levels at fasting, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 3 hours are above a certain level, then a diagnosis of gestational diabetes is made.



American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus conference currently recommend the two-step approach, while the Endocrine Society recommends the one-step approach, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) says either the one-step or two-step approach is appropriate.

Glucose tolerance testing may be used to screen pregnant women for gestational diabetes. Several health organizations recommend a glucose tolerance test, using either a one-step or two-step approach. (See ""What is being tested?"")
In most cases, gestational diabetes will go away after delivery, but women who have gestational diabetes will be at an increased risk of having it again with subsequent pregnancies and of developing diabetes in the future. Some organizations, including ACOG and the ADA, recommend that women diagnosed with gestational diabetes be tested 4 to 12 weeks after delivery for diabetes that persists. A fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c test may be used for this purpose.

A glucose tolerance test requires that you fast for 8 to 12 hours (overnight) before the first blood sample is drawn. You will then be given a liquid containing 75 grams of glucose to drink (or 1.75 gram of glucose per kilogram of body weight if you are a child, up to a maximum of 75 grams). Subsequent blood samples are drawn 2 hours after you begin to drink the glucose drink. You have 5 minutes to drink the glucose drink.

Normally, the 75-gram glucose drink raises your blood glucose level, which stimulates the pancreas to release insulin into the blood. Insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by cells. As time passes, the blood glucose level is expected to decrease again back to normal.

Note: The most severe elevation in glucose is used to characterize your status: normal (e.g., nondiabetic), prediabetes (impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance) is present, or diabetes (hyperglycemia) is present. If you have symptoms of diabetes, hyperglycemia that is either fasting or at 2 hours will establish the diagnosis of diabetes. If you are asymptomatic, diabetes is diagnosed when any 2 abnormal results are present on the same day or 2 abnormal results are present on 2 different days.



","



Some medications can increase or decrease your blood glucose level. Be sure to tell your healthcare practitioner about any prescribed or over-the-counter drugs or supplements you take.
Extreme stress can cause a temporary rise in blood glucose. This can be a result of, for example, trauma, surgery, heart attack or stroke.



","



A glucose tolerance test (GTT) may be used to help diagnose prediabetes and diabetes. In some cases, a GTT may be used as a screening test, but most commonly, a fasting blood glucose (FBG) or hemoglobin A1c test is used for diabetes screening.
One common protocol is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT). For this test, you may have a fasting glucose test done, then you drink a 75-gram glucose drink (or 1.75 grams per kilogram of body weight if you are a child). Another blood sample is drawn 2 hours after you begin to drink the glucose drink. This protocol ""challenges"" your body to produce insulin to prevent hyperglycemia while returning the glucose level back to normal.
The GTT is more complicated to perform than other tests used to detect diabetes, such as a FBG or hemoglobin A1c, but is more sensitive and can detect diabetes earlier. Thus, the GTT may sometimes be used to screen for diabetes in certain patient populations (e.g., candidates for kidney transplants).
If the test is used for screening and the initial glucose screening result is abnormal (e.g., hyperglycemia is present at some time during the test), the test may be repeated. The second test result must also be abnormal (e.g., hyperglycemia is present at some time during the test) to confirm a diagnosis of diabetes. Alternatively, an abnormal screening result may be followed by more definitive testing. During the GTT, if only the fasting glucose is in the hyperglycemic range (which is unusual), the repeat test need only be a fasting glucose test.

To detect the presence and identify the general type of bacteria or sometimes fungi (microbes) in a sample taken from the site of a suspected infection; to generally classify bacteria grown in culture so that further identification tests can be performed and appropriate treatment given


","

Pus, body fluid, sputum, or swab of cells taken from the site of an infection; a sample of bacteria or fungi grown and isolated in culture


","



A Gram stain is a laboratory procedure used to detect the presence of bacteria and sometimes fungi in a sample taken from the site of a suspected infection. It gives relatively quick results as to whether bacteria or fungi are present and, if so, the general type(s).
The Gram stain involves applying a sample from the infected area onto a glass slide and allowing it to dry. The slide is then treated with a special stain and examined under a microscope by a trained laboratorian. Any bacteria that may be present are categorized by color and shape during the microscopic evaluation:

Color — typically bacteria may be either ""Gram positive"" (purple) or ""Gram negative"" (pink)
Shape — the most common shapes include round (cocci) or rod-shaped (bacilli)

Additional information may be obtained by observing the groupings of the bacteria on the slide, such as cocci that are present singly, in pairs, in groups of four, in clusters or in chains, or bacilli that are thick, thin, short, long, or have enlarged spores on one end. Any bacteria that are present within white blood cells (intracellular) are also noted.
The Gram stain color and the bacterial shape give clues as to what bacteria might be causing the infection. One example of gram-positive cocci is Staphylococcus aureus, the bacteria associated with staph infections. An example of gram-negative bacteria is Escherichia coli, the cause of many urinary tract infections.
Fungi (in the form of yeasts or molds) can also be initially recognized with the Gram stain, but viruses cannot be seen with a Gram stain.
Though Gram stains are useful as initial tests for detecting and identifying general types of bacteria or fungi, results are usually considered preliminary. Results of a culture and/or other tests such as antigen, antibody, or molecular testing for particular types of bacteria are necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Sometimes, susceptibility testing is necessary to determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating the infection.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Several different types of samples may be collected for Gram stains. Some samples are collected using sterile swabs to obtain cells or exudate at the site of a suspected infection. Other samples, such as urine or sputum, may be collected in a sterile container. Some body fluids may be collected by needle and syringe. A swab may be used to collect a sample of bacteria grown and isolated in a culture.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a bacterial (or sometimes fungal) infection; often whenever a culture is requested


","



A Gram stain is typically ordered along with a culture when a bacterial or sometimes fungal infection is suspected. It is also usually performed when the result of a culture is positive, on a sample of the bacteria grown in the culture. Test results are reported promptly to help guide treatment.



","



A negative Gram stain is often reported as ""no organism seen."" This may mean that there is no bacterial infection present or that there were not enough bacteria present in the sample to be seen with the stain under a microscope.
Positive Gram stain results usually include a description of what was seen on the slide. This typically includes:

Whether the bacteria are Gram-positive (purple) or Gram-negative (pink) 
Shape — round (cocci) or rods (bacilli)
Size, relative quantity, and/or arrangement of the bacteria, if relevant
Whether there are bacteria present within other cells (intracellular) 
Presence of red blood cells or white blood cells
Fungi (in the form of yeasts or molds) may be seen on a Gram stain and are reported. Yeast may appear as single cells that may have buds, while molds may appear as a wide variety of plant-like branches called hyphae. Further testing may be performed to identify the specific type. (See Fungal Tests for more on this.)

This information, along with signs and symptoms and other clinical findings, will help the healthcare practitioner decide which treatment may be most effective, sometimes before culture results are available.
However, Gram stain results are usually considered preliminary, and results of a culture and/or other tests such as antigen and antibody testing for particular types of bacteria are necessary to confirm a diagnosis. Sometimes, susceptibility testing is necessary to determine which antibiotic will be most effective in treating the infection.
A few examples of some medically significant bacteria and what they look like on a Gram stain include:

Gram-positive cocci—Staphylcoccus aureus (Staph aureus) can cause skin infections and toxic shock syndrome; Streptococcus pneumoniae can cause pneumonia.
Gram-negative cocci—Neisseria meningitidis causes meningitis while Neisseria gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea.
Gram-positive bacilli—Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) can cause skin infections or pneumonia (also a bioterrorism agent); Listeria monocytogenes can cause foodborne illnesses.
Gram-negative bacilli—Escherichia coli is a common cause of urinary tract infections.

Samples such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid are generally sterile. Bacteria are not usually present in these samples when there is no bacterial infection. Bacteria may initially be present in low numbers with an infection, and this type of sample may require extra processing in order to concentrate the bacteria so that they can be detected by a Gram stain.
Other body fluids and sites, such as sputum or skin, typically have cells and normal flora present in addition to any bacteria that are causing an infection. Gram stains on these types of samples require careful examination by a trained laboratorian to determine which cells may be normal and which may be due to an infection.



","



Bacterial infections should not be ignored, even if the symptoms are mild. Prompt treatment can limit their spread and severity. If left untreated, bacterial infections can spread and may eventually cause tissue and organ damage.
Viruses cannot be detected with a Gram stain.
If a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a mycobacterial infection, such as tuberculosis, an AFB (acid-fast bacillus) smear and culture may be ordered on a sputum sample instead of a Gram stain and culture.



",,"



A Gram stain is used, along with a culture of the material from an infected site, to identify the cause of a bacterial infection. The Gram stain provides preliminary results on whether bacteria are present and the general type, such as the shape and whether they are Gram-positive or Gram-negative.
Often, detecting the presence of bacteria and determining whether an infection is caused by a microbe that is Gram-positive or Gram-negative will be sufficient to allow a healthcare practitioner to prescribe treatment with an appropriate antibiotic while waiting for more specific tests, such as a culture, to be completed. Absence or presence of white blood cells in the Gram stain can help establish that an adequate sample was obtained as white blood cells are frequently present with an infection.
A Gram stain may also be performed as part of the evaluation of a culture. When bacteria grow on/in a nutrient media in the laboratory, a Gram stain is performed to help determine the type of bacteria present and to help determine what other tests may need to be performed to definitively identify the cause of infection.
Fungi, including yeast, may also be detected with a Gram stain.

growth-hormone,"['GH', 'Human Growth Hormone', 'HGH', 'Somatotropin', 'Growth Hormone Stimulation Test', 'Growth Hormone Suppression Test']","

Follow any instructions you are given, such as to fast, in order to prepare for this test.


","

To help diagnose growth hormone (GH) deficiency or, less commonly, growth hormone excess; to evaluate pituitary function; to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for excess GH


","

Usually several blood samples, drawn at timed intervals from veins; sometimes a single sample of blood, drawn following a fast and rest, after a period of strenuous exercise, or after drinking a glucose (sugar) solution


","



Growth hormone (GH) is a hormone that is essential for normal growth and development in children. It promotes proper linear bone growth from birth through puberty. In both children and adults, growth hormone helps regulate the rate at which the body both produces energy from food (metabolism) and makes lipids, proteins, and glucose (sugar). It also helps regulate the production of red blood cells and muscle mass.
Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland, a small gland located at the base of the brain behind the bridge of the nose. It is normally released into the blood in pulses throughout the day and night with peaks that occur mostly during the night. Because of this, a single measurement of the level of GH in blood is difficult to interpret and not usually clinically useful. The value will be higher if the sample is taken during a pulse and lower if it is taken during a period between pulses.
Therefore, procedures called growth hormone stimulation and suppression tests are most often used to diagnose conditions caused by growth hormone deficiency or excess. These procedures are used in conjunction with signs and symptoms and growth factor levels (i.e., insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3). See ""How is the test used?"" under Common Questions for more detail. 
GH deficiency
Some children have GH deficiency at birth (congenital), but some may develop a deficiency later due, for example, to a brain injury or tumor. These conditions can affect the pituitary gland, causing a decrease in pituitary function, resulting in a lowered production of pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism). Sometimes, the cause of the deficiency is not known, a category referred to as ""idiopathic.""
In adults, growth hormone plays a role in regulating bone density, muscle mass, and glucose and lipid metabolism. It can also affect heart and kidney function. Deficiencies may begin in childhood or develop in adulthood. A deficiency can develop, for example, because of damage to the pituitary gland caused by a head injury, brain tumor, or surgery or radiation treatment. This can result in a decrease in pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism).
GH excess
Excess GH is most often due to a pituitary tumor (usually benign) that produces GH.
Too much GH in children can cause their long bones to continue to grow beyond puberty, resulting in the extremely rare condition, gigantism, with heights of 7 feet or more. Those with excess GH may also have thickening of facial features, general weakness, delayed puberty, and headaches. Pituitary tumors releasing excess growth hormone can cause loss of vision if they grow very large.
Excess GH in adults can lead to the rare condition, acromegaly, marked not by bone lengthening but by bone thickening. Although symptoms such as skin thickening, sweating, fatigue, headaches, and joint pain can be subtle at first, increased GH levels can lead to enlarged hands and feet, enlarged facial bones, carpal tunnel syndrome, and abnormally enlarged internal organs. Excess GH can also cause skin tags and intestinal polyps.
Frequently, the pituitary tumor causing the excess can be surgically removed and/or treated with drugs or radiation. In most cases, this will cause GH and IGF-1 levels to return to normal or near normal levels.
If left untreated, both acromegaly and gigantism can lead to complications such as type 2 diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, and in general, a decreased lifespan.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Growth hormone is released in pulses, so a single measurement of the blood level is not normally clinically useful. Therefore, growth hormone levels are usually measured using growth hormone suppression or stimulation procedures. After fasting for 10 to 12 hours, a blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm. Then, under medical supervision, the suppression or stimulation procedure is performed. This may involve the use of an intravenous (IV) infusion. Blood samples are then drawn from a vein (or from the IV) at timed intervals.
Sometimes, a single sample of blood is drawn following a fast and rest or after a period of strenuous exercise.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Follow any instructions you are given. In most cases, you should be fasting. Resting or strenuous exercise for a time period before collection may be required.
Children and pre-teens who are being tested for GH deficiency should be prepared for treatment with sex steroids for a few days prior to testing. Such treatment reduces the number of falsely low GH responses to stimulation. The healthcare practitioner who is ordering the GH testing should provide the child's parents with a prescription for such medications. Some healthcare practitioners will also prescribe propranolol prior to testing to reduce the number of falsely low GH responses to stimulation.

When a child has slow growth, short stature, and delayed motor development or sometimes when an adult has decreased bone density and/or muscle strength and elevated blood lipid levels that could be related to growth hormone deficiency; when a child or adult has signs and symptoms suggestive of growth hormone excess, which can cause two rare conditions, gigantism and acromegaly, respectively; when a pituitary disorder is suspected and other pituitary hormone levels are abnormal


","



GH stimulation testing is ordered for a child with signs and symptoms of growth hormone deficiency, such as:

A growth rate that slows down in early childhood
Shorter stature than other children of the same chronological age despite normal or enhanced weight gain
Delayed puberty
Delayed bone development (as seen in X-rays)

Stimulation testing may be ordered for an adult when there are signs and symptoms of growth hormone deficiency and/or hypopituitarism, such as:

Decreased bone density
Fatigue
Adverse lipid changes, such as high cholesterol
Reduced exercise tolerance

Other hormone testing, such as thyroid testing, is typically done first to rule out other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. GH deficiency is rare in children and adults.
GH suppression testing is not commonly ordered but may be done when children or adults show signs and symptoms of GH excess (gigantism and acromegaly).
GH and IGF-1 testing may be ordered at regular intervals for many years to monitor for excess GH.



","



GH stimulation test
If GH levels are not significantly stimulated during a GH stimulation test (they stay lower than they should) and you have signs and symptoms of growth hormone deficiency (including a low IGF-1 and/or IGFBP3), then it is likely that you have a GH deficiency that your healthcare practitioner may treat.
If your TSH and/or T4 level is abnormal, then that will likely be addressed first as thyroid disorders can cause symptoms similar to growth hormone deficiency. You may also have hypopituitarism and/or a more general decrease in pituitary function. GH testing for GH deficiency should not be performed until your thyroid function has been evaluated. If hypothyroidism is present in a child, it should be treated and the child's growth rate evaluated before GH testing is considered.
If you exercise vigorously and does not experience an increase in GH levels, then you may have a GH deficiency. This finding would need to be followed up with further testing.
Children diagnosed with GH deficiency who have been receiving GH medications during childhood will need to be retested when they have completed growing.
GH suppression test
If your GH levels are not significantly suppressed during a GH suppression test (they stay higher than they should) and you have signs and symptoms of excess GH (gigantism or acromegaly) and a high IGF-1 level (if measured), then it is likely that you are producing too much GH. If a mass is found on an imaging scan (usually MRI), then a pituitary tumor (usually benign) is likely present. If you are being monitored after successful treatment of a tumor, then increases in GH may indicate a recurrence.



","



Factors that can interfere with GH testing include:

Drugs that can increase GH (e.g., amphetamines, arginine, dopamine, estrogens, glucagon, histamine, insulin, levodopa, methyldopa, and nicotinic acid)
Drugs that can decrease GH levels (e.g., corticosteroids and phenothiazines)

It should be noted that most cases of short stature are not due to GH deficiencies. They can also be related to familial traits, a variety of diseases and conditions, and to other genetic disorders. Rarely, a person may have symptoms associated with GH deficiency but normal or elevated GH levels due to an inherited resistance to GH. In cases of GH resistance, whereas GH levels are high and IGF-1 levels are low.



","



Growth hormone (GH) testing is primarily used to help diagnose growth hormone deficiency and to help evaluate pituitary gland function, usually as a follow-up to other abnormal pituitary hormone test results.
GH testing is also used to detect excess GH and to help diagnose and monitor the treatment of acromegaly and gigantism.
Growth hormone is released in pulses, so a single measurement of the blood level is not normally clinically useful. Therefore, testing for the suppression or stimulation of growth hormone release from the pituitary is usually done.

GH stimulation tests help to diagnose GH deficiency and hypopituitarism. For a stimulation test, a sample of blood is drawn after 10-12 hours of fasting. Then, under close medical supervision, you are given an intravenous solution of a substance that normally stimulates the release of GH from the pituitary. Blood samples are then drawn at timed intervals and GH levels are tested in each to see if the pituitary gland was stimulated to produce the expected levels of GH. Since exercise normally causes an increase in GH, vigorous exercise may also be used as the stimulant for GH release.
GH suppression tests help to diagnose GH excess by determining if GH production is being suppressed by high blood sugar. For a suppression test, a sample of blood is drawn after 10-12 hours of fasting. You are then given a standard glucose solution (either weight-based in children or a standard 100 grams of glucose in adults) to drink. Blood samples are drawn at timed intervals and tested for GH to see if the pituitary gland is sufficiently suppressed by the dose of glucose.

Other tests that may be done include:

IGF-1—growth hormone stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is a hormone that carries out many of the effects of GH and helps promote normal bone and tissue growth and development. However, unlike GH, its level is stable in the blood throughout the day. This makes IGF-1 a useful indicator of average GH levels and the IGF-1 test is often used to help evaluate GH deficiency or GH excess.
IGFBP3—growth hormone also stimulates the production of IGFBP3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3). The circulating level of this protein is also used as a measure of growth hormone action/activity and is especially useful in children younger than 3 years of age.

GH suppression testing and IGF-1 testing can also be used to monitor treatment of a pituitary tumor that produces excess GH. If a tumor is located, GH and IGF-1 levels can be measured after the tumor's removal to determine whether the entire tumor was successfully removed. Tests may be ordered at regular intervals for years afterward to monitor GH production and to detect tumor recurrence.

haptoglobin,"['HPT', 'Hemoglobin-binding Protein', 'Hp']","

","

To help detect and evaluate hemolytic anemia


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Haptoglobin is a protein produced by the liver that the body uses to clear free hemoglobin (found outside of red blood cells) from circulation. This test measures the amount of haptoglobin in the blood.
Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein complex that transports oxygen throughout the body. It is normally found within red blood cells (RBCs) and very little is found free circulating in the blood. Haptoglobin binds to free hemoglobin in the blood. This forms a haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex that is rapidly cleared out of circulation by the liver so that it can be broken down and the iron recycled. Formation of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex also prevents hemoglobin from being filtered by the kidneys and passed into the urine, which can be toxic to the kidneys.
However, when an increased number of RBCs are damaged and/or break apart (hemolysis), they release their hemoglobin into the blood, increasing the amount of free hemoglobin in circulation. When large numbers of RBCs are destroyed, haptoglobin levels in the blood will temporarily decrease as the haptoglobin is used up faster than the liver can produce it. A decrease in the amount of haptoglobin may be a sign that you have a condition that is causing red blood cells to be destroyed or to break apart. When the binding capacity of haptoglobin is exceeded, the free hemoglobin level in circulation goes up and may cause tissue damage and/or organ dysfunction due to oxidative stress of free hemoglobin.
Increased RBC destruction may be due to inherited or acquired conditions. Some examples include transfusion reactions, certain drugs, and mechanical breakage, such as may be seen with some prosthetic heart valves. The destruction may be mild or severe, occurring suddenly (acute) or developing and lasting over a long period of time (chronic), and it can lead to hemolytic anemia. People with hemolytic anemia may experience symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath and their skin may be pale or jaundiced.
Liver disease may also result in decreased haptoglobin levels as liver damage may inhibit both the production of haptoglobin and the clearing of the haptoglobin-free hemoglobin complexes.

When you have signs of anemia such as weakness, paleness, or jaundice that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to red blood cell destruction (hemolytic anemia)


","



The haptoglobin test is ordered when you have symptoms and signs associated with hemolytic anemia. Some examples include:

Fatigue, weakness
Pale skin (pallor)
Fainting
Shortness of breath
A rapid heart rate
Jaundice
Red or brown urine (from the presence of blood/hemoglobin)

Testing may also be done when other laboratory test results are consistent with hemolytic anemia. These may show increased bilirubin, hemoglobin in the urine (hemoglobinuria), decreased RBC count, and increased reticulocyte count and lactate dehydrogenase levels.



","



Results are interpreted carefully and in conjunction with results of other tests, such as a reticulocyte count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), or complete blood count (CBC).
When your haptoglobin level is significantly decreased, along with an increased reticulocyte count and a decreased RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit, then it is likely that you have some degree of hemolytic anemia with red blood cells destroyed in the circulation (intravascular hemolysis).
If your haptoglobin level is normal or borderline normal and your reticulocyte count is increased, then RBC destruction is likely occurring in organs such as the spleen and liver (extravascular hemolysis). Because the free hemoglobin is not released into the blood, the haptoglobin is not used up and remains at a normal level. However, in severe extravascular hemolysis, haptoglobin level can be low because excess hemolysis can release some free hemoglobin into circulation.
If your haptoglobin level is normal and the reticulocyte count is not increased, then it is likely that your anemia is not due to RBC breakdown but due to some other cause.
The following table summarizes some results that may be seen:



Haptoglobin
Reticulocyte count
RBC count, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit
Possible interpretation


Significantly decreased
Increased
Decreased
RBCs are being destroyed within blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis)


Normal or slightly decreased
Increased
Decreased
RBCs destruction likely within organs such as the spleen and liver (extravascular hemolysis)


Normal
Not increased
Decreased
Anemia due to a cause other than RBC destruction (e.g., decrease in RBC production in the bone marrow)



If haptoglobin is decreased without any signs of hemolytic anemia, then it is possible that the liver is not producing adequate amounts of haptoglobin. This may be seen with liver disease, although haptoglobin is not typically used to diagnose or monitor liver disease.



","



Congenital haptoglobin deficiency (called ""anhaptoglobinemia"" that is unrelated to hemolysis or liver disease) is also seen in the general population, affecting about 0.1% of Caucasians and 4% of African Americans (up to 30% in Africans of certain West African origin). Your healthcare provider may order additional tests (e.g., hemopexin test) to help determine if low haptoglobin is congenital or is related to RBC hemolysis.
A low level of haptoglobin is normal for newborns and infants less than 6 months old.



","



Haptoglobin testing is used primarily to help detect and evaluate hemolytic anemia and to distinguish it from anemia due to other causes. Testing is used to help determine whether red blood cells (RBCs) are breaking apart or being destroyed prematurely. It may be used in conjunction with other laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC, including RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit), reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, direct antiglobulin test, and blood smear.
Though the haptoglobin test is a sensitive test for hemolytic anemia, it cannot be used to diagnose the cause of the condition. Other laboratory tests may be needed to help determine the cause, such as tests for autoantibodies to detect autoimmune causes, sickle cell tests, G6PD, or a hemoglobin evaluation.
If you have had a blood transfusion, a haptoglobin test may be ordered along with a direct antiglobulin test to help determine if you have had a transfusion reaction. (For more details, see the article on Transfusion Medicine.)
If your haptoglobin level is low, then testing may be repeated at a later time to monitor your condition, evaluate changes in concentration, and help determine whether the increased destruction of RBCs persists.

To help diagnose and monitor gestational trophoblastic disease or germ cell tumors

A blood sample drawn from a vein

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone, made up of an alpha and beta subunit, that is produced by the placenta and normally is only measurable during pregnancy. Some abnormal tissues, tumors, and cancers, however, may also produce hCG, making the hCG test useful as a tumor marker. This test measures the amount of intact hCG, and sometimes the beta subunit of hCG, in the blood.
An increased level of hCG is seen with gestational trophoblastic disease and some germ cell tumors (benign and cancerous). If hCG is increased with these conditions, then the hCG test can be used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool.
Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a group of tumor types that develop in a woman's uterus from the layer of cells surrounding an embryo that creates the placenta during a normal pregnancy (trophoblasts) and produces hCG. GTD usually occurs at the beginning of pregnancy after an egg has been fertilized, but instead of supporting the growth of a fetus, the cells form abnormal tissue masses. In most cases, the tumors are benign, but in a small percentage of people, they are cancerous. According to the American Cancer Society, GTD occurs in about 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. It can also occur after a normal pregnancy or after a miscarriage or abortion. The primary forms of GTD are:

Hydatidiform mole – also called a ""molar pregnancy,"" which may be complete (only tumor tissue) or a mixture of tumor and fetal tissue but does not develop into a viable baby; these are usually benign but must be surgically removed.
Invasive mole – a hydatidiform mole that grows into the uterus wall; it must be surgically removed; however, the condition can persist if GTD tissue remains.
Choriocarcinoma – a rare cancer that may develop from the GTD tumor tissue in about 2 to 7 per 100,000 pregnancies; these cancers can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body.
Placental site trophoblastic tumor – also rare, this tumor arises at the site of placental attachment in the uterus. This tumor usually develops after a normal or aborted pregnancy but doesn't often spread through the body.
Epithelioid trophoblastic tumor – extremely rare, this tumor is similar in nature to the choriocarcinoma but is now considered a separate disease. It may take many years after a pregnancy for this tumor to be detected and may have already spread to other parts of the body.

Note: With appropriate treatment, the cure rate for most GTD is very high. For more on this, see the links in the Related Content section below.
Germ cell tumors and cancers occur primarily in the ovaries and testicles but can also rarely develop in other locations such as the chest.

Germ cell tumors can occur in the egg-producing cells of the ovaries and are more often seen in younger women (for more, see Ovarian Cancer).
Germ cell tumors can affect cells within the testicles that make sperm and account for more than 90% of testicular cancers (for more, see Testicular Cancer).

Levels of hCG may also be elevated in other diseases such as liver, breast, lung, skin, and stomach cancers. Increased levels may also be seen in non-cancer conditions such as cirrhosis, duodenal ulcer, and inflammatory bowel disease.

When your symptoms suggest gestational trophoblastic disease or germ cell tumors; to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment for these conditions; to monitor for recurrence


","



A quantitative hCG test may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person may have gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) or a germ cell tumor due to the person's clinical presentation, signs and symptoms.
In women, signs and symptoms of GTD may include:

Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy
Fatigue related to anemia (if blood loss is significant)
Abdominal swelling that may happen more rapidly than with a normal pregnancy
Pre-eclampsia early in the pregnancy
Nausea, vomiting that may be more severe than with a normal pregnancy
A positive pregnancy test (qualitative hCG) but no fetus is seen on ultrasound
A uterus that remains enlarged after a pregnancy

Signs and symptoms of a germ cell tumor in women and men are similar to those of ovarian cancer and testicular cancer, respectively.
If a person is diagnosed with one of these conditions and the hCG is initially elevated, then the test will be ordered at intervals to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to detect tumor recurrence.



","



In men and in non-pregnant women, the hCG level is normally undetectable.
When the test is used as a tumor marker, an elevated hCG level may mean that an individual has a germ cell tumor or gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD).
A high level of hCG occurs in both GTD and normal pregnancy. However, hCG rises at a constant and predictable rate, doubling approximately every 36-48 hours in early normal pregnancy. Levels of hCG in GTD show altered rates of production and, paired with imaging such as ultrasound, can identify abnormalities in the pregnancy requiring intervention. Alternatively, the hCG levels may be much higher than expected in normal pregnancy or not show the expected decrease after pregnancy or abortion/miscarriage.
During treatment for GTD or a germ cell tumor, a falling hCG level generally indicates that the condition is responding to treatment (approximately 50% decrease expected every 1.5 days), while persistent or rising levels may indicate that it is not responding to therapy. An increased hCG level after treatment may indicate a recurrence of disease.



","



False-positive serum hCG results may occur due to the presence of certain drugs such as anticonvulsants, antiparkinsonian agents, hypnotics, and tranquilizers that may interfere with the test. In addition, certain types of antibodies that may be present in some individuals and fragments of the hCG molecule, if present, can also interfere with test results. Generally, if results are questionable, they may be confirmed by testing with a different method.
Rarely, an hCG test may be ordered to help diagnose and monitor tumors and cancers other than GTD or germ cell tumors.



",,"



Quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing, often called beta hCG (βhCG), measures the amount of hCG present in the blood. It may be used to help diagnose gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) or, with other tests such as AFP and lactate dehydrogenase, to help diagnose germ cell tumors.
Since hCG is not normally present in men or non-pregnant women, it is useful as a tumor marker. If the tumor or cancer is producing hCG, then the hCG test can be used to help detect and monitor tumor activity.
When testing hCG as a tumor marker, unlike detecting pregnancy, it is important to measure the intact (alpha + beta subunits) form of hCG. There may be some benefit to also measuring the beta-subunit of hCG in certain tumors, and different labs will detect intact and βhCG differently. For this reason, it is very important to continue to use the same lab when monitoring GTD or germ cell tumors.

hdl-cholesterol,"['HDL', 'HDL-C']","

If this test is to be performed as part of a complete lipid panel, fasting for 9 to 12 hours typically will be required (drinking only water), but some healthcare practitioners allow non-fasting lipid panel testing. In particular, children, teens and young adults may have testing done without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether you have fasted.

To determine your risk of developing heart disease

A blood sample is drawn from a vein in your arm. Sometimes a drop of blood is collected by puncturing the skin on a fingertip. This fingerstick sample is typically used when a lipid panel is being measured on a portable testing device, for example, at a health fair.


","



High-density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol, HDL-C) is one of the classes of lipoproteins that carry cholesterol in the blood. HDL-C consists primarily of protein with a small amount of cholesterol. It is considered to be beneficial because it removes excess cholesterol from tissues and carries it to the liver for removal. HDL cholesterol is often called ""good"" cholesterol. The test for HDL cholesterol measures the amount of HDL-C in blood.
High levels of cholesterol have been shown to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and heart disease. When cholesterol levels in the blood increase and not enough is removed by HDL, it may be deposited in the walls of blood vessels. These deposits, called plaques, can build up, causing vessel walls to become more rigid, and may eventually narrow the openings of blood vessels, constricting the flow of blood.
A higher level of blood HDL-C is usually associated with a lower risk of developing plaques, lowering the risk of heart attack or stroke.

Screening: as part of a regular health exam with a lipid panel when no risk factors for heart disease are present; once every four to six years in adults; youth should have a lipid panel at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and then again between the ages of 17 and 21.
Monitoring: may be done more frequently and at regular intervals as part of a lipid panel when risk factors for heart disease are present, when prior results showed high risk levels, and/or when undergoing treatment for unhealthy lipid levels


","



Adults
HDL-C may be ordered as part of a lipid panel during a health checkup. It is recommended that all adults with no risk factors for heart disease be tested every four to six years.
If you have risk factors or if previous testing showed that you had a high cholesterol level, more frequent testing with a full lipid panel is recommended. Major risk factors include:

Smoking
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Being physically inactive—not getting enough exercise
Age (men 45 years or older or women 55 years or older)
Hypertension (blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or taking high blood pressure medications)
Family history of premature heart disease (heart disease in an immediate family member—male relative under age 55 or female relative under age 65)
Pre-existing heart disease or already having had a heart attack
Diabetes or prediabetes

Youths
Children, teens and young adults (ages 2 to 24 years old) with no risk factors should be tested at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and once again between the ages of 17 and 21, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.
Youths with an increased risk of heart disease as adults should have earlier and more frequent screening with lipid panels. Some of the risk factors are like those in adults and include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight. High-risk children should have a fasting lipid panel between the ages of 2 and 8. Children younger than 2 years old are too young to be tested.
Monitoring
HDL-C levels may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or smoking cessation aimed at increasing someone's level of HDL-C.



","



In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy cardiovascular system and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. Your healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of the HDL-C and the other components of a lipid panel as well as other risk factors to help determine your overall risk of heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower your risk of heart disease.
Health organizations have different recommendations for the treatment based on your predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (which is based on your age, weight, blood pressure, whether you smoke or have diabetes, and other factors).
If you are age 40 to 75 and do not have heart disease, current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that a risk calculator be used to determine your 10-year risk of CVD. Many factors are considered in the calculation, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, age, gender, race, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes similar recommendations. For more details, see the Lipid Panel article.
However, use of the risk calculator and ACC/AHA guidelines remain controversial and are evolving as more data become available. Many still use the older guidelines (2002) from the NCEP Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III to evaluate HDL-C levels and heart disease risk as summarized below:
For adults:



 
Low Level, Increased Risk
Average Level, Average Risk
High Level, Less than Average Risk


Women
Less than 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L)
50-59 mg/dL (1.3-1.5 mmol/L)
60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L) or higher


Men
Less than 40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L)
40-50 mg/dL (1.0-1.3 mmol/L)
60 mg/dL (1.55 mmol/L) or higher



Note: Although high HDL-C is considered to be beneficial, a study published in 2018 by the European Society of Cardiology showed that very high levels of HDL cholesterol may also be associated with an increased risk of heart attack and death.
For children, teens and young adults:



Acceptable
45 mg/dL (1.17 mmol/L) or higher


Borderline
40-45 mg/dL (1.04-1.17 mmol/L)


Low Level, Increased Risk
Less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)






","



HDL cholesterol should be measured when you are not ill. Cholesterol is temporarily low during acute illness, immediately following a heart attack, or during stress (like from surgery or an accident). You should wait at least six weeks after any illness to have cholesterol measured.
In women, HDL cholesterol may change during pregnancy. Women should wait at least six weeks after delivery to have their HDL-C measured.



","



The test for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is used as part of a lipid panel to screen for unhealthy levels of lipids and to determine your risk of developing heart disease and help make decisions about what treatment to use if you have borderline risk, intermediate risk, or high risk. The other components of a lipid panel typically include total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglycerides.
The results of the lipid panel are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow up. Depending on the results and other risk factors, treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as diet, cessation of smoking or alcohol, and exercise or medications that lower lipid levels, typically statins.
As part of a lipid panel, HDL-C may also be used to monitor whether treatment has been effective in lowering cholesterol levels.

heavy-metals,['Toxic Metals'],"

You should not eat seafood for 48 hours before sample collection. If you have had a procedure in which either gadolinium- or iodine-containing contrast media has been administered, wait 96 hours before sample collection.


","

To screen for, detect, and monitor excessive exposure to specific heavy metals


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a 24-hour urine sample; rarely, a hair or nail sample, tissue sample, or other body fluid sample


","



A heavy metals panel is a group of tests that detects and measures specific potentially toxic metals in the blood, urine or, more rarely, in the hair or other body tissue or fluid. A laboratory may offer several different heavy metals panels as well as individual tests for metals. The most common combination includes:

Lead
Mercury
Arsenic

Other panels may include one or more additional metals, such as cadmium, copper, or zinc. A healthcare practitioner will select which metals to test based on what you may have been exposed to and your signs and symptoms.
The term ""heavy metals"" is loosely defined. It is related to the periodic table of elements and refers to a variety of elements with high density or metallic properties. These elements are found naturally throughout the environment and are also used by industries to manufacture a wide range of common products. Some of them, such as iron, copper, selenium, molybdenum, and zinc, are required in trace amounts by the body for normal function but can be toxic at higher levels.
Heavy Metals Poisoning
Significant concentrations of any of the heavy metals can be irritating or damaging to the body and can contaminate soil, air, food, and water, persisting indefinitely in the environment. Because they are a source of potential injury, the term ""heavy metals"" is frequently used interchangeably with the term ""toxic metals.""
The signs and symptoms that you may experience depend upon the type of metal, its form, the quantity, the length of exposure, the type of exposure, your age, and your general state of health. Some metals are much more toxic than others, and one form of a metal may be more harmful than other forms, such as an organic versus an inorganic metal compound. How you are exposed can influence the amount of metal absorbed and the part(s) of the body that are affected. For example, a metal that does little when it is held in your hand, or is only moderately harmful and poorly absorbed when swallowed, may be much more toxic and cause severe lung damage when its vapors are inhaled.
Severe acute exposure can cause damage and, in some cases, can be life-threatening, but moderate exposures over time should also be monitored. The body is able to process small amounts of heavy metals, but moderate to large quantities can accumulate in the kidneys, liver, bones and brain. Some metals are considered carcinogenic – they increase the risk of developing cancer – and some can affect the body's ability to produce red and white blood cells. Fetuses and young children are at the highest risk because exposures to low or moderate concentrations can affect physical and mental development and can permanently damage the organs and brain. Many of the metals can be passed from the mother to the fetus, and some can be passed to the infant in breast milk.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Heavy metal testing is usually performed on a blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm or on a 24-hour urine collection. Special metal-free blood or acid-washed urine containers are used to collect the sample to lower the risk of sample contamination by any outside sources of metal.
Urine and blood can both be used for heavy metal testing, but they do not necessarily test for the same forms of a metal. For instance, methylmercury – an organic highly toxic form of mercury found in fish – can be detected in the blood but not in urine. Urine is the preferred sample for measuring inorganic forms of mercury and for measuring arsenic. For lead, blood more accurately correlates with adverse health effects than other fluids or tissues.
Hair and fingernail analysis can give an indication of exposure that has occurred over time or in the past but does not show recent exposures. Independently, they are not to be used to determine exposure. Blood and urine will reflect exposures that are long-term (chronic) or that have happened in the last few days.
In rare cases, a biopsy is performed to obtain a tissue sample for testing.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Refrain from eating seafood 48 hours before sample collection. If you have had a procedure in which either gadolinium- or iodine-containing contrast media has been administered, wait 96 hours before sample collection. For potential industrial exposure, optimal monitoring should be performed with samples collected at the end of the work week.

Periodically when you work with heavy metals, or when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have been exposed to one or more heavy metals


","



A heavy metals panel may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms and/or your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have been acutely or chronically exposed to one or more heavy metals. It may be ordered periodically when you are treated for heavy metal poisoning.
Signs and symptoms of heavy metal exposure will vary in type and severity depending on the type and quantity of metal involved. Early symptoms of poisoning can be missed because they are often non-specific. Excessive exposure and damage to several different organs can occur even if you have no, few, or nonspecific symptoms. Some signs and symptoms of metal poisoning may include:

Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
Nervous system symptoms such as numbness, tingling of hands and feet, weakness
Anemia
Kidney damage
Liver damage
In the lungs – irritation, fluid accumulation (edema)
Brain dysfunction, memory loss
Mees lines (horizontal lines on nails)
Changes in behavior
Malformed bones in children, weakened bones
Developmental delays in children
In pregnant women – miscarriage, premature labor

You may also be monitored periodically when you may be exposed to metals in the workplace. Frequency of monitoring will depend on level of initial exposure, presence or absence of ongoing exposure, and current intervention. Safety measures minimize risk to employees and help address problems when they are identified. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates the use and monitoring of several toxic metals that may be found on the job. If excessive concentrations are detected, affected persons are monitored and steps are taken to reduce their exposure.



","



Care must be taken in the interpretation of heavy metals tests. Your healthcare practitioner will interpret your results in the context of factors such as your risk of exposure, medical history, signs and symptoms, and physical exam.
A low level of a heavy metal in the blood does not necessarily mean that excessive exposure has not occurred. Heavy metals do not stay in the blood and will not be present in the urine for extended periods of time. Lead, for instance, moves from the blood into the body's organs and over time is incorporated into the bones. If you were chronically exposed to lead, then you might have lead in your blood, urine, organs, and bones.
Very low levels of many heavy metals may be present in the blood and urine of apparently healthy people because these metals are present throughout our environment. Recommendations for safe levels of heavy metals depend on your age and may change over time as more information about their safety becomes available.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, scientists found measurable mercury in over 8,000 participants in a study conducted in 2004. The CDC concluded that both blood and urine levels of mercury tend to increase with age. Detecting a measurable amount of mercury in blood or urine does not imply that levels of mercury cause an adverse health effect. Monitoring studies on mercury levels in the body provide physicians and public health officials with reference values so that they can determine whether people have been exposed to higher levels of mercury than are found in the general population.
To learn more about minimal risk levels and/or health effects of a particular metal, visit the ToxFAQs™ section of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website.



","



Exposures to the same amounts and types of heavy metals will not necessarily lead to the same effects in different people because they absorb and eliminate metals at different rates. Those who have underlying health conditions may be more vulnerable than others to the same exposures.
Trace concentrations of heavy metals are monitored and minimized but are almost impossible to avoid altogether. For instance, naturally-occurring arsenic is a contaminant that can be found in some sources of drinking water throughout the world. Small amounts of mercury are found in fluorescent light bulbs and some thermometers. If these break, the mercury can be released. Methylmercury, an organic form of mercury that is produced by bacteria in water, can build up in fish over time. Concentrations vary regionally and with the size of the fish. The highest levels are typically found in bigger and older fish. In most cases, the benefits of eating fish outweigh the small risk of ingesting excess mercury. However, women who are pregnant may want to take extra precautions. The March of Dimes recommends that pregnant women avoid certain types of large fish during their pregnancy because of mercury's potential harm to the fetus.
Lead was once routinely used in paint, plumbing pipes, and as an additive in gasoline. In the U.S., these environmental sources of lead have decreased, but it can be present in the existing paint and plumbing of older homes. In Flint, Michigan, in 2015, for example, no corrosion control was used to prevent lead from entering the water when the town switched its water source from Detroit's water to the Flint River's water (on top of the fact that the river contained eight times as much chloride as Detroit's water). When water from the river flowed through those pipes, it ate away at the pipes, which caused lead to enter the water supply and was deemed unsafe to drink.
When lead house paint deteriorates, it creates lead chips and dust that can be stirred up with the movement of air and can find their way into the soil around the house. While anyone may be harmed by lead exposure, children are at the highest risk. They may eat paint chips, mouth painted surfaces, breath in lead dust, and play in contaminated soil.
In addition to lead, other heavy metals such as arsenic and cadmium have been found to contaminate some toys and jewelry.
All of the sources of heavy metal exposure in the air, water, food supply, and in the environment are controlled, regulated, and monitored by three governmental agencies and the medical community. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) evaluates the effects of exposures, regulates industrial emissions, and establishes maximum contaminant levels for heavy metals such as arsenic in drinking water. The Food and Drug Association (FDA) establishes limits for metals in food, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing young children for lead, especially for those who live in or routinely visit a house built before 1978.



","



Heavy metals testing is used to:

Screen for or to diagnose heavy metal poisoning in those who may have been acutely or chronically exposed to one or more heavy metals
Guide management and treatment of heavy metal poisoning
Monitor excessive metal concentrations in those who work with various heavy metals; such occupations include construction work, mining, radiator repair shops, and firing ranges.
Monitor the effectiveness of chelation therapy, a treatment to rid the body of high amounts of a heavy metal

As mentioned above, your healthcare practitioner may order the metals panel that corresponds to your occupation, hobby, suspected exposure, and/or clinical symptoms. Alternatively, if your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have been exposed to a specific metal, such as lead, your practitioner may order that specific test instead of, or in addition to, a panel. Lead is usually ordered by itself when screening for exposure, especially in children because of how susceptible they are to its effects. If clinically indicated, additional testing to aid in diagnosis may be desired including but not limited to kidney and liver function test, X-rays and electrocardiograms.

You may need to avoid certain medications; follow any instructions you are given.


","

To diagnose an infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), the bacteria that can cause peptic ulcers; to determine whether treatment has cured the infection


","

A stool sample, a breath sample, or a tissue biopsy of the stomach lining


","



Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that is known to be a major cause of peptic ulcers. H. pylori testing detects an infection of the digestive tract caused by the bacteria to help diagnose the cause of symptoms and/or ulcers.
H. pylori infections of the digestive tract are very common, with as many as half of the world's population infected. However, most people with H. pylori never have any symptoms. Still, H. pylori infection increases the risk of developing ulcers (peptic ulcer disease), persistent stomach inflammation (gastritis), and gastric (stomach) cancer. The bacteria decrease the stomach's ability to produce mucus, making the stomach prone to damage from digestive acid and peptic ulcers.
A few different types of H. pylori testing are available, such as a stool antigen test and a breath test. Some are less invasive than others. See the ""How is the test used?"" section under Common Questions for details.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The sample collected depends on the test ordered:

For the urea breath test, a healthcare professional collects an initial sample of your breath by having you breathe into a bag. You are given a liquid to drink containing a substance called urea. Another breath sample is collected after a specific amount of time has elapsed.
For the stool antigen test, a stool sample is collected in a clean container.

A more invasive test will require a procedure called an endoscopy, which involves putting a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end down the throat into the stomach. This allows your healthcare practitioner to view the stomach lining and take a small piece of tissue (a biopsy) from the lining for examination.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For the breath test, you may be instructed to refrain from taking certain medications:

Four weeks before the test, do not take any antibiotics or oral bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto Bismol®).
Two weeks before the test, do not take any prescription or over-the-counter proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or esomeprazole.
One hour before the test, do not eat or drink anything (including water).

If submitting a stool sample or having a tissue biopsy collected, it may be necessary to refrain from taking any antibiotics, antacids, or bismuth treatments for 14 days prior to the test.
If undergoing endoscopy, fasting, usually overnight, may be required. Only water may be permitted.

When you have symptoms of an ulcer, such as ongoing indigestion, gastrointestinal pain that comes and goes, unexplained weight loss, nausea and/or vomiting; about 4-6 weeks after completing treatment for the infection

Testing may be ordered when you have pain in your digestive tract and other signs and symptoms of an ulcer. Examples include:

Abdominal pain that comes and goes over time
Unexplained weight loss
Indigestion
Feeling of fullness or bloating 
Nausea
Belching

Some people may have more serious signs and symptoms that require immediate medical attention, including sharp, sudden, persistent stomach pain, bloody or black stools, or bloody vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds.
H. pylori testing may also be ordered about 4 to 6 weeks after you have finished taking the prescribed antibiotics to confirm that the infection is cured. A follow-up test is not performed on every person, however.



","



A positive H. pylori stool antigen, breath test, or biopsy indicates that your signs and symptoms are likely caused by a peptic ulcer due to these bacteria. Treatment with a combination of antibiotics and other medications will be prescribed to kill the bacteria and stop the pain and the ulceration.
A negative test result means that it is unlikely that you have an H. pylori infection and your signs and symptoms may be due to another cause. However, if symptoms persist, additional testing may be done, including the more invasive tissue biopsy, to more conclusively rule out infection.



","



People can have digestive tract pain for many reasons; an ulcer caused by H. pylori is only one of them.
If you use antacids within the week prior to testing, the rapid urease test may be falsely negative. Antimicrobials, proton pump inhibitors, and bismuth preparations may interfere with test results.



","



H. pylori testing is used to detect the bacteria in the digestive tract, diagnose the infection, and to evaluate whether treatment has cured the infection.
There are several different types of H. pylori testing that can be performed. The following tables summarize these tests:
Without Endoscopy



Stool/fecal antigen test
Detects the presence of H. pylori antigen in a stool sample


Urea breath test


A healthcare professional will take an initial sample of your breath (baseline) by having you breathe into a bag.
You will be instructed to drink a liquid containing a substance called urea, which is specially 'labeled' and then wait about 15 minutes. During this time, if H. pylori is present in your digestive tract, the bacteria will break the urea down into labeled carbon dioxide gas, which is expelled in your breath. (Carbon dioxide is a normal part of the breath that you exhale.)
A second breath sample is collected.
Both the initial and second sample are sent to a lab for testing. If your second breath sample has a higher level of labeled carbon dioxide than normal, you have H. pylori in your digestive tract.





With Endoscopy: tissue biopsy sample obtained; good tests but less frequently ordered because invasive



Histology
Tissue examined under a microscope by a pathologist, who will look for H. pylori bacteria and any other signs of disease that may explain a person's symptoms.


Rapid urease testing
H. pylori produces urease, an enzyme that allows it to survive in the acidic environment of the stomach. The laboratory test can detect urease in the tissue sample.


Culture
The bacteria are grown on/in a nutrient media; results can take several weeks. This test is necessary if the healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate which antibiotic will likely cure the infection. (See also Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing.)


PCR (polymerase chain reaction)
Fragments of H. pylori DNA are amplified and used to detect the bacteria; primarily used in a research setting.



The stool antigen test and urea breath test are recommended for the diagnosis of an H. pylori infection and for the evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment. These tests are the most frequently performed because they are fast and noninvasive. (The urea breath test is not typically recommended for young children. In children, the preferred test would be the stool antigen test.) Endoscopy-related tests may also be performed to diagnose and evaluate H. pylori but are less frequently performed because they are invasive.
The testing recommendations come from guidelines by the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA), the American College of Gastroenterologists (ACG), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) / the American Society for Microbiology (ASM).

To determine the proportion of your blood that is made up of red blood cells (RBCs) in order to screen for, help diagnose, or monitor conditions that affect RBCs; as part of a routine health examination or if your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have anemia or polycythemia


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein or by a fingerstick (children and adults) or heelstick (newborns)


","



A hematocrit is a test that measures the proportion of your blood that is made up of red blood cells (RBCs). Blood consists of RBCs, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets suspended in a fluid portion called plasma. The hematocrit is a ratio of the volume of red blood cells to the volume of all these components together, called whole blood. The value is expressed as a percentage or fraction. For example, a hematocrit value of 40% means that there are 40 milliliters of red blood cells in 100 milliliters of whole blood.
The hematocrit is a fairly quick and simple way of evaluating your red blood cells and checking for conditions such as anemia. It is often performed in conjunction with a hemoglobin level and is also one component of the complete blood count (CBC), a group of tests that are often used in the general evaluation of your health.
The hematocrit reflects both the number of red blood cells and their volume (mean corpuscular volume or MCV). If the number and/or size of RBCs decreases, so will the hematocrit and vice versa. In general, the hematocrit will rise when the number of red blood cells increases and the hematocrit will fall to less than normal when there is a decrease in RBCs.
RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream when they are, or nearly are, mature. They typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen. The primary function of RBCs is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. They also transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a byproduct of cell metabolism, from tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled.
The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days and the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect the production of new RBCs by the bone marrow. Other conditions may affect the lifespan of RBCs in the circulation. If there is increased destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) or loss of RBCs (bleeding) and/or the bone marrow is not able to produce new ones fast enough, then the overall number of RBCs and hematocrit will drop, resulting in anemia.
In anemia, the body does not have the capacity to deliver enough oxygen to tissues and organs, causing fatigue and weakness. In polycythemia, too many RBCs are produced (resulting in increased hematocrit) and the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems.

","



The hematocrit is routinely ordered as a part of the complete blood count (CBC). It may also be ordered by itself or with a hemoglobin level as part of a general health exam. These tests are often ordered when you have signs and symptoms of a condition affecting RBCs, such as anemia and polycythemia.
Some signs and symptoms of anemia include:

Weakness or fatigue
Lack of energy
Fainting
Paleness (pallor)
Shortness of breath
Fast or irregular heartbeat
Cold hands or feet

Some signs and symptoms of polycythemia include:

Disturbed vision
Dizziness
Headache
Flushing
Enlarged spleen

A hematocrit may sometimes be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of serious dehydration, such as extreme thirst, dry mouth or mucous membranes, and lack of sweating or urination.
This test may be performed several times or on a regular basis when you have been diagnosed with ongoing bleeding problems, anemia, or polycythemia to determine the effectiveness of treatment. It may also be ordered routinely if you are undergoing treatment for cancer that is known to affect the bone marrow.



","



Red blood cells (RBCs) typically make up roughly 37% to 49% of the volume of blood.
Since a hematocrit is often performed as part of a complete blood count (CBC), results from other components, such as RBC count, hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and/or red blood cell indices, are taken into consideration. Age, sex, and race are other factors to be considered. In general, the hematocrit mirrors the results of the RBC count and hemoglobin.
A low hematocrit with low RBC count and low hemoglobin indicates anemia. Some examples of causes include:

Excessive loss of blood from, for example, severe trauma, or chronic bleeding from sites such as the digestive tract (e.g., ulcers, polyps, colon cancer), the bladder or uterus (in women, heavy menstrual bleeding, for example)
Nutritional deficiencies such as iron, folate or B12 deficiency
Damage to the bone marrow from, for example, a toxin, radiation or chemotherapy, infection or drugs
Bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or other cancers that spread to the marrow
Kidney failure—severe and chronic kidney diseases lead to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates RBC production by the bone marrow.
Chronic inflammatory diseases or conditions
Decreased production of hemoglobin (e.g., thalassemia)
Excessive destruction of red blood cells, for example, hemolytic anemia caused by autoimmunity or defects in the red blood cell itself; the defects could be hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell anemia), abnormalities in the RBC membrane (e.g., hereditary spherocytosis) or RBC enzyme (e.g., G6PD deficiency)

A high hematocrit with a high RBC count and high hemoglobin indicates polycythemia. Some examples of causes of a high hematocrit include:

Dehydration—this is the most common cause of a high hematocrit. As the volume of fluid in the blood drops, the RBCs per volume of fluid artificially rises; with adequate fluid intake, the hematocrit returns to normal.
Lung (pulmonary) disease—if you are unable to breathe in and absorb sufficient oxygen, the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Congenital heart disease—in some forms, there is an abnormal connection between the two sides of the heart, leading to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. The body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Kidney tumor that produces excess erythropoietin
Smoking
Living at high altitudes (a compensation for decreased oxygen in the air)
Genetic causes (altered oxygen sensing, abnormality in hemoglobin oxygen release)
Polycythemia vera—a rare disease in which the body produces excess RBCs inappropriately

A recent blood transfusion will affect hematocrit results.
Pregnancy usually causes slightly decreased hematocrit values due to extra fluid in the blood.

The hematocrit test is often used to check for anemia, usually along with a hemoglobin test or as part of a complete blood count (CBC). The test may be used to screen for, diagnose, or monitor a number of conditions and diseases that affect red blood cells (RBCs).

Identify and evaluate the severity of anemia (low RBCs, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit) or polycythemia (high RBCs, high hemoglobin, high hematocrit)
Monitor the response to treatment of anemia or polycythemia and other disorders that affect RBC production or lifespan
Help make decisions about blood transfusions or other treatments if anemia is severe
Evaluate dehydration

Hemoglobin is the iron-containing protein found in all red blood cells (RBCs) that gives the cells their characteristic red color. Hemoglobin enables RBCs to bind to oxygen in the lungs and carry it to tissues and organs throughout the body. It also helps transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a product of cell metabolism, from tissues and organs to the lungs, where it is exhaled.
The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin your sample of blood. A hemoglobin level can be performed alone or with a hematocrit, a test that measures the proportion of blood that is made up of RBCs, to evaluate your red blood cells. It is also one component of the complete blood count (CBC), a group of tests that are often used in the general evaluation of your health.
Red blood cells, which make up about 40% (ranging 37-49%) of the blood's volume, are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream when they are, or nearly are, mature. The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days, and the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding.
Several diseases and conditions can affect RBCs and consequently the level of hemoglobin in the blood. In general, the hemoglobin level and hematocrit rise when the number of red blood cells increases. The hemoglobin level and hematocrit fall to less than normal when there is a decrease in RBCs.
Some conditions affect RBC production in the bone marrow and may cause an increase or decrease in the number of mature RBCs released into the blood circulation. Other conditions may affect the lifespan of RBCs in the circulation. If there is increased destruction of RBCs (hemolysis) or loss of RBCs through bleeding and/or the bone marrow is not able to produce new ones fast enough, then the overall number of RBCs and hemoglobin will drop, resulting in anemia.
Anemia is a condition in which tissues and organs in the body do not get enough oxygen, causing fatigue and weakness. If too many RBCs are produced, polycythemia results and the blood can become thickened, causing sluggish blood flow and related problems.

","



Since a hemoglobin level is often performed as part of a complete blood count (CBC), results from other components are taken into consideration. A rise or drop in the hemoglobin level must be interpreted in conjunction with other parameters, such as RBC count, hematocrit, reticulocyte count, and/or red blood cell indices. Age, sex, and race are other factors to be considered. In general, hemoglobin mirrors the results of the RBC count and hematocrit.
Low hemoglobin with low RBC count and low hematocrit indicates anemia. Some examples of causes include:

Excessive loss of blood from, for example, severe trauma or chronic bleeding from sites such as the digestive tract (e.g., ulcers, polyps, colon cancer), the bladder or uterus (in women, heavy menstrual bleeding, for example)
Nutritional deficiencies such as iron, folate or B12 deficiency
Damage to the bone marrow from, for example, a toxin, radiation or chemotherapy, infection or drugs
Bone marrow disorders such as aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or other cancers that spread to the marrow
Kidney failure—severe and chronic kidney diseases lead to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates RBC production by the bone marrow.
Chronic inflammatory diseases or conditions
Decreased hemoglobin production (e.g., thalassemia)
Excessive destruction of red blood cells, for example, hemolytic anemia caused by autoimmunity or defects in the red blood cell itself; the defects could be hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell anemia), abnormalities in the RBC membrane (e.g., hereditary spherocytosis) or RBC enzyme (e.g., G6PD deficiency).

High hemoglobin with a high RBC count and high hematocrit indicates polycythemia. Some examples of causes include:

Lung (pulmonary) disease—if someone is unable to breathe in and absorb sufficient oxygen, the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Congenital heart disease—in some forms, there is an abnormal connection between the two sides of the heart, leading to reduced oxygen levels in the blood. The body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Kidney tumors that produce excess erythropoietin
Smoking—heavy smokers have higher hemoglobin levels than nonsmokers.
Genetic causes (altered oxygen sensing, abnormality in hemoglobin oxygen release)
Living at high altitudes (a compensation for decreased oxygen in the air)
Dehydration—as the volume of fluid in the blood drops, the hemoglobin artificially rises.
Polycythemia vera—a rare disease in which the body produces excess RBCs inappropriately

Hemoglobin A1c, also called A1c or glycated hemoglobin, is hemoglobin with glucose attached. The A1c test evaluates the average amount of glucose in the blood over the last 2 to 3 months by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood.
Hemoglobin is an oxygen-transporting protein found inside red blood cells (RBCs). There are several types of normal hemoglobin, but the predominant form – about 95-96% – is hemoglobin A. As glucose circulates in the blood, some of it spontaneously binds to hemoglobin A.
The higher the level of glucose in the blood, the more glycated hemoglobin is formed. Once the glucose binds to the hemoglobin, it remains there for the life of the red blood cell – normally about 120 days. The predominant form of glycated hemoglobin is referred to as A1c. A1c is produced on a daily basis and slowly cleared from the blood as older RBCs die and younger RBCs (with non-glycated hemoglobin) take their place.
An A1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes or risk of developing diabetes. Standards of medical care in diabetes from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) state that diabetes may be diagnosed based on A1c criteria or blood glucose criteria (e.g., the fasting blood glucose (FBG) or the 2-hour glucose tolerance test).
A1c is also used to monitor treatment for individuals diagnosed with diabetes. It helps to evaluate how well your glucose levels have been controlled by treatment over time. For monitoring purposes, an A1c of less than 7% indicates good glucose control and a lower risk of diabetic complications for the majority of people with diabetes.
However, the ADA and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) recommend that the management of glucose control in people with type 2 diabetes be more ""patient-centered."" It is recommend that people work closely with their healthcare practitioner to select a goal that reflects each person's individual health status and that balances risks and benefits.

As part of a health checkup or when you have risk factors for or symptoms of diabetes; after first diagnosis with diabetes, every 3-4 months or about 120 days to ensure that your glycemic goals are met and/or maintained or when your therapy plan has changed 


","



Screening and diagnosis
A1c may be ordered as part of a health checkup or when someone is suspected of having diabetes because of classical signs or symptoms of increased blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) such as:

Increased thirst and drinking fluids
Increased urination
Increased appetite
Fatigue
Blurred vision
Slow-healing infections
	 

The A1c test may also be considered in adults who are overweight with the following additional risk factors:

Physical inactivity
First-degree relative (sibling or parent) with diabetes
High-risk race/ethnicity (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander)
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Abnormal lipid panel (low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglycerides)
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome
History of cardiovascular diseases
Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance
	 

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends to begin A1c testing at age 45 for overweight or obese people; if the result is normal, the testing should be repeated at a minimum of 3-year intervals, with consideration of more frequent testing depending on initial results and risk status, or when classical signs or symptoms of increased blood glucose levels are observed.
People who are not diagnosed with diabetes but are determined to be at increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes) should have their A1c level tested at least yearly.
Monitoring
Depending on the type of diabetes that a person has, how well that person's diabetes is controlled, and on the healthcare practitioner's recommendations, the A1c test may be measured 2 to 4 times each year. The ADA recommends A1c testing for people with diabetes at least twice a year if they are meeting treatment goals and under stable glycemic control. When someone is first diagnosed with diabetes or if optimal glucose levels are not achieved, A1c may be ordered quarterly.



","



In screening and diagnosis, some results that may be seen include:

A person who does not have diabetes: A1c result less than 5.7% (39 mmol/mol)
Diabetes: A1c level is 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) or higher
Increased risk of developing diabetes in the future (pre-diabetes): A1c of 5.7% to 6.4% (39-46 mmol/mol)
	 

For monitoring glucose control, A1c is currently reported as a percentage and, for most people with diabetes, it is recommended that they aim to keep their hemoglobin A1c below 7%. The closer they can keep their A1c to the American Diabetes Association (ADA)'s therapeutic goal of less than 7% without experiencing excessive low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), the better their diabetes is in control. As the A1c increases, so does the risk of complications.
However, if you have type 2 diabetes, you may select an A1c goal in consultation with your healthcare practitioner. The goal may depend on several factors, such as length of time since diagnosis, the presence of other diseases as well as diabetes complications (e.g., vision impairment or loss, kidney damage), risk of complications from hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, and whether or not the person has a support system and healthcare resources readily available.
For example, a person with heart disease who has lived with type 2 diabetes for many years without diabetic complications may have a higher A1c target (e.g., 7.5%-8.0%) set by their healthcare practitioner, while someone who is otherwise healthy and just diagnosed may have a lower target (e.g., 6.0%-6.5%) as long as low blood sugar is not a significant risk.
The A1c test report also may include the result expressed in SI units (mmol/mol) and an estimated Average Glucose (eAG), which is a calculated result based on the hemoglobin A1c levels. The estimated Average Glucose (eAG) reflects indirectly the glucose level over a period of 2-3 months before the A1c measurement.
The purpose of reporting eAG is to help a person relate A1c results to everyday glucose monitoring levels and to laboratory glucose tests. The formula for eAG converts percentage A1c to units of mg/dL or mmol/L. (For details, see below.)
It should be noted that the eAG is still an evaluation of a person's glucose over the last couple of months. It will not match up exactly to any one daily glucose test result. The ADA has adopted this calculation and provides a calculator and information on the eAG on their DiabetesPro web site. The NGSP web site also provides a calculator to convert hemoglobin A1c in SI units mmol/mol into percentage.



","



The A1c test will not reflect temporary, acute blood glucose increases or decreases, or good control that has been achieved in the last 3-4 weeks. The glucose swings of someone who has ""brittle"" diabetes will also not be reflected in the A1c.
Any condition that affects the quality and quantity of red blood cells (RBCs) and hemoglobin (e.g. iron deficiency, bleeding, hemolysis, etc.) will affect A1c test results. For example, if someone is iron-deficient, the A1c level may be increased or if a person receives erythropoietin therapy or has had a recent blood transfusion, the A1c may be inaccurate and may not accurately reflect glucose control for 2-3 months.



","



Screening and diagnosis
The hemoglobin A1c test may be used to screen for and diagnose diabetes and prediabetes in adults. 
The A1c test, however, should not be used for:

Screening for cystic fibrosis-related diabetes 
Diagnosis of gestational diabetes in pregnant women 
Diagnosis of diabetes in children and teens 
People who have had recent severe bleeding or blood transfusions 
People with chronic kidney disease or liver disease 
People with blood disorders such as iron-deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency anemia
Individuals with some hemoglobin variants (e.g., sickle cell disease or thalassemia)
	 

In these cases, a fasting plasma glucose,  oral glucose tolerance test or fructosamine test should be used for screening or diagnosing diabetes.
Only A1c tests that have been referenced to an accepted laboratory method (National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program certified) should be used for diagnostic or screening purposes. Currently, point-of-care tests, such as those that may be used at a healthcare practitioner's office or a patient's bedside, are not accurate enough for use in diagnosis but can be used to monitor treatment (lifestyle and drug therapies).
Monitoring
The A1c test is also used to monitor the glucose control of people with diabetes over time. The goal of those with diabetes is to keep their blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. This helps to minimize the complications caused by chronically elevated glucose levels, such as progressive damage to body organs like the kidneys, eyes, cardiovascular system, and nerves. Unlike glucose results, which provide information about the glycemic status of a person strictly for the time of blood collection, the A1c test result gives a picture of the average amount of glucose in the blood over the last 2-3 months. This can help people with diabetes and their healthcare practitioners know if the measures that are being taken to control their diabetes are successful or need to be adjusted.
A1c is frequently used to people help newly diagnosed with diabetes determine how elevated their uncontrolled blood glucose levels have been over the last 2-3 months. The test is ordered several times until an optimal glucose level is achieved.

A hemoglobinopathy is an inherited blood disorder in which there is an abnormal form of hemoglobin (variant) or decreased production of hemoglobin (thalassemia). A hemoglobinopathy evaluation is a group of tests that determines the presence and relative amounts of abnormal forms of hemoglobin in order to screen for and/or diagnose a hemoglobin disorder.
Hemoglobin (Hb) is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that binds to oxygen in the lungs and allows RBCs to carry the oxygen throughout the body, delivering it to the body's cells and tissues. Hemoglobin consists of one portion called heme, which is the molecule with iron at the center, and another portion made up of four globin (protein) chains. Depending on their structure, the globin chains, depending on their structure, have different designations: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. The types of globin chains that are present are important in the function of hemoglobin and its ability to transport oxygen.
Normal hemoglobin types include:

Hemoglobin A: makes up about 95%-98% of Hb found in adults; it contains two alpha and two beta protein chains.
Hemoglobin A2:  makes up about 2%-3% of Hb in adults; it has two alpha and two delta protein chains.
Hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin): makes up to 1%-2% of Hb found in adults; it has two alpha and two gamma protein chains. This is the primary hemoglobin produced by the fetus during pregnancy; its production usually falls shortly after birth and reaches adult levels by 1-2 years.

Hemoglobinopathies occur when changes (variants) in the genes that provide information for making the globin chains cause changes in the proteins. These genetic variants may result in a reduced production of one of the normal globin chains or in the production of structurally altered globin chains. Approximately 7% of the world's population carry at least one copy of a genetic variant in one of the hemoglobin chains (carrier), and the rate can vary dramatically based on ethnicity. Genetic variants may affect the structure of the hemoglobin, its behavior, its production rate, and/or its stability. The presence of abnormal hemoglobin within RBCs can alter the appearance (size and shape) and function of the red blood cells.
Red blood cells containing abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin variants) may not carry oxygen efficiently and may be broken down by the body sooner than usual (a shortened survival), resulting in hemolytic anemia.
While there are more than 1,000 hemoglobinopathies currently described and novel forms are still being discovered, some of the most common hemoglobin variants include:

Hemoglobin S, the primary hemoglobin in people with sickle cell disease that causes the RBC to become misshapen (sickle), decreasing the cell's survival
Hemoglobin C, which can cause a minor amount of hemolytic anemia
Hemoglobin E, which may cause no symptoms or generally mild symptoms

Thalassemia is a condition in which a gene variant results in reduced production of one of the globin chains. This can upset the balance of alpha to beta chains, leading to decrease in hemoglobin A, causing abnormal forms of hemoglobin to form (alpha thalassemia) or causing an increase of minor hemoglobin components, such as Hb A2 or Hb F (beta thalassemia).
Hemoglobinopathies can be thought of as an alteration of quality of the hemoglobin molecule (how well it functions), while thalassemias are an alteration of quantity.
Many other less common hemoglobin variants exist. Some are silent – causing no signs or symptoms – while others affect the function and/or stability of the hemoglobin molecule.
To learn more about these conditions, read the articles on Hemoglobin Abnormalities and Thalassemia.
A hemoglobinopathy evaluation typically involves tests that determine the types and amounts of hemoglobin. Information from these tests, along with results from routine tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear, aid in establishing a diagnosis.

","



Testing for specific hemoglobinopathies is required as part of state-mandated newborn screening. In addition, it is often used for prenatal screening when a parent is at high risk or when parents have a child who has a hemoglobinopathy.
An evaluation is usually ordered when results of a complete blood count (CBC) and/or blood smear suggest that you have an abnormal form of hemoglobin.
Testing may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that your signs and symptoms are the result of abnormal hemoglobin production. Abnormal forms of hemoglobin often lead to hemolytic anemia, resulting in signs and symptoms such as:

Weakness, fatigue
Lack of energy
Jaundice
Pale skin

Some severe forms of hemoglobinopathies (e.g., sickle cell disease) may result in serious signs and symptoms, such as episodes of severe pain, shortness of breath, enlarged spleen, and growth problems in children.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting the results of a hemoglobinopathy evaluation. Typically, the laboratory report includes an interpretation by a pathologist with experience in the field of hematology (hematopathologist).
Results of the evaluation usually report the types of hemoglobin present and the relative amounts. For adults, percentages of normal hemoglobin include:

Hemoglobin A1(HB A1): about 95%-98%
Hemoglobin A2 (Hb A2): about 2%-3%
Hemoglobin F (Hb F): 2% or less

Some of the most common abnormal forms of hemoglobin that may be detected and measured with this testing include:

Hemoglobin S (Hb S, sickle cell disease or trait)
Hemoglobin C (Hb C)
Hemoglobin E (Hb E)

Some less common forms include:

Hemoglobin F (Hb F): Hb F may be elevated in several disorders, such as beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia.
Hemoglobin H (Hb H)
Hemoglobin Barts

Other types that may be identified include:

Hemoglobin D
Hemoglobin G
Hemoglobin J
Hemoglobin M
Hemoglobin Constant Spring

Less common forms often are named after the location of the family or families in whom the genetic variant was first identified (i.e.. Hemoglobin Constant Spring).
Testing may help identify thalassemia by detecting abnormal hemoglobin (e.g., hemoglobin H in alpha thalassemia) or an increase of minor hemoglobin components, such as Hb A2 or Hb F (beta thalassemia).
Two different abnormal genes can be inherited, one from each parent, that may result in a combination of abnormal hemoglobins detected by testing. This is known as being compound heterozygous or doubly heterozygous. Clinically significant combinations — those that result in significant signs and symptoms — include hemoglobin SC disease (symptoms can mimic sickle cell disease), hemoglobin E – beta thalassemia, and hemoglobin S – beta thalassemia.
For more information on these conditions, see the articles on Hemoglobin Abnormalities and Thalassemia.
The following table provides some examples of results that may be seen with a hemoglobinopathy evaluation:

Blood transfusions can interfere with hemoglobinopathy evaluation because any of the methods will detect both the blood donor and your hemoglobin forms, potentially hindering the results. You should wait several months after a transfusion before having this testing done. However, in people with sickle cell disease, the testing may be performed after a transfusion to determine if enough normal hemoglobin has been given to reduce the risk of damage from sickling of red blood cells and prevent sickle cell crisis.



","



A hemoglobinopathy evaluation is used to detect abnormal forms and/or relative amounts of hemoglobin, the protein found in all red blood cells that transports oxygen. Testing may be used for:

Screening
	
All states require that newborns be screened for sickle cell disease, S/C Disease and S,Beta-Thalassemia; however, only 87% of states screen for other hemoglobinopathy types.
Prenatal screening is often performed on high-risk parents with an ethnic background associated with a higher prevalence of hemoglobin disorders and those with affected family members. Screening may also be done in conjunction with genetic counseling prior to pregnancy to determine whether the parents are carriers.
To identify variants in asymptomatic parents who have an affected child


Diagnosis
	
To detect and/or identify hemoglobinopathy (hemoglobin abnormality or thalassemia) in those with symptoms of unexplained anemia or abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC)



Several different laboratory methods are available to evaluate the types of hemoglobin that a person has. Some of these include:

Hemoglobin solubility test: used to test specifically for hemoglobin S, the main hemoglobin in sickle cell disease
Hemoglobin gel electrophoresis (Hb ELP)
Hemoglobin isoelectric focusing (Hb IEF)
Hemoglobin by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
Hemoglobin by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE)
Hemoglobin by mass spectrometry

These methods evaluate the different types of hemoglobin based on the physical and chemical properties of the different hemoglobin molecules.
Most of the common hemoglobin variants or thalassemias can be identified using one of these tests or a combination. The relative amounts of any variant hemoglobin detected can aid in a diagnosis. However, a single test is usually not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of hemoglobinopathy. Rather, the results of several different tests are considered. Examples of other laboratory tests that may be performed include:

CBC
Blood smear
Reticulocyte count
Iron studies such as serum iron, TIBC, transferrin
Genetic testing: may be used to detect variants in the genes that code for the protein chains (alpha and beta globulin) that comprise hemoglobin. This is not a routine test but can be used to confirm whether you have a genetic variant and whether there is one or two copies of the variant (heterozygous or homozygous).

Heparin is a drug that inhibits blood clotting (anticoagulant) and is used to treat people who have developed dangerous blood clots (thrombi) or have a high risk of developing them. This test indirectly measures the amount of heparin in a person's blood by measuring its inhibition of factor Xa activity, one of the proteins involved in blood clot formation (known as heparin anti-Xa activity).
The test is used to monitor heparin therapy to ensure that a person is receiving sufficient heparin for anticoagulation without causing excess bleeding. Since the test involves a chemical reaction color change (colorimetric), it is also known as chromogenic anti-Xa assay or anti-Xa assay, chromogenic.
Blood clotting is a normal response to blood vessel or tissue injury. It is a complex process that involves the activation and clumping of platelets at the site of injury and the initiation of the coagulation cascade, a sequential activation of coagulation factors, proteins that produce clots and regulate their development.
There are a variety of conditions that can cause excessive clotting and lead to the formation of blood clots within veins and arteries. Some examples include surgeries, DVT (deep vein thrombosis), and other excessive clotting disorders (hypercoagulable disorders). These clots can obstruct blood flow and cause tissue damage. Pieces of the blood clot can also break off and travel to the lungs, causing pulmonary embolism. In pregnant women, blood clot formation can sometimes occur in the placenta and affect blood flow to the developing baby (fetus) and result in a miscarriage.
Heparin may be used to prevent or treat these excessive clotting conditions (anticoagulation therapy). Through its binding to the protein antithrombin, heparin interferes with the clotting process by inhibiting clotting factors, particularly factors Xa and IIa (thrombin).
Heparin molecules vary in size and activity and there are three types of heparin that may be used for treatment:

Standard heparin, commonly known as unfractionated heparin (UFH), is usually given through injections into a vein (intravenously, IV). UFH affects both factors Xa and IIa and has varying effects among patients, so it must be closely monitored. Complications may include clotting (insufficient heparin), excessive bleeding (too much heparin), and sometimes decrease in platelets and thrombosis (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis).
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) consists of a narrower range of smaller heparin molecules and is typically given through injections under the skin (subcutaneous). LMWH primarily affects Xa and its effect is more predictable; therefore, routine laboratory monitoring is not required.
Fondaparinux consists of only a small fraction of UFH (a sequence of five monomeric sugar units of heparin) and only inhibits factor Xa. It does not inhibit thrombin. Like LMWH, fondaparinux is given subcutaneously and routine laboratory monitoring is not required.

Unfractionated heparin is often used for initial treatment when excessive clotting conditions are acute. It is eventually replaced by the use of oral anticoagulants or LMWH for longer-term treatment to lower the risk of blood clots. UFH is usually given in a hospital setting and monitored with the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test, but it may need to be monitored with the heparin anti-Xa test.
High doses of UFH given during surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass are typically monitored using the activated clotting time (ACT) test.
LMWH and fondaparinux may be given in either an outpatient or hospital setting. Neither LMWH nor fondaparinux significantly prolong PTT at therapeutic dosage. If monitoring is required, the anti-Xa test is used.

","

When you are being treated with UFH or LMWH and your healthcare provider wants to monitor the amount of heparin in your blood


","



The heparin anti-Xa test is not routinely ordered but may be performed whenever a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux concentrations in the blood.
It may be ordered periodically to monitor UFH therapy, especially when a person is not responding as expected to UFH or when the PTT is not useful.
When it is used as a LMWH and fondaparinux monitoring tool, heparin anti-Xa is primarily ordered as a ""peak"" test. It is typically collected about 4 hours and 3 hours after a LMWH and fondaparinux dose is given, respectively, when the level in the blood is expected to be at its highest level. Random and ""trough"" anti-Xa tests may also be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone may not be clearing the drug at a normal rate. Trough tests are collected just prior to the next dose, when levels are expected to be at their lowest.



","



Heparin anti-Xa results must be evaluated in the context of the type of heparin that a person is receiving (UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux), the timing of the sample collection, and the condition that the person is being treated for. Results from different laboratories may not be interchangeable. Therapeutic reference intervals and the heparins that they are based on vary.
In general, for heparin therapy (UFH, LMWH or fondaparinux), if test results are within an established therapeutic range and the person is doing well clinically – not clotting, bleeding excessively, or experiencing other complications – then the dosage is considered appropriate.
If the heparin anti-Xa result is high, then the person may be getting an excessive dose and/or not be clearing the drug at an expected rate and may be at an increased risk for excessive bleeding.
If the heparin anti-Xa result is below the therapeutic range, then the dosage of heparin may need to be increased to prevent excessive clotting.



","



Because of differences in the methods used for measuring heparin anti-Xa and in the test results generated by various laboratories, samples for repeat anti-Xa testing should be sent to the same laboratory.

Heparin anti-Xa tests are sometimes used to monitor and adjust standard heparin (unfractionated heparin, UFH) therapy, though the primary monitoring tool for UFH is currently the PTT test. Heparin anti-Xa may be used to monitor some people who have ""heparin resistance"" who do not respond as expected to UFH or who have an underlying condition such as liver dysfunction or interfering factor(s) such as lupus anticoagulant (LAC) that affects the PTT test result.
Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and fondaparinux therapy is usually not monitored, but healthcare practitioners may order heparin anti-Xa tests in some cases. These include for women who are pregnant, people who are obese (more than 100 kg body weight), very young, or elderly and those who have kidney dysfunction. LMWH and fondaparinux are primarily cleared from the body by the kidneys. Any condition that decreases kidney function can decrease their clearance, increasing their concentration in the blood and increasing the potential for bleeding.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a complication of treatment with the blood-thinner (anticoagulant) heparin that can cause low platelets in the blood and an increased risk of excessive blood clotting. This test detects and measures antibodies that may be produced by your immune system when or after you are treated with heparin.
Heparin is a common anticoagulant that is given intravenously or through injections to prevent the formation of inappropriate blood clots (thrombosis) or as an initial treatment when you have a blood clot, to prevent the clot from enlarging. It is often given during some surgeries, such as heart surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass), when the risk for developing blood clots is high. Small amounts of heparin are frequently used to flush out catheters and intravenous lines to keep clots from forming in them.
Sometimes, when you are given heparin, the drug can combine with a substance found in platelets called platelet factor 4 (PF4) and form a complex. In some people, the body's immune system recognizes the heparin-PF4 complex as ""foreign"" and produces an antibody directed against it. This antibody in turn can activate your platelets and lead to a drop in the number of platelets, a condition known as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It may also lead to the development of new thrombosis or worsening thrombosis, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin use.
Platelets are cell fragments that are an important part of your blood clotting system. When a blood vessel is injured and leaks blood, platelets are activated and clump together at the site of the injury, and work with coagulation factors to promote clot formation and stop the bleeding.
Not everyone on heparin produces HIT antibodies, and not everyone with HIT antibodies develops a low platelet count, but about 1% to 5% of those with the antibodies do.

In HIT, the antibodies bind to the heparin-PF4 complexes, which then attach to the surface of platelets. If this happens, it activates your platelets, which in turn, triggers the release of more PF4.
This starts a cycle that can cause a rapid and significant drop (e.g., 50% or more) in the number of platelets in your blood.
Usually, a decrease in platelets results in a higher risk of bleeding, but in HIT, the activation of platelets by HIT antibodies can paradoxically lead to new and progressive blood clot formation in your veins and arteries.
This cycle occurs in about 30% to 50% of those who develop the HIT antibody and thrombocytopenia.

This condition, associated with the presence of HIT antibody, low platelet count, and excessive clotting, is formally called immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or HIT type II. If this happens, it typically develops about 5-10 days after you start heparin therapy but may also develop rapidly, within 1-2 days, if you have been treated with heparin in the last 3 months and start heparin treatment again.
There is also a non-immune mediated HIT (type I) that occurs when heparin binds directly to platelets, causing activation. It is more common than type II but is temporary and a milder form and is of no clinical significance.

When you are receiving heparin therapy and your platelet count significantly decreases (thrombocytopenia), especially when you also have new blood clots (thrombosis)


","



Since the development of HIT antibodies does not always lead to HIT II, testing is usually ordered only when HIT II is clinically suspected.
There is a pre-test scoring system that is typically used to determine your likelihood of having HIT II. It includes:

How low your platelet count has dropped (platelet decrease of 50% or more from before you were treated with heparin therapy)
The timing of the platelet count fall (typically 5-10 days after initial heparin use and within 2 days for a second use within 3 months of previous use)
The presence of new blood clots (thrombosis) and/or lesions at the heparin injection site
Ruling out other causes of low platelet count

The HIT antibody test is performed when this pre-scoring test shows that you have a moderate to high likelihood of having HIT II.
Typically, an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects HIT antibody is ordered as an initial test. Functional testing such as a serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin-induced platelet activation (HIPA) test may be ordered when the EIA test is indeterminate or negative but suspicion of HIT is still high.



","



The interpretation of HIT antibody results relies upon testing only people who have a moderate to high probability of having HIT II. Both false negatives and false positives can occur with this test and are more likely if you have a low probability of having HIT II.
If you have HIT antibodies, have been treated with heparin for 5 to 10 days, have a platelet count that has decreased by 50% or more, and have new blood clots, then it is likely that you have HIT II.
If you have HIT antibodies, have received heparin within the last 3 months and are experiencing significant thrombocytopenia within a day or two of re-starting heparin therapy, then it may also indicate HIT II.
If HIT testing is indeterminate, confirmatory testing is positive, and you have clinical signs of HIT, then it is likely that you have HIT II.
If the test is negative for HIT antibodies, then it is unlikely that you have HIT II. If confirmatory testing is performed and it is also negative, then it is likely that your symptoms are due to another cause.



",,"



A test for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) antibody, also called heparin-PF4 antibody, is performed to detect antibodies that develop in some people who have been treated with heparin. It is used to help establish a diagnosis of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT type II) when you have a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and excessive clotting (thrombosis).
Even if you have detectable HIT antibodies, you will not necessarily develop HIT II. Therefore, this test is most useful in those with a moderate to high likelihood of having HIT II, based upon the timing of heparin use, significantly low platelet count, and excessive blood clotting. The test is typically ordered along with or following a platelet count and may be followed by additional tests such as functional assays to help confirm a finding.
Functional assays, such as a serotonin release assay or heparin-induced platelet activation assay, are more specific for HIT II but take longer, are more technically demanding, and not widely available. These tests measure the effect your serum has on the function of ""normal"" platelets from healthy donors.

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV). It is one of several various causes of hepatitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and enlargement of the liver. This test detects antibodies in the blood that are produced by the immune system in response to a hepatitis A infection.
Hepatitis A is one of five ""hepatitis viruses"" identified so far, including B, C, D, and E, that are known to cause the disease. While hepatitis A can cause a severe, acute disease that typically lasts 1 to 2 months, it does not cause a chronic infection as do some of the other hepatitis viruses.
Hepatitis A is spread, most commonly, from person-to person through stool (fecal) contamination or by ingesting food or water contaminated by the stool of an infected person (a foodborne illness). Recognized risk factors for hepatitis A include close contact with an infected person, international travel, household or personal contact with a child who attends a child care center, household or personal contact with a newly arriving international adoptee, a recognized foodborne outbreak, men who have sex with men, and use of illegal drugs.
Although there are many causes of hepatitis, the symptoms remain the same. In hepatitis, the liver is damaged and unable to function normally. It cannot process toxins or waste products such as bilirubin for their removal from the body. During the course of the disease, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels in the blood can increase. While tests such as bilirubin or a liver panel can tell a healthcare practitioner that someone has hepatitis, they do not identify the cause. Antibody tests for hepatitis viruses may help determine the cause.
There are two different classes of hepatitis A antibody that may be tested, IgM and IgG. When a person is exposed to hepatitis A, the body first produces hepatitis A IgM antibodies. These antibodies typically develop 2 to 3 weeks after first being infected (and are detectable before the onset of symptoms) and persist for about 3 to 6 months. Hepatitis A IgG antibodies are produced within 1 to 2 weeks of the IgM antibodies and usually persist for life. (See below for more details.)
A vaccine that prevents hepatitis A has been available since 1995. Historically, infection rates varied cyclically, with nationwide increases every 10-15 years. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), hepatitis A rates have declined by more than 95% since the vaccine first became available. In 2015, the number of acute hepatitis A cases reported nationwide was an estimated 2,800.

Testing for the presence of IgM antibodies to hepatitis A is ordered when someone has acute symptoms such as:

Fever
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain
Dark urine and/or pale colored stool
Joint pain
Jaundice

In some people and in many young children, hepatitis A may not cause any symptoms. Children infected by HAV often have very mild symptoms, such as fever and diarrhea, and are often thought to have ""flu.""
An HAV test may also be ordered when a person is likely to have been exposed to the virus regardless of whether symptoms are present or not.

Results of hepatitis testing may indicate the following:



HAV IgM
HAV IgG or Total Antibody (IgM and IgG)
Results Indicate


Positive

Acute or recent HAV infection


Negative

No active infection but previous HAV exposure; has developed immunity to HAV or recently vaccinated for HAV


Not Performed
Positive
Has been exposed to HAV but does not rule out acute infection


Not Performed
Negative
No current or previous HAV infection; vaccine may be recommended if at risk



A total antibody test detects both IgM and IgG antibodies but does not distinguish between them.
If the total antibody test or hepatitis A IgG result is positive and someone has never been vaccinated against HAV, then the person has had past exposure to the virus. About 30% of adults over age 40 have antibodies to hepatitis A.



","



Hepatitis A vaccines are effective even when administered up to 15 days after exposure to the virus. Infants, immunocompromised people, people with chronic liver disease, or adults over 40 may be given an injection of immune globulin instead of the vaccine for post-exposure protection.
Although hepatitis A IgM antibodies are considered diagnostic for acute infection with hepatitis A, there has been increasing use of the test in people who do not have signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that the test only be used for persons who clinically have acute hepatitis to decrease the possibility of falsely positive results.



",,"



This test is used to help diagnose a liver infection due to the hepatitis A virus (HAV). There are several causes of hepatitis and the accompanying symptoms, so this test may be used to determine if the symptoms are due to hepatitis A.
A few different versions of the test may be used to detect different classes of hepatitis A antibodies.

The HAV IgM antibody test detects the first antibody produced by the body when it is exposed to hepatitis A. This test is used to detect early or recent infections and to diagnose the disease in people with symptoms of acute hepatitis. It may be performed as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel.
The HAV IgG test detects the IgG antibodies that develop later in the course of the disease. IgG antibodies remain present for many years, usually for life, providing protection against recurrent infection by the same virus. The IgG test is used to detect past HAV infections and may occasionally be used to determine if an individual has developed immunity from a previous infection (immune status), in which case a vaccine is not necessary.
The total HAV antibody test detects both IgM and IgG antibodies and thus may be used to identify both current and past infections. This test will also be positive after receiving the vaccine, so sometimes it may be used to determine whether a person has developed immunity after vaccination, though this practice is not advised. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) state that ""post-vaccination testing is not indicated because of the high rate of vaccine response among adults and children. In addition, not all testing methods approved for routine diagnostic use in the United States have the sensitivity to detect low anti-HAV concentrations after vaccination.""

In acute hepatitis, other tests such as bilirubin, liver panel, ALT, and AST may be performed with viral hepatitis tests to help diagnose the condition.

Hepatitis B is an infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B blood tests detect viral proteins (antigens), the antibodies that are produced in response to an infection, or detect or evaluate the genetic material (DNA) of the virus. The pattern of test results can identify a person who has a current active infection, was exposed to HBV in the past, or has immunity as a result of vaccination.
For details on the various tests, see the table under Common Questions: How is it used?
Hepatitis is a condition characterized by inflammation and, sometimes, enlargement of the liver. It has various causes, one of which is infection by a virus. HBV is one of five ""hepatitis viruses"" identified so far that are known to mainly infect the liver. The other four are hepatitis A, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and hepatitis E.
HBV is spread through contact with blood or other body fluids from an infected person. Exposure can occur, for example, through sharing of needles for IV drug use or through unprotected sex. People who live in or travel to areas of the world where hepatitis B is prevalent are at a greater risk. Mothers who are infected can pass the infection to their babies, usually during or after birth. The virus is not spread through casual contact such as holding hands, coughing or sneezing. However, the virus can survive outside the body for up to seven days, including in dried blood, and can be passed by sharing items such as razors or toothbrushes with an infected person.
Effective hepatitis B vaccines have been available in the U.S. since 1981, and beginning in 1991, healthcare providers in the U.S. began vaccinating infants at birth. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that between 850,000 and 2.2 million people in the U.S. are chronically infected with the virus, most of whom are not aware that they are infected.
The course of HBV infections can vary from a mild form that lasts only a few weeks to a more serious chronic form lasting years. Sometimes chronic HBV leads to serious complications such as cirrhosis or liver cancer. Some of the various stages or forms of hepatitis B include:

Acute infection — presence of typical signs and symptoms with a positive HBV test
Chronic infection — persistent infection with the virus detected by laboratory tests accompanied by inflammation of the liver
Carrier state — persistent infection (determined by HBV tests) but no liver inflammation (a carrier is someone who may appear to be in good health but harbors the virus and can potentially infect others)
Resolved or inactive infection — no longer has any evidence of infection; viral antigen and DNA tests are negative and no signs or symptoms of liver inflammation (although, in many cases, the virus is present in an inactive state in the liver and can potentially reactivate)
Reactivation — return of HBV infection (detected by HBV tests) with liver damage in a person who was a carrier or who had a resolved, inactive infection. This most commonly occurs in persons treated with chemotherapy for cancer or with drugs that suppress the immune system used to treat autoimmune diseases or following an organ transplant. It also can occur during treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) in people who also had been exposed to HBV in the past.

Though a potentially serious infection, acute HBV infection usually resolves on its own in most adults. Infants and children tend to develop a chronic infection more often than adults. Approximately 90% of infants infected with HBV will develop a chronic condition. For children between the ages of one and five, the risk of developing chronic hepatitis drops to between 25% and 50%. Over the age of five, less than 5% of HBV infections become chronic.
The vast majority of those with chronic infections will have no symptoms. For acute infections, the symptoms (when present) are very similar to those of other types of acute hepatitis, although no symptoms occur in over half of those with acute HBV infection. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. With acute hepatitis, the liver is damaged and is not able to function normally. It may not process toxins or waste products such as bilirubin for their removal from the body. During the course of disease, bilirubin and liver enzyme levels in the blood may increase. While tests such as bilirubin or a liver panel can tell a healthcare practitioner that someone has hepatitis, they will not indicate what is causing it. Tests that detect infection with a hepatitis virus may help determine the cause.

Hepatitis B tests may be ordered when someone has signs and symptoms associated with acute hepatitis to determine if they are due to infection with HBV. Some of these include:

Fever
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Abdominal pain
Dark urine
Pale stools
Joint pain
Jaundice

Hepatitis B tests may be done as follow up when routine tests results such as ALT and/or AST are elevated. Sometimes acute forms of hepatitis may be detected this way since they may cause only mild symptoms that can be confused with the flu. Chronic hepatitis more often has no symptoms and is more commonly detected when routine test results are abnormal.
A test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) may be used for screening when someone falls into one of the high-risk categories for chronic hepatitis B. Joint guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American College of Physicians were published in December 2017 and recommend the following groups be tested for HBsAg:

People born in areas of the world that have a greater than 2% prevalence of HbsAg (for example, much of Asia and Africa)
People born in the U.S. but who were not vaccinated and whose parents are from an area with greater than 8% prevalence of HbsAg
Men who have sex with men
People who have elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) with no known cause
People with certain medical conditions that require that their immune system be suppressed, such as organ transplant recipients
People with end-stage kidney disease
Pregnant women
Infants born to women with hepatitis B infection
People who live with a person with hepatitis B infection (household contact) or who have sexual partners with HBV
Those infected with HIV or HCV
Individuals living in correctional facilities
People who inject drugs
People who donate blood, plasma, tissue, organs or semen

When hepatitis B tests are used to monitor people with chronic hepatitis B infections, they may be performed on a regular basis. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), often along with HBV DNA, are usually measured about every 6 months to a year since, in some people, HBeAg (and, less commonly, HBsAg) will go away on their own. In those who are being treated for chronic HBV, HBeAg and HBV DNA tests can be used to determine whether the treatment is successful.

The tests for hepatitis B may be ordered individually but are often ordered in some combination, depending on the reason for testing. Results of the tests are typically evaluated together. Sometimes the meaning of one result depends on the result of another test. However, not all tests are performed for all people.

*Note: There are some types (strains) of HBV that do not make e-antigen. In areas where these strains of HBV are common (in the Middle East and Asia), testing for HBeAg is not very useful. In these cases, a negative HbeAg result does not necessarily mean that the person is not infectious; it may be that the person is infected with a strain that does not make the e-antigen.
Monitoring treatment of chronic infection: If the results from initial and follow-up testing indicate that a person has chronic hepatitis B, then the individual may be treated with medication and the effectiveness of that treatment may be monitored using the tests for HBe and HBs antigen and antibody and HBV DNA:

If HBsAg becomes negative and anti-HBs becomes positive during treatment, this usually indicates that treatment is effective and that treatment can be discontinued after an additional 6-12 months.
If HBeAg becomes negative and anti-HBe becomes positive during treatment, this usually indicates that it is effective and that treatment may be discontinued after an additional 6-12 months, although the virus may reappear later, so continued monitoring is needed.
HBV DNA measures the amount of virus present in the blood. A high result usually means that the virus is actively replicating and that treatment is not effective. A low result or one that is reported as below a lower limit (none detected) means the virus is not present or is present in such low numbers that it cannot be detected. This usually indicates that the therapy is effective in controlling replication of the virus; however, the virus may reappear if the treatment is stopped.




","



Even if you don't have symptoms, an HBV infection can damage your liver and you can spread the infection to others. For this reason, it is important to get tested if you think you have been exposed to HBV.
Blood banks screen all donated blood for the hepatitis B virus (HBV DNA), hepatitis B surface antigen (HbSAg), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc). Donors are notified of any confirmed positive reactions. People who receive a notice regarding possible infection with hepatitis B after donating should visit their healthcare provider for further testing. The healthcare practitioner will order additional tests to make a proper diagnosis and determine if treatment is necessary.
If exposed to HBV and you haven't been vaccinated, an infection can be avoided by getting a shot of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) within 24 hours and typically you will also be given the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.
A test is available to determine the specific type (strain) of hepatitis B virus that is causing a person's infection. This is called HBV genotyping. However, this testing is currently mainly used in research settings and not for clinical purposes.

The main uses for hepatitis B virus (HBV) tests include:

To determine whether acute signs and symptoms, such as jaundice, fever and fatigue, are due to hepatitis B infection; two tests, hepatitis B surface Ag and hepatitis B core antibody IgM, may be performed as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel along with tests for hepatitis A (HAV) and hepatitis C (HCV) to determine which virus may be causing the infection.
To diagnose chronic HBV hepatitis
To monitor chronic hepatitis B infection and its treatment
To detect a previous, resolved hepatitis B infection, in a person who is immune compromised (when the virus can become reactivated) or who has hepatitis C and in whom treatment is planned

Some of the secondary reasons to perform testing include: to screen for hepatitis B infection in at-risk populations or in blood donors, to determine if someone is a carrier, to detect a resolved infection, and to determine if immunity has developed due to vaccination.
Generally, one set of tests is used as an initial panel of tests to detect HBV infection or to determine the cause of acute symptoms while another set of tests may be used after a diagnosis is made to monitor possible progression of the disease, to detect chronic infection, and/or to determine carrier status.
The following table summarizes the set of tests typically used for initial testing:



Test
Description
Use and Comments


Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)
Detects protein that is present on the surface of the virus
To screen for, detect, and help diagnose acute and chronic HBV infections; earliest routine indicator of acute hepatitis B and frequently identifies infected people before symptoms appear; undetectable in the blood during the recovery period; it is the primary way of identifying those with chronic infections, including ""HBV carrier"" state.


Hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs)
Detects antibody produced in response to HBV surface antigen
Used to detect previous exposure to HBV; it can also develop from successful vaccination so it is used to determine the need for vaccination (if anti-HBs is absent) or to determine if a person has recovered from an infection and is immune (cannot get the infection again).


Total anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc, IgM and IgG)
Detects both IgM and IgG antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen
Can be used to help detect acute and chronic HBV infections; the IgM antibody is the first antibody produced after infection with HBV; IgG antibody is produced in response to the core antigen later in the course of the infection and usually persists for life.


Anti-hepatitis B core (anti-HBc, IgM)
Detects only the IgM antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen
Used to detect acute infections; may be included in initial testing, e.g., when done as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel



The following table summarizes tests that may be used as follow-up after initial tests detect an HBV infection:



Test
Description
Use and Comments


Hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAG)
Detects protein produced and released into the blood
Often used as a marker of ability to spread the virus to other people (infectivity); it may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. However, there are some types (strains) of HBV that do not make e-antigen; these are especially common in the Middle East and Asia. In areas where these strains of HBV are common, testing for HBeAg is not very useful to determine whether the virus can be spread to others.


Anti-hepatitis B e antibody (Anti-HBe)
Detects antibody produced by the body in response to the hepatitis B ""e"" antigen
Used to monitor acute infections in those who have recovered from acute hepatitis B infection; anti-HBe will be present along with anti-HBc and anti-HBs.


Hepatitis B viral DNA
Detects hepatitis B viral genetic material in the blood
A positive test indicates that the virus is multiplying in a person's body and that person is contagious. The test is often used to monitor the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in people with chronic HBV infections.


Hepatitis B virus resistance mutations
Detects mutations in the particular virus causing a person's infection that allows the virus to be resistant to treatments (reverse transcriptase inhibitors)
Helps to select appropriate treatment, especially in people who have been treated previously or in those who are not responding to treatment



While the tests described above are specific for HBV, other liver tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) may be used to monitor the progress of the disease. In some cases, a liver biopsy may be performed to evaluate how much damage has occurred to the liver.

Hepatitis C (HCV) is a virus that causes an infection of the liver that is marked by liver inflammation and damage. Hepatitis C tests are a group of tests that are performed to diagnose hepatitis C infection and to guide and monitor treatment of the infection.
Hepatitis C tests include:

HCV antibody test—detects antibodies in your blood that are produced in response to an HCV infection
HCV RNA test—detects and measures viral hepatitis C RNA in the blood
HCV genotype test—determines the specific subtype of the virus; this information is useful in guiding treatment.

Hepatitis C is one of five viruses identified so far, including A, B, D, and E, that are known to cause hepatitis.
HCV is spread when contaminated blood enters the body, primarily though sharing needles and syringes during IV drug use. HCV is spread less commonly by sharing personal items contaminated with blood (e.g., razors, toothbrushes), through sex with an infected person, needlestick injuries to healthcare workers, unregulated tattooing, and from mother to baby during pregnancy and childbirth. Before tests for HCV became available in the 1990s, HCV was often transmitted by blood transfusions. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C.

Acute hepatitis C—for some people, infection with HCV is a short-term illness, usually with few, mild symptoms or no symptoms, and the virus is cleared from the body without specific treatment. Occasionally (about 20 to 30% of the time), this acute stage of infection can cause more severe symptoms, particularly jaundice and fatigue.
Chronic hepatitis C—more than half of people infected develop chronic hepatitis C that, without treatment, can lead to serious, long-term health problems like cirrhosis and liver cancer, and may be fatal. Chronic hepatitis progresses slowly over time, so infected individuals may not be aware they have the condition until it causes enough liver damage to affect liver function.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there were approximately 44,700 cases of acute hepatitis C in the U.S. in 2017 and that there are 2.4 million people in the U.S. living with chronic hepatitis C. Many of these people don't know they are infected. The only way to know is to get tested for hepatitis C.
If you are diagnosed with hepatitis C, your healthcare practitioner may recommend an antiviral treatment to cure your infection or refer you to a healthcare practitioner who specializes in treating liver diseases or infectious diseases. The HCV RNA test may be repeated prior to starting treatment to determine whether the virus is still present and your infection persists, and also to provide a baseline to compare to during treatment.
There are several antiviral treatments available to treat hepatitis C. While some treat specific types (genotypes) of the virus, there are some that treat all genotypes. Treatment typically involves taking medication by mouth (oral) for about 8 to 12 weeks, although it can be longer in some cases. These medications can cure over 90% of people with chronic hepatitis C with relatively few side effects. Your infection is considered cured if you have no detectable HCV in your blood 12 weeks after completing treatment.

Have ever injected illegal drugs
Received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992*
Have received clotting factor concentrates produced before 1987
Were ever on long-term dialysis
Are a child born to HCV-positive women
Have been exposed to the blood of someone with hepatitis C
Are a healthcare, emergency medicine, or public safety worker who had needlesticks, sharps, or mucosal exposure to HCV-positive blood
Have evidence of chronic liver disease
Have HIV—about 21% of those with HIV are also infected with HCV (co-infection).

*The blood supply has been monitored in the U.S. since 1992, and any units of blood that test positive for HCV are rejected for use in another person. The current risk of HCV infection from transfused blood is about one case per two million transfused units.
Screening at regular intervals is recommended if you have ongoing risk of HCV infection, such as current injection drug use and sharing needles or syringes.
HCV antibody testing may be done when you have abnormal results on a liver panel or signs and symptoms associated with hepatitis and/or liver damage. In these cases, it may be done as part of an acute hepatitis panel. Most people newly infected with HCV have no symptoms or symptoms that are so mild that they rarely prompt a visit to a healthcare provider to get tested for HCV. However, about 10-20% of people may experience signs and symptoms such as:

Fatigue
Fever
Abdominal pain
Loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting
Dark urine
Light-colored stools
Yellowing of eyes and skin (jaundice)

An HCV RNA test (viral load) is ordered when:

You have a positive HCV antibody test to confirm an active infection; some laboratories will automatically perform this test if the HCV antibody test is positive.
There is strong suspicion that you have an early HCV infection or were exposed recently (e.g., within the last two months), regardless of HCV antibody results
You are treated for chronic hepatitis C, at the start of treatment and periodically to monitor your response, and about 12 weeks after finishing treatment to ensure the infection is cured

HCV genotype testing is done when you have been diagnosed with a chronic HCV infection and will begin treatment.



","



Screening and diagnosis
An HCV antibody test is typically reported as ""positive"" or ""negative.""
Results of HCV viral load testing are reported as a number of virus copies present. If no virus is present or if the amount of virus is too low to detect, the result is often reported as ""negative"" or ""not detected.""
Interpretation of the HCV screening and follow-up tests is shown in the table below.

In general, if your HCV antibody test is positive, then you have likely been infected at some time with hepatitis C.
If the laboratory reports results as weakly positive, most of these results are false positive and some laboratories will retest your sample with another test before reporting it as positive.
If your HCV RNA test is positive, then you have a current infection.
If no HCV viral RNA is detected, then you either do not have an active infection or the virus is present in very low numbers.




HCV Antibody

Interpretation


Negative
 
No infection or it is too soon after exposure and HCV antibody has not yet developed; if suspicion remains high, an HCV RNA test is done.


Negative
Positive
Early, acute HCV infection


Positive or weakly positive
Negative
Past infection or no infection (false-positive screen, most are weakly positive)


Positive
Positive
Current, active infection



Guiding and monitoring treatment
The result of your HCV genotype test identifies which strain of HCV you have and helps guide the selection and the length of your treatment. Treatments may differ depending on a variety of factors, including HCV genotype and the health of your liver.
An HCV viral load (HCV RNA quantitative) can indicate whether or not treatment is effective.

A high or increasing viral load may mean that treatment is not working.
A low, decreasing, or undetectable viral load likely means that the treatment is working.

Successful treatment usually leads to undetectable viral load after treatment is completed. According to guidelines from the AASLD and the IDSA, an undetectable viral load in your blood 12 weeks after the end of the treatment means that your HCV infection has responded to therapy.

The various hepatitis C tests have different uses:

An HCV antibody test is used to screen for past exposure and current infection. It detects the presence of antibodies to the virus in your blood that are produced by the immune system in response to infection. This test cannot distinguish whether you have an active or a previous HCV infection. There is some evidence that if your test is ""weakly positive,"" it may be a false positive. The CDC recommends that all positive antibody tests be followed by an HCV RNA test (see below) to determine whether or not you have an active infection.

	The HCV antibody test may be performed as part of an acute viral hepatitis panel to determine which of the most common hepatitis viruses is causing your symptoms.

HCV RNA test, Quantitative (HCV viral load) detects and measures the amount of viral RNA in your blood. This test may be used:
	
In follow up to a positive HCV antibody test to confirm the presence of the virus and diagnose an active infection
As an initial test for early, acute HCV infection or as follow-up to a negative antibody test if recent exposure is strongly suspected; this is because HCV antibodies may not develop for two months after exposure.
To help determine your response to therapy by comparing the amount of virus before, during, and after treatment


HCV RNA, Qualitative test is used to distinguish between a current or past infection. It is reported as a ""positive"" or ""detected"" if any HCV viral RNA is found. Otherwise, the report will be ""negative"" or ""not detected."" This test is not often used anymore.
Hepatitis C virus genotype is used to determine the kind, or genotype, of the HCV you have to help guide treatment. There are 6 major types of HCV and more than 50 subtypes identified. The most common, genotype 1, accounts for about 75% of cases in the U.S. The drugs selected for your treatment depend in part on the genotype of HCV causing your infection.

To determine whether a tumor is positive for particular HER2 (ERBB2) mutations, which helps to guide treatment and predict the course of the disease (prognosis); sometimes to monitor treatment and for cancer recurrence


","

A sample of tumor tissue is obtained by doing a fine needle aspiration, needle biopsy, or surgical biopsy (a tumor removed surgically)


","



HER2 is short for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. (It is also known as ERBB2). In some cancers, especially breast cancer or cancers of the stomach and esophagus (gastroesophageal), the tumor cells have extra copies of the gene and excess amounts of the protein that it produces. Tumors in this category are known as HER2-positive and can be more aggressive and respond differently to treatment than HER2-negative tumors. The HER2 test performed on tumor samples determines whether a person's cancer is HER2-positive.
In normal cells, the HER2 gene codes for a protein that helps promote cell growth. When a mutation results in too many copies within a cell (amplification), HER2 then produces too much of the HER2 protein, causing HER2 to act as an oncogene, meaning that it can promote uncontrolled, cancerous growth. This happens in about one in five breast cancers and can also occur in other cancers, such as stomach and esophagus cancers.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) jointly recommend that the tumors of all people with invasive or recurrent breast cancer be tested for HER2. Invasive breast cancer is cancer that has spread from the ducts or lobules to other parts of the breast or to immediately adjacent tissues or organs. Similarly, ASCO and CAP recommend that patients with certain stomach and esophagus cancers (inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) who may also benefit from HER2-targeted therapy have their tumor tissue tested.
To determine if a tumor is positive for HER2, a sample of tumor is tested. There are two established ways to test HER2 status:

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) measures the amount of HER2 protein present.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) looks at the gene level for the number of copies of the gene present; an increased number of gene copies is known as amplification.

Both IHC and FISH are acceptable testing methods for breast cancer. ASCO and CAP do not express a preference for one over the other, but if one test is equivocal (not clearly positive or negative), then the other should be done as a follow-up test for clarification of the result. For stomach and esophagus cancers, IHC is done first and FISH is reserved for follow-up clarification of equivocal IHC results.
An alternative testing method, chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH), is also available but isn't commonly used.

","



HER2 tissue testing is recommended along with other tests, such as estrogen and progesterone receptor status testing, as part of an initial workup of invasive breast cancer. Testing is also done when breast cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or when a person has been successfully treated but the cancer has come back (recurrent breast cancer). In its 2015 guidelines on biomarker testing of metastatic breast cancer, ASCO recommends offering HER2 testing to everyone with accessible metastases. However, there is not enough evidence to know if changing treatment based on the test will affect an individual's outcome in this setting.
HER2 tissue testing is also recommended for patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent, or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or esophagus who are candidates for HER2-targeted therapy.



","



Breast Cancer
HER2-positive breast cancer means the individual tested is likely to have a tumor that is aggressive, will respond poorly to endocrine treatment, and will be resistant to standard chemotherapy. The person may be considered a candidate for HER2-targeted therapy, such as trastuzumab, lapatinib or pertuzumab.
If HER2 testing is negative or equivocal by one method (IHC or FISH), then the other method is performed. If the second test is positive, the person still may benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.
If the tumor is HER2-negative, then HER2-targeted therapy isn't expected to be effective and the individual tested will avoid unnecessary side effects from treatment that is unlikely to help.
Stomach and esophagus cancers
Addition of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced cancers of the stomach and esophagus can result in improved survival and quality of life.
If HER2 testing is equivocal or negative by IHC, then FISH may be performed. If FISH is positive, then the person still may benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.
If the tumor is HER2-negative, then adding HER2-targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective.



","



Sometimes, results of testing for a sample are inadequate or inconclusive. In this case, repeat testing using another sample may be necessary.
HER2 testing is not available in every laboratory. Both IHC and FISH methods require experience and special training to perform and interpret. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) have recommended guidelines for HER2 testing to ensure accuracy. Your healthcare provider may send your sample to a reference laboratory and the results may take several weeks to return.
Certain HER2-positive tumors are susceptible to treatment with HER2-targeted drugs. HER2-targeted therapy may be used alone or with some other chemotherapy agents and is typically used to treat only people who have HER2-positive tumors. If the initial HER2-targeted drug is not effective in someone with a HER2-positive tumor, then the patient may be offered another drug also designed to target HER2.
A test that measures HER2 in one's blood is also available. At present there isn't wide consensus that it is as useful for most patients; therefore it isn't routinely recommended.



","



Breast tumor
After a person has been diagnosed with invasive or recurrent breast cancer, HER2 tissue testing is used to determine whether the tumor is HER2-positive. Someone with a HER2-positive tumor may benefit from HER2-targeted therapy.
Testing may also be used as a prognostic marker to help determine how aggressive the breast cancer is likely to be. It is not diagnostic but helps healthcare practitioners determine treatment options and understand more about the tumor's characteristics. Tumors that are HER2-positive tend to grow more aggressively and breast cancers with this abnormality resist endocrine (anti-hormone) therapy and some standard chemotherapies. People with HER2-positive breast cancers tend to have a poorer prognosis, but this tumor characteristic also makes them candidates to receive treatment specific for HER2-positive cancers, also known as targeted therapy.
HER2 testing is usually ordered along with estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor status tests (ER and PR). The results of these tests provide information about the person's likely prognosis and response to specific therapies, such as hormone therapy and chemotherapy.
Stomach and esophagus (gastroesophageal) tumor
For patients with inoperable, advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer of the stomach or esophagus who are candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, assessment of tumor HER2 overexpression is recommended to determine if trastuzumab (Herceptin) may be effective as part of their treatment.

To screen for and diagnose infection with a herpes simplex virus (HSV)


","

A healthcare practitioner uses a swab or spatula to collect a sample from a blister or sore in the affected area. A sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be collected using a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) when meningitis or encephalitis is suspected. For HSV antibody testing, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein.


","



Herpes is a common viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus exists as two main types, HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV testing identifies the presence of the virus in a sample from a blister, sore or fluid to diagnose an active herpes infection or testing detects antibodies in the blood to determine previous exposure to herpes.
Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are contagious and periodically cause small fever blisters (vesicles) that break to form open lesions.

HSV-1 primarily causes blisters or ""cold sores"" around the mouth (non-genital sites).
HSV-2 usually causes lesions around the genital area.

However, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can affect either the oral or genital areas.
The herpes simplex virus can be passed from person-to-person through skin contact while the sores are open and healing and sometimes when there are no visible sores. HSV-2 is the type most often spread during sex, but HSV-1 may also infect the genital area during oral sex.
Most people who have HSV-2 are unaware they are infected because signs and symptoms may be mild and go unnoticed.

When symptoms do appear, they may begin as painful blisters at the site of infection, usually within two weeks after infection.
The blisters can appear around the mouth, in the vaginal area, on the penis, around the anus, or on the buttocks or thighs.
The blisters generally heal within two to four weeks.
This primary episode can include a second outbreak of blisters and even flu-like symptoms such as fever and swollen glands.
However, not everyone develops blisters and sometimes symptoms are so mild that they are unnoticeable or mistaken for something else, such as insect bites or a rash.

Once you are infected and the initial infection resolves, the virus remains in your body in a latent form for the rest of your life. During periods of stress or illness, the virus may reactivate and you may have periodic outbreaks. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or those who have had an organ transplant, may have more frequent and serious outbreaks of HSV.
There is no cure for herpes, but antiviral medications such as acyclovir, famciclovir and valacyclovir can suppress outbreaks and shorten the duration of symptoms and active shedding of the virus.
Rarely, the virus can cause infections in newborns (neonatal herpes) when a mother transmits the virus to her baby during a vaginal delivery. Neonatal herpes symptoms appear during the first month of life. If left untreated, herpes can cause long-term health problems in the baby and can be life-threatening. A pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with herpes may be monitored regularly prior to delivery to detect a reactivation of her infection.
A HSV infection can spread to the brain, causing encephalitis. This illness can be fatal or cause serious, permanent neurological problems in those who survive.
Herpes may be tested a few different ways:
Direct detection of the virus
The preferred methods of testing for the virus in people with active blisters or sores are the herpes culture and HSV PCR testing. PCR testing is the preferred method if encephalitis or neonatal herpes are suspected.

HSV DNA PCR (NAAT)—this method detects HSV genetic material in a sample from the blister, blood, or other fluid, such as spinal fluid. PCR can detect the virus as well as identify the type of herpes virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2). This method is more sensitive than culture and is becoming more widely available.
Herpes culture—a sample of fluid is collected from an open sore using a swab and cultured. If the culture is positive, the virus can be further identified as HSV-1 or HSV-2.

Antibody testing
HSV antibody (serologic) testing detects immune proteins called immunoglobulin G (IgG) in your blood that the body produces in response to a herpes infection. HSV antibody testing can detect both HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies as well as differentiate between them.

When you have symptoms of viral meningitis such as fever, persistent headache, stiff neck
A pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with herpes may be monitored regularly prior to delivery.
A newborn from a mother who has active blisters may be tested soon after delivery to assess the risk of transmission from mother to baby during delivery.
A newborn may also be tested soon after delivery when the baby shows signs of HSV infection, such as meningitis or skin lesions that could be caused by the herpes virus.



","



HSV PCR testing or herpes culture may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of a herpes infection, such as a blister or blisters (vesicles) on or around your eye, mouth, genitals or rectum.
Herpes PCR testing may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of encephalitis that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be caused by a virus. Examples of these signs and symptoms include:

Fever
Severe persistent headache
A stiff neck
Sensitivity to light
Mental changes
Lethargy

Prenatal and newborn testing

A pregnant woman who has been diagnosed with herpes may be monitored regularly prior to delivery to detect a reactivation of her infection.
A baby born to a mother who has active lesions during delivery may be tested before symptoms appear to assess whether the baby was exposed to HSV during delivery.
A mother and newborn may be tested for HSV soon after delivery when a baby shows signs of HSV infection, such as meningitis or skin lesions that could be caused by the herpes virus.

HSV antibody testing may be done when your healthcare practitioner wants to determine if you have been exposed to HSV in the past.



","



Direct detection of the virus

A positive HSV DNA (PCR) test or culture indicates that you have an active herpes infection, and the result may indicate if it is HSV-1 or HSV-2.
A negative PCR test or culture indicates that the herpes simplex virus was not detected, but this does not definitely rule out an infection. False negatives can occur if there is not enough active virus in the sample. This may happen if the lesion is cultured more than 48 hours after the symptoms appear. If suspicion of herpes remains high, repeat testing may be done.

Antibody blood tests

A positive HSV-1 or HSV-2 IgG antibody test means antibodies are present in your blood, which means you have had an infection in the past even if you haven't noticed any symptoms. The type of antibody detected indicates the type of HSV infection.
Negative HSV antibody results mean that it is unlikely that you have been exposed to HSV or it may mean that your body has not had time to begin producing HSV antibodies.




","



Herpes can make people more susceptible to HIV infection. The skin lesions give other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV, openings for entering the body. Likewise, it can make HIV-infected individuals more infectious. Infection with HSV can also increase HIV viral load. HSV-2 infection is a significant opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals due to immune system deficiencies; up to 90% of HIV-infected individuals are co-infected with HSV-2.



","



Herpes testing may be used a few different ways:

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR testing or culture may be used to diagnose an active herpes infection if you have signs and symptoms, such as genital sores or encephalitis.
HSV PCR is the preferred test to diagnose newborns suspected of having neonatal herpes, a rare but serious condition in which herpes is contracted during vaginal birth.
HSV antibody testing may be used to determine whether you have been exposed to HSV in the past. This may be helpful in screening certain populations, such as potential organ transplant recipients. It may also be useful for pregnant women to help determine the risk of them passing an HSV-2 infection to their baby.
PCR and antibody testing may be used to distinguish between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend screening for herpes in the general population, but it may be helpful in some cases, such as:

If you have signs and symptoms, such as genital sores that may be related to herpes
If you have or had a sex partner with genital herpes
If you would like to have a complete exam for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), especially if you have multiple sex partners; if this is the case, you should discuss STD testing with your healthcare practitioner.

No test preparation is needed; however, you may be instructed to fast for 9-12 hours before the blood sample is taken if a lipid panel also is going to be done at the same time.

To help assess your risk of developing cardiovascular disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein that increases in the blood with inflammation and infection as well as following a heart attack, surgery, or trauma. Studies have suggested that a persistent low level of inflammation plays a major role in atherosclerosis, the narrowing of blood vessels due to build-up of cholesterol and other lipids, which is often associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The hs-CRP test accurately measures low levels of CRP to identify low but persistent levels of inflammation and thus helps predict a person's risk of developing CVD.
There are two different tests that measure CRP and each test measures a different range of CRP level in the blood for different purposes:

The standard CRP test measures markedly high levels of the protein to detect diseases that cause significant inflammation. It measures CRP in the range from 10 to 1000 mg/L. This test may be used to detect inflammation (see the article C-Reactive Protein).
The hs-CRP test accurately detects lower levels of the protein than the standard CRP test. It measures CRP in the range from 0.5 to 10 mg/L. This test is used to evaluate individuals for risk of CVD.

CVD causes more deaths in the U.S. each year than any other cause, according to the American Heart Association. A number of risk factors, such as family history, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, being overweight or diabetic, have been linked to the development of CVD, but a significant number of people who have few or no identified risk factors will also develop CVD. This fact has lead researchers to look for additional risk factors that might be either causing CVD or that could be used to determine lifestyle changes and/or treatments that could reduce a person's risk.
High-sensitivity CRP is one of a growing number of cardiac risk markers that are used to help determine a person's risk. Some studies have shown that measuring CRP with a highly sensitive assay can help identify the risk level for CVD in apparently healthy people. This more sensitive test can measure CRP levels that are within the higher end of the reference range. These normal but slightly high levels of CRP in otherwise healthy individuals can predict the future risk of a heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death, and peripheral arterial disease, even when cholesterol levels are within an acceptable range.
hs-CRP could be a marker not only in apparently healthy people, recent studies have shown. Adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) with elevated CRP have worse functional status and exercise capacity, greater risk for death, or non-elective cardiovascular hospitalization.

","

No current consensus exists on when to get tested; hs-CRP is often ordered in conjunction with other tests that are performed to assess risk of heart disease, such as a lipid panel (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C) when your healthcare provider would like additional information on your risk.


","



Currently, there is no consensus on when to get tested, though some guidelines include recommendations on hs-CRP testing. For example, a guideline from the American College of Cardiology Foundations and the American Heart Association says that hs-CRP testing may be useful when men 50 years old or younger and women 60 years old or younger have intermediate risk. It also may be useful for treatment decisions when men and women are older than these respective ages and have LDL-C less than 130 mg/L and meet several other criteria, such as no existing heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, or inflammatory conditions.
When hs-CRP is evaluated, it may be repeated to confirm that a person has persistent low levels of inflammation. The CDC and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that measurement of hs-CRP greater than 10 mg/L be repeated twice, optimally two weeks apart, fasting or non-fasting in patients free of infection or acute illness.



","



Relatively high levels of hs-CRP in otherwise healthy individuals have been found to be predictive of an increased risk of a future heart attack, stroke, sudden cardiac death, and/or peripheral arterial disease, even when cholesterol levels are within an acceptable range.
People with higher hs-CRP values have the highest risk of cardiovascular disease and those with lower values have less risk. Specifically, individuals who have hs-CRP results at the high end of the normal range have 1.5 to 4 times the risk of having a heart attack as those with hs-CRP values at the low end of the normal range.
The American Heart Association and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have defined risk groups as follows:

Low risk: less than 1.0 mg/L
Average risk: 1.0 to 3.0 mg/L
High risk: above 3.0 mg/L

These values are only a part of the total evaluation process for cardiovascular diseases. Additional risk factors to be considered are elevated levels of cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, and glucose. In addition, smoking, high blood pressure (hypertension), and diabetes also increase the risk level.



","



Taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) or statins may reduce CRP levels in blood. Both anti-inflammatory drugs and statins may help to reduce inflammation, thus reducing CRP.
Women on hormone replacement therapy have been shown to have elevated hs-CRP levels.
Since the hs-CRP and CRP tests measure the same protein, people with chronic inflammation, such as those with arthritis, should not have hs-CRP levels measured. Their CRP levels will already be very high due to the arthritis, so results of the hs-CRP test will not be meaningful.



","



A high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) test measures low levels of CRP and may be used to help evaluate an individual for risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It may be used in combination with a lipid panel or with other cardiac risk markers, such as a lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) test, to provide added information about heart disease risk.
This test is different than the standard CRP test that is used to detect inflammation. For details, see the article on C-Reactive Protein (CRP).
High-sensitivity CRP is thought by some experts to be a useful test for determining risk of CVD, heart attacks, and strokes and that hs-CRP can play a role in the evaluation process before a person develops one of these health problems. Some say that the best way to predict risk is to combine a good marker for inflammation, like hs-CRP, with the lipid panel. Several groups have recommended that this test be used for people who have a moderate risk of heart attack over the next 10 years.
However, not all health professionals agree on hs-CRP's usefulness. Clinical trials that involve measuring hs-CRP levels are currently underway in an effort to better understand its role in cardiovascular events. These studies will help to form and refine guidelines on its use in screening and treatment decisions.
Recently, the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) concluded in their ""Risk Assessment for Cardiovascular Disease With Nontraditional Risk Factors: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement"" that there was no evidence that adding hs-CRP will benefit nor harm the traditional risk assessment for cardiovascular diseases in asymptomatic adults to prevent CVD event and initiation of preventative therapy.

None for anaphylaxis, but timing of the sample very soon after the beginning of symptoms is important. If testing is done for other conditions, you may be instructed to refrain from taking antihistamine and other medications. This should be discussed with your healthcare practitioner.

To help confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis, mastocytosis, or mast cell activation


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a 24-hour urine collection


","



Histamine is a substance that is released from specialized cells called mast cells when they are activated, often as part of an allergic immune response. This test measures the amount of histamine in the blood or urine.
Mast cells are large tissue cells found throughout the body. They are present mainly in the skin, the lining of the intestine and air passages, and the bone marrow. Mast cells are part of the body's normal response to injury as well as allergic (hypersensitivity) responses. They contain granules that store a number of chemicals, including histamine and tryptase, which are released when mast cells become activated. Histamine is responsible for many of the symptoms in persons with allergies.
Concentrations of histamine in the blood and urine are normally very low. Significant increases can be seen in people with a severe allergic reaction and in those with a disorder in which the number of mast cells increase (proliferate) and/or activate without apparent allergies.
The activation of many mast cells is associated with a severe form of acute allergic reaction termed anaphylaxis, which can cause hives (blisters on the skin), reddening of the skin (flushing), low blood pressure, severe narrowing of the air passages, and even death. With anaphylaxis, histamine concentrations in the blood increase rapidly, rising within 10 minutes of the start of symptoms and returning to normal within about 30 to 60 minutes. This increased production is also reflected a short time later in the urine as histamine and its primary metabolite, N-methylhistamine, are excreted.
Histamine and tryptase levels may be persistently increased in people with mastocytosis. This rare condition is associated with abnormal proliferation of mast cells and their infiltration and accumulation in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) and/or in organs throughout the body (systemic mastocytosis).
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. For a 24-hour urine collection, all of the urine should be saved for a 24-hour period. It is best to keep the sample in a cool, dark place such as a refrigerator.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
If anaphylaxis is suspected, it is important to collect the sample very soon after the beginning of symptoms. If testing is done for other conditions, you may be instructed to refrain from taking antihistamine and other medications. This should be discussed with your healthcare practitioner.

When you have symptoms such as flushing, nausea, throat swelling or low blood pressure that may be due to a life-threatening allergic reaction; sometimes when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have mastocytosis or mast cell activation


","



Histamine is not a frequently ordered test. Anaphylaxis is usually diagnosed without testing for histamine or tryptase, and mastocytosis is rare. Histamine and tryptase tests are sometimes ordered when a person has symptoms that suggest anaphylaxis, especially when the diagnosis is not clear and/or the symptoms are recurrent. Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

Difficulty breathing, wheezing
Flushing
Itching, often with visible hives
Light-headedness or dizziness
Low blood pressure
Swelling of the throat, face, tongue, and/or eyes

Many of these symptoms are also seen with other conditions.
Testing may also be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person may have mastocytosis or a mast cell activation disorder. People with these disorders have many of the same symptoms and signs as persons with severe allergies, but without any specific trigger, such as exposure to certain foods (e.g., peanuts) or a bee sting. Persons with systemic mastocytosis may have signs and symptoms such as peptic ulcers, chronic diarrhea, joint pain, enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes, rashes or characteristic red, blistering lesions that may be present singly or by the hundreds.



","



Significantly elevated histamine and/or tryptase levels in a person with symptoms of anaphylaxis are strong evidence for that diagnosis.
Normal histamine results may indicate that a person's symptoms are due to another cause, or that the sample was not collected at the right time. With anaphylaxis, blood histamine levels rise rapidly and can fall back to normal within about 30-60 minutes. If a sample is drawn too late, results may be normal. If a tryptase test is also performed, its value can be compared to the histamine levels. Tryptase levels rise and fall more slowly than histamine levels, peaking within 1 to 2 hours of symptom development.
If the timing of sample collection was appropriate and neither the blood histamine or tryptase concentration is elevated, it is less likely that a person had anaphylaxis. However, a person can have anaphylaxis or mastocytosis without elevated histamine levels, so the diagnosis cannot be ruled out just because the test is negative.
Increased levels of histamine and/or N-methylhistamine in a 24-hour urine sample indicate an event associated with mast cell activation. Persistently elevated histamine and/or tryptase levels in a person with mastocytosis symptoms make it likely that the person has this condition. The diagnosis must still be confirmed with other testing.



","



Histamine may be elevated with any condition that activates mast cells, and the release of histamine may be triggered by a wide variety of substances.
An allergic reaction to a food is thought to be the most common cause of anaphylaxis.
In some people, histamine-related symptoms, such as flushing, headache, diarrhea, itching, etc., may develop after eating histamine-rich foods. Histamine can be found in a variety of foods, especially those that are ""aged"" such as cheese, wine, and sauerkraut. Symptoms may also be caused by ingesting alcohol, or by drugs that either stimulate the release of histamine or block its metabolism.
Rarely, histamine poisoning can occur by eating fish that has spoiled (e.g., tuna, mackerel) and has high quantities of bacteria-produced histamine. Called scombroid fish poisoning, this condition can cause flushing, sweating, vomiting, headache, and diarrhea.
Some carcinoid tumors located within the digestive tract produce excess histamine.



",,"



The histamine test is a useful indicator of mast cell activation. The test may be used to help confirm that a person has had an anaphylactic reaction, or it may be used to help diagnose mastocytosis, a rare group of disorders characterized by abnormal proliferation of mast cells.
Anaphylaxis is usually diagnosed clinically, but a histamine test may be used along with a tryptase test to help confirm anaphylaxis as the cause of someone's acute symptoms. This is especially true if the person has recurrent episodes and/or if the diagnosis is uncertain. A blood histamine test must be collected rapidly, as soon as symptoms develop.
Instead of a blood test, a histamine test performed on urine collected over a 24-hour period may be ordered instead to evaluate histamine production over a longer time frame. In some cases, the metabolite N-methylhistamine may be measured in urine instead of histamine.
Histamine testing may sometimes be ordered along with a tryptase test to help diagnose mastocytosis or mast cell activation disorder. Cutaneous mastocytosis typically only causes skin problems (particularly hives). People with systemic mastocytosis or mast cell activation disorder may experience anaphylaxis and its associated symptoms.

Histone antibodies are autoantibodies. These are antibodies produced by a person's own immune system that target his or her own histones. Histones are proteins that are a part of chromatin, the genetic material present in the nucleus of almost all cells within the body. Because histones are found inside cells, this attack on ""self"" can cause symptoms throughout the body. This test detects the presence of histone antibodies in the blood.
Histone autoantibodies are one of several types of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). ANA are associated with a variety of autoimmune disorders. The presence or absence of specific antinuclear antibodies is used to help determine which disorder a person may have.
Drugs can stimulate the production of histone antibodies in some people and can cause a type of lupus called drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Up to 95% of those with drug-induced lupus will have histone antibodies. The autoantibodies may also develop in up to 50% of those with non-drug-induced lupus and in 20% of those with other connective tissue diseases.
Many drugs have been associated with drug-induced lupus in some people. Some of the more common examples include:

Hydralazine
Isoniazid
Minocycline
Penicillamine
Procainamide
Quinidine

Other types of medications associated with drug-induced lupus include:

Antibiotics
Anti-seizure medications
Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents
Interferon-alpha
Blood pressure medications
Methyldopa
Thyroid medications

When you have symptoms associated with lupus that may be due to a drug that you are taking


","



A histone antibody test is ordered when a person has been taking a drug for several weeks to a couple of years and develops signs and symptoms that could be due to drug-induced lupus. This is especially true when the person affected did not have a prior personal or family history of an autoimmune disorder. Symptoms may include:

Arthritis-like pain in one or more joints (but no or little joint inflammation)
Fatigue
Fever
Muscle pain (myalgia)
Red rash that frequently resembles a butterfly across the nose and cheek areas (malar rash)
Sensitivity to sunlight
Weight loss
	 

Symptoms and complications involving the central nervous system (CNS) and kidneys occur with SLE but are much rarer with drug-induced lupus.
The histone antibody test may be repeated at intervals after the drug has been discontinued to monitor for decreases in histone antibody levels.



","



Results of histone antibody testing consider several factors. A positive result means that a person likely has drug-induced lupus if the person also has:

Symptoms associated with lupus
Been taking a drug, especially one associated with the condition, for several weeks to a couple of years
No identified autoimmune disorder prior to taking the drug
Positive ANA test
Low or negative anti-dsDNA and other autoantibodies
Signs and symptoms that resolve when the drug is discontinued
Histone antibody levels that begin to decrease when the drug is discontinued
	 

A positive histone antibody result by itself does not establish a diagnosis. About 50% of those with SLE will have histone antibodies, though generally not induced by a specific drug. In these cases, the anti-dsDNA test will be positive and significantly elevated.
A negative result means that the individual's signs and symptoms may be due to a condition other than drug-induced lupus, such as a drug allergy. However, a negative result does not rule out drug-induced lupus. A small portion of individuals may have drug-induced lupus even if they do not have histone antibodies.



","



An individual with SLE may have a flare-up that is caused or exacerbated by drug therapy without having drug-induced lupus.
SLE tends to affect more women than men and tends to occur in people in their 20s to 40s. Drug-induced lupus affects both sexes equally and can affect anyone but occurs most frequently in those who are older.



","



Histone antibody testing is primarily used to support a diagnosis of drug-induced lupus, particularly in a person who is taking one of the medications mentioned above in the ""What is being tested?"" section.
Testing is used to distinguish drug-induced lupus from other forms of lupus such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), from another autoimmune disorder, or from another cause of a person's symptoms. While it is not diagnostic of drug-induced lupus, its presence is consistent with this diagnosis.
The test is typically ordered with or following a positive ANA test and may be ordered along with a test for anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) to help establish a diagnosis.
If a person is diagnosed with drug-induced lupus, the identified drug may be discontinued upon the recommendation of the healthcare practitioner. One or more histone antibody tests may be used as follow up to monitor antibody levels (titers), if present.

If you have been diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), to determine whether the strain causing your infection is resistant or has developed resistance to one or more antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genotypic antiretroviral drug resistance testing evaluates the likelihood that the HIV strain infecting you is resistant or has developed resistance to one or more antiretroviral therapy (ART) drugs. The test analyzes the genes of the HIV strain infecting you to identify mutations that may cause the virus to be resistant to ART.
ART is intended to suppress the amount of HIV virus (viral load) in order to decrease the risk of the disease progressing. However, you may be initially infected with a drug-resistant HIV strain or drug resistance may develop during treatment, causing ART to be ineffective in suppressing the virus.
In general, drug resistance describes the condition in which a microbe (e.g., virus, bacteria) is able to survive, grow and/or multiply in the presence of one or more antimicrobial drugs. Resistance can develop when antimicrobials are used to treat an infection and a mutation or change occurs in one of the microbe's genes. This change leads to a mixed population in your body – some microbes that are drug-resistant and some that are drug-sensitive. Microbes without the mutation are killed, but those that have the mutation quickly multiply and begin to predominate. This is called ""selective pressure"" because the drug ""selects"" and allows the growth of the microbes that are resistant to it. When this occurs, the antimicrobial is no longer effective in treating your infection.
HIV mutates frequently – even in the absence of drug treatment – but not every mutation causes resistance to ART. With genotypic resistance testing, the genetic code of the HIV you have been infected with is analyzed to determine if there are any genetic mutations that are known to cause ART resistance.
To avoid the development of ART resistance, it is recommended that individuals with HIV be treated with a combination of drugs that are from two different classes of antiretroviral drugs. This is known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART. There are many different antiretroviral drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For more on this, visit the National Institute of Health's web page on FDA-Approved HIV Medicines.

When first diagnosed with HIV, immediately prior to the start of antiretroviral therapy, or when you are receiving ART but the amount of virus in your blood (HIV viral load) does not decrease or rises steadily


","



HIV genotypic resistance testing is recommended when you are first diagnosed with an HIV infection and before starting therapy. If treatment is not started soon after diagnosis, then it is recommended that resistance testing be repeated before starting therapy.
Testing may also be ordered when your HIV viral load values do not decrease or they rise steadily during therapy, indicating that your HIV may be developing resistance. Generally, your treatment is considered a failure if your viral load rises more than three-fold in consecutive tests.



","



In general, the mutations detected by the test indicate the drugs to which the HIV strain is likely to be resistant. However, not all mutations cause drug resistance and the results of genotypic resistance testing must be interpreted with caution. A specialist may be consulted when considering results of your test and selecting appropriate ART.
The test results identify the HIV viral mutations detected. These are described by a combination of letters and numbers where the letters refer to the amino acid associated with the HIV gene and the number refers to the position of the mutation in the HIV's genome. For example, the mutation K103N may be detected. K is the amino acid and 103 is the position of the mutation.
The laboratory report may also provide an interpretation and a list of the drugs to which the virus is either resistant or susceptible. This information helps a healthcare practitioner select a treatment regimen that is likely to be effective in suppressing your HIV. If you are being treated with ART and the test results indicate that the HIV strain has become resistant to it, you will likely be switched to a new treatment regimen.



","



HIV genotypic resistance testing cannot detect unknown resistance mutations that may be present in rare strains of HIV. The test may not detect a drug-resistant strain of HIV if the resistant gene is only present in less than 10-20% of total virus that is circulating in the blood.
Testing is not recommended after discontinuing a drug. This is because the percentage of drug-resistant strain may decrease considerably in the absence of the drug. When ""selective pressure"" from a drug is absent, the drug-resistant strain may drop enough to the point where testing would not be able to detect it. Because of this, if testing is performed to evaluate a failed treatment, it should be done while a person is taking the drugs, or if this is not possible, then within 4 weeks of stopping therapy.



","



HIV genotypic antiretroviral resistance testing is used to help select a drug regimen that will likely be effective in treating your HIV infection. The test is used to determine whether the HIV strain infecting you is resistant or has developed resistance to one or more drugs used to treat HIV. Testing analyzes the genes of the virus to detect the presence of one or more mutations that are associated with antiretroviral drug (ART) resistance.

When you are first diagnosed, HIV drug resistance testing is used to determine whether the HIV strain is already resistant to one or more drugs. The information is used to identify and select the antiretroviral drugs that will likely be effective.
Testing may also be used after you begin treatment to help determine the cause of drug treatment failure. Treatment failure is identified when your HIV viral load does not decrease or begins to increase despite treatment. In this case, your treatment will likely be changed. Results of antiretroviral resistance testing may help select a different drug regimen that may be effective in suppressing the virus.

Testing is used to identify resistance to antiretroviral drugs in classes such as:

Protease inhibitors
Reverse transcriptase inhibitors
Integrase inhibitors

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This test measures the amount (viral load) of HIV genetic material (RNA) in your blood.
When you are initially infected with HIV, the virus replicates — it produces more and more copies of itself. The main target of HIV is the CD4 cells, which are a type of white blood cell that fights infections. The virus enters these cells and uses them to replicate and spread throughout your body. It moves into your lymph nodes, spleen, and other parts of your body.
In the early stages of infection, there may not be any noticeable signs or symptoms of disease or only flu-like symptoms, although the virus is usually present in high amounts. Without treatment and even when there are no symptoms, the virus continues to replicate and the viral load will increase. HIV kills your CD4 cells, so the number of CD4 cells will decrease as HIV infection progresses.
About 3-8 weeks after initial exposure to the virus, your immune system begins to produce HIV antibodies in response to the infection and suppresses the HIV viral load, decreasing it to a low level. Initial symptoms typically resolve, but your infection does not go away.
The only way to determine whether you have been infected is through HIV testing. If not detected early and treated, an HIV infection may slowly degrade your immune system. After several years and without treatment, the immune system can become so weakened that the disease begins to affect your ability to fight infections and certain cancers. Symptoms of AIDS begin to appear at this stage as your body becomes more susceptible to infections with microorganisms such as tuberculosis and fungi or other diseases such as Kaposi's sarcoma.
When you are diagnosed, you are given antiretroviral treatments for HIV (also called highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART) to suppress the amount of HIV virus present in your blood, limiting its ability to replicate and reducing the risk of progressing to AIDS. Evidence shows that keeping the viral load at undetectable levels decreases your risk of progressing to AIDS and greatly improves your long-term health. If you have HIV and discontinues treatment or if it loses its effectiveness, then your HIV viral load can begin to increase again.
The HIV RNA test detects HIV virus genetic material and measures how many copies of HIV (viral load) are present in your blood at a particular time. It can track increases and decreases in your HIV viral load and, in conjunction with a CD4 count, be used to evaluate treatment effectiveness.

When first diagnosed with HIV; 2 to 8 weeks after the start of therapy or therapy changes, then every 4 to 8 weeks until the viral load is not detectable; then every 3 to 4 months if you are on stable therapy and the virus remains suppressed; after two years of this, viral load testing frequency may be decreased to every 6 months.


","



An HIV viral load test is typically ordered with a CD4 count when you are first diagnosed with HIV infection as part of a baseline measurement. After the baseline, a viral load test will usually be ordered at intervals over time, depending on a few different factors.
The following table summarizes recommendations* for the timing of viral load testing and CD4 counts:



Your Clinical Status
Viral Load
CD4 Count


When first diagnosed
Test performed
Test performed


After initiating ART
Within 2-4 weeks and then every 4-8 weeks until virus is suppressed (undetectable)
3 months later


During the first 2 years of stable ART
Every 3-4 months
Every 3-6 months


After 2 years of stable ART, virus undetectable, and CD4 greater than 300 cells/mm3
Can extend to every 6 months
Annually; if CD4 consistently greater than 500 cells/mm3, monitoring is optional


After changing ART due to side effects or simplifying drug regimen when your virus is suppressed
After 4-8 weeks, to confirm drug effectiveness
Monitor according to prior CD4 count and the amount of time you have been on ART, as detailed above


After changing ART due to increased viral load (treatment failure)
Within 2-4 weeks and then every 4-8 weeks until virus undetectable
Every 3-6 months


While on ART and viral load is consistently greater than 200 copies/mL
Every 3 months
Every 3-6 months


With new HIV symptoms or start of new treatment with interferon, corticosteroids or cancer drugs
Every 3 months
Perform test and monitor according to health status (e.g., new HIV symptoms, opportunistic infections)



*Adapted from Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in HIV-1–Infected Adults and Adolescents, Table 4. Recommendations on the Indications and Frequency of Viral Load and CD4 Count Monitoring.



","



HIV viral load tests are reported as the number of HIV copies in a milliliter (copies/mL) of blood.
If your viral load measurement is high, it generally indicates that HIV is present and replicating. Initial, untreated, and uncontrolled HIV viral loads can range as high as one million or more copies/mL.
If you are receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART), a high viral load means that the treatment is not effective. If you are not responding to treatment, then it will likely be changed. You should undergo HIV drug resistance testing to help in the selection of an alternative therapy.
Viral loads that are consistently less than 200 copies/mL indicate that your virus is adequately suppressed and that the risk of disease progression is low. Nevertheless, an undetectable viral load in someone who has a diagnosed HIV infection does not mean that your HIV infection is cured. It means only that the level of your HIV RNA is currently below the threshold needed for detection by the test.
Changes in your viral load can often be more important during HIV monitoring than a single test result. An increasing viral load indicates either that your infection is getting worse or that your virus has developed resistance to the drugs that are being used for therapy and are no longer effective. A decreasing viral load indicates improvement, treatment effectiveness, and suppression of your HIV infection.



",,"



The HIV viral load test is used initially, along with a CD4 count, to determine the status of your HIV infection when you have been diagnosed with the disease. The viral load is then used to monitor the effectiveness of your antiretroviral treatment (ART) over time.
The HIV viral load may also be used to help determine whether the virus infecting you has become drug-resistant. If you do not respond well to treatment and the amount of virus continues to increase, then the virus may be resistant to that particular ART. Your treatment will then likely be modified.
HIV viral load tests are most useful when they are compared with results obtained from your earlier tests. They are used in combination with the CD4 count to monitor how effective ART is in suppressing your HIV. (For more details, see the article on the CD4 Count.)

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



HLA-B27 is a specific protein (termed a human leukocyte antigen or HLA) that is found on cell surfaces. The term HLA-B27 is also used to refer to the gene that codes for the HLA-B27 protein. The HLA-B27 test determines the presence or absence of HLA-B27 protein on the surface of a person's white blood cells.
Human leukocyte antigens are proteins that help the body's immune system identify its own cells and distinguish between ""self"" and ""nonself."" Everyone has an inherited combination of HLA genes that code for the many antigens present on the surfaces of their cells. The presence or absence of each antigen creates a distinctive HLA combination for each person.
HLA-B27 is found in about 6% of the U.S. population. People with HLA-B27 have an increased likelihood of developing autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis (AS), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), reactive arthritis (of which one subset is Reiter syndrome), and isolated acute anterior uveitis. HLA-B27 has also been linked with inflammatory bowel disease and a range of other chronic conditions.
Ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis are both chronic, progressive conditions that occur more frequently in men than women. The first symptoms typically occur when a person is in their early 30's. Often, the initial symptoms of these autoimmune disorders are subtle and may take several years before characteristic degenerative changes to bones and joints are visible on X-rays.

Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by pain, inflammation, and a gradual stiffening of the spine, neck and chest.
Reactive arthritis is a group of symptoms that includes inflammation of the joints, urethra, and eyes as well as skin lesions.
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is a form of arthritis that occurs in children.
Anterior uveitis is associated with recurring inflammation of the structures of one or both eyes.

While HLA-B27 has not been established as a cause of any of these disorders, there is a higher prevalence of the antigen in those affected. For example, even though only 6% of the population has HLA-B27, 80-90% of people with ankylosing spondylitis are positive for HLA-B27.

When you have symptoms of arthritis-like chronic joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation in certain areas of your body, such as your lower back, hips, neck, and chest, or have painful inflammation of the eyes called uveitis, especially if you are male and the symptoms began in your early 30s


","



An HLA-B27 test may be ordered when a person has acute or chronic pain and inflammation in the spine, neck, chest, eyes, and/or joints, and the healthcare practitioner suspects the cause is an autoimmune disorder that is associated with the presence of HLA-B27. An HLA-B27 test may also be ordered when someone has recurrent uveitis.
Healthcare practitioners frequently use the HLA-B27 test result when they suspect ankylosing spondylitis but the disease is in an early stage and the vertebrae in the spine have not yet undergone the characteristic changes that would be seen on X-ray.



","



A positive HLA-B27 test means that the person tested is at increased risk of developing certain autoimmune diseases. If the person has symptoms such as chronic pain, inflammation, and/ or degenerative changes to bones (as seen on X-ray), then it supports a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, or another autoimmune disorder that is associated with the presence of HLA-B27. This is especially true if the person is young, male, and if he experienced his first symptoms before the age of 40.
If an HLA-B27 test is negative, then the marker was not detected. This does not mean, however, that the person tested does not have the suspected condition since people who do not have the HLA-B27 antigen can also develop these autoimmune diseases. Likewise, someone who has the HLA-B27 antigen will not necessarily develop one of these conditions. Researchers are trying to determine what factors contribute to the higher likelihood of people with HLA-B27 developing these particular diseases and what actually triggers them.
Whether or not certain HLA antigens will be present is genetically determined. Genes that are passed from parents to their children control the production of those antigens. If two members of the same family are HLA-B27 positive and one of them develops a disease associated with HLA-B27, then the other person is at an increased risk of developing a similar disease.



","



Though the diseases associated with HLA-B27 occur more frequently in men, women can also be affected. However, the signs and symptoms related to the diseases can often be milder in women.
With new genetic testing methods, it is now possible to separate HLA-B27 into subtypes. So far, at least 105 different subtypes have been identified, such as HLA B27*05 and HLA B27*02. How the presence of these specific subtypes affects the likelihood of developing an autoimmune disease is not yet known.



",,"



The HLA-B27 test is primarily ordered to help strengthen or confirm a suspected diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis (AS), reactive arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), or sometimes anterior uveitis. The HLA-B27 test is not diagnostic; that is, it is not a definitive test that can be used to diagnose or rule out a disorder. The result adds information and is one piece of evidence used along with the evaluation of signs, symptoms, and other laboratory tests to support or rule out the diagnosis of certain autoimmune disorders, such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis.
The HLA-B27 test may be ordered as part of a group of tests used to help diagnose and evaluate conditions causing arthritis-like chronic joint pain, stiffness, and inflammation. This group of tests may include a rheumatoid factor (RF) with either an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or a C-reactive protein (CRP). HLA-B27 is sometimes ordered to help evaluate someone with recurrent uveitis that is not caused by a recognizable disease process.

Testing is usually performed only in the setting of a planned transplantation where you are either the intended transplant recipient or a possible donor. Testing identifies which human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and antigens you have inherited and detects antibodies to HLA antigens that would cause transplants to be unsuccessful; testing may also be done to identify HLA antigen types in platelet blood donors that match transfusion recipients.

Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are specialized proteins present on the surface of all cells in the body except red blood cells. The HLA genes that individuals inherit are responsible for the HLA antigens present on their cells. HLA testing identifies the major HLA antigens that are present on the surface of an individual's cells and the antibodies to HLA antigens as well as the genes that are responsible for HLA antigens, primarily to match transplant donors and recipients.
In humans, the HLA genes are located in region of chromosome 6 called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC plays an essential role in the management of the immune system. It helps the body's immune system distinguish which cells are ""self"" and which are ""foreign"" or ""non-self."" Any cells that are recognized as ""non-self"" can trigger an immune response, including the production of antibodies. HLA antibody testing is performed on transplant recipients to determine if they have antibodies that would target the HLA antigens on the donated organ or tissue. HLA antibody testing is also performed on platelet transfusion recipients to determine if they have any antibodies that would target the donor's platelets and prevent a good response to the transfusion.
For hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant, the HLA genes of the donor and recipient must be the same or match as closely as possible for transplantation to be successful and to lessen the chance of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (See Common Questions below).
In solid organ transplants, such as kidney, heart, or lung transplants, ABO blood group compatibility is critical. After matching ABO types, it is also beneficial to match the HLA antigens between the donor and recipient. Unlike ABO matching, HLA typing mismatches are less critical as long as the recipient has not developed HLA antibodies directed against donor's antigens. Various drugs may be administered to help suppress the recipient's immune system in order to minimize organ rejection.
Finding a donor who is compatible with an intended recipient may sometimes be difficult. Part of the reason is because each HLA gene can have numerous possible forms or variations (alleles). This characteristic is referred to as polymorphic. In addition, there are more than 200 genes that make up the large HLA gene family located on chromosome 6. Considering the many different possible combinations and numerous types of HLA alleles, it can be a challenge to find a suitable donor, especially if the recipient has pre-formed HLA antibodies.
Nevertheless, HLA genes are located close together and inherited together as groups known as haplotypes; thus, a child inherits one haplotype from each parent. Because of this, there is a greater chance that family members will have the same group of HLA alleles compared to non-related potential donors. Often, a recipient's parents, children, or siblings may serve as the best transplant matches.
Read the article on The Universe of Genetic Testing for more on inheritance and the HLA system.

Most often, transplant recipients are tested when it is determined that they need a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplant. Prior to transplant, potential donors are tested when they are being evaluated for compatibility with a specific recipient or are signing up with a national donor registry.
Some recipients requiring platelet transfusions do not display a rise in their platelet count because of the presence of HLA antibodies. To improve the platelet response, blood donors of platelets are HLA-antigen-matched to the recipient.


","



Transplant recipients: HLA gene or antigen and antibody testing is typically performed when it is first determined that a person needs to have a transplant. HLA gene and antigen results do not change unless a person has received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant. However, HLA antibody testing and identification may be done periodically and after events, such as a pregnancy, to see if the potential recipient has developed additional HLA antibodies. HLA antibodies may also be produced in response to a recent blood or platelet transfusion.
Post-transplant, the presence of antibodies to donor antigens, along with other assessments such as a tissue biopsy sample of the transplanted organ, may indicate the recipient is experiencing rejection of the transplanted organ. This information is important for the healthcare practitioner to assess and treat promptly.
Transplant donors: HLA gene or antigen typing is performed for family members when they have volunteered to see if they are a match for a relative who needs a kidney, liver, hematopoietic stem cell, or other type of transplant. Living unrelated persons may also be tested as potential donors, and this is frequently the case for kidney transplants. HLA antigen typing is also performed on unrelated individuals who wish to become a bone marrow donor through the donation registry.
When an organ is from a deceased donor, ABO and HLA antigen testing is performed as quickly as possible to match it to a potential recipient. The amount of time available to ensure the greatest viability of the organ ranges from a few hours (e.g., for heart and lungs, 4 to 6 hours) to no more than 1 to 3 days (e.g., for a kidney, 48 to 72 hours; for a liver, 12 to 24 hours).
Crossmatch testing with the potential donor is performed just prior to an organ transplant to ensure compatibility. In the case of living donor transplantation, the crossmatch compatibility testing is usually performed more than once, when the donor is initially identified and again just before the actual transplant procedure.



","



Specific HLA genes or antigens are identified during HLA testing to ensure solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant compatibility. The typing result of the recipient is compared to those of the potential donor. Results indicate how many antigens match and how many antigen mismatches are present. ""0 mismatches"" indicates a high probability that the organ or tissue will not be rejected by the recipient.
The absence of recipient HLA antibodies to the donor HLA antigens is very important. Matching a donor with a recipient who has developed antibodies must be carefully considered because the more HLA antibodies a person has developed, the higher risk for rejection.
An incompatible crossmatch result due to donor specific antibodies is usually interpreted as a high-risk transplant, meaning the recipient is at risk for rejection of the transplant. Graft rejection may or may not be treatable with various immunosuppressant drugs.



","



HLA testing is performed in laboratories that specialize in histocompatibility and immunogenetics. Many are accredited by the American Society of Histocompatibility & Immunogenetics (ASHI) or the College of American Pathology (CAP). Histocompatibility literally means tissue compatibility and involves testing donors and recipients to see if they are HLA matches. Immunogenetics is the study of the relationships between the immune system, genetics, and disease development.



","



The primary use for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is to match organ and tissue transplant recipients with compatible donors.
HLA testing also includes screening transplant recipients for the presence of antibodies that might target the donated tissue or organ as part of an immune response.
Different kinds of transplants necessitate different levels of matching between donor and intended recipient. This may determine which HLA tests are performed and which HLA genes are tested for.
There are typically three components of testing used to determine HLA compatibility:

HLA antigen typing of donors and recipients – this step involves identifying HLA alleles. Family members who volunteer to donate hematopoietic stem cells, or an organ are HLA-antigen tested to see if they are a match for the relative who needs a transplant.

	If people want to make themselves available to donate hematopoietic stem cells to anyone who needs it, they can sign up with a national registry such as the United States National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). HLA testing is performed and test results are kept on file to compare with results from those people who need a donor match.

HLA antibody screening of recipients – HLA antibody testing is performed on the recipient to determine if there are any antibodies present that would target the donated organ or tissue. Some people have HLA-specific antibodies that developed following an exposure to non-self antigens. There are essentially three reasons for exposure to non-self HLA antigens: pregnancy, particularly multiple pregnancies (from exposure to the father's HLA antigens that have been passed on to the fetus), blood or platelet transfusions, or previous transplant(s). Once formed, HLA antibodies must be considered during matching because they can potentially attack donor tissues that have the corresponding HLA antigen.
	While the person waiting is for a matching donor to become available, HLA antibody testing may be periodically performed and updated to determine if the person has developed additional HLA antibodies. HLA antibody assessment may also be used post-transplant to determine if the recipient has developed antibodies to the transplanted donor HLA antigens. Antibodies formed post-transplant may increase the risk of graft failure.

Lymphocyte crossmatching (Donor-specific) – This step may be done in some cases after a potential donor has been identified. It helps determine if the intended recipient has antibodies directed against antigens present on the donor's lymphocytes. Serum from the intended recipient is mixed with white blood cells (T and B lymphocytes) from the donor. Any reaction detected (a positive result) would indicate likely incompatibility between the two. The crossmatch result should always be interpreted along with known information regarding the recipient's HLA antibodies and the donor's HLA typing.

Since the MHC system is involved in recognizing ""self"" and ""non-self"" antigens, HLA gene testing may be used to aid in the diagnosis certain diseases, such as autoimmune disease. The body can inappropriately mount an immune response against its own self-cells, producing antibodies (autoantibodies). More than 100 diseases have been associated with particular HLA genes, such as ankylosing spondylitis, which is associated with the HLA-B27 allele. HLA typing may also be important in preventing reactions to certain medications as side effects have been noted with certain drugs and specific HLA genotypes.

You may be instructed to fast for 10 to 12 hours prior to this test; only water is permitted.

To help determine if you are deficient in vitamins B6, B9 (folate) or B12; to determine if you are at increased risk of heart attack or stroke; to monitor those who have heart disease; sometimes to help diagnose a rare inherited disorder called homocystinuria in newborns


","

A blood sample taken by needle from a vein


","



Homocysteine is an amino acid that is typically present in very small amounts in all cells of the body. That is because the body normally converts homocysteine into other products quickly. Since vitamins B6, B12, and folate are necessary to metabolize homocysteine, increased levels of the amino acid may be a sign of deficiency in those vitamins. This test determines the level of homocysteine in the blood and/or urine.
Elevated homocysteine may also be related to a higher risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease (fatty deposits in peripheral arteries), and hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis). High levels of homocysteine increase the risk of blood clot formation in vessels and may lead to heart attack and stroke. Several mechanisms have been proposed for how homocysteine leads to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, but direct links haven not been confirmed. There are also several studies that indicate no benefit or lowering of CVD risk with folic acid and B vitamin supplements. So far, the American Heart Association does not consider it a major risk factor for heart disease.
A rare inherited condition called homocystinuria can also greatly increase homocysteine in the blood and urine. In the U.S., all babies are routinely tested for excess methionine, a sign of homocystinuria, as part of their newborn screening. If a baby's screening test is positive, then urine and blood homocysteine tests are often performed. For more information, see Common Questions below.

When your healthcare provider suspects that you have a vitamin B6, B12 or folate deficiency; when you have had a heart attack or stroke and do not have traditional risk factors, such as unhealthy lipid levels


","



This test may be ordered when a health practitioner suspects that a person may have a vitamin B12 and/or folate deficiency. Signs and symptoms are initially subtle and nonspecific. People with an early deficiency may be diagnosed before they experience any overt symptoms. Other affected people may experience a variety of mild to severe symptoms that can include:

Diarrhea
Dizziness
Fatigue, weakness
Loss of appetite
Paleness
Rapid heart rate
Shortness of breath
Sore tongue and mouth
Tingling, numbness, and/or burning in the feet, hands, arms, and legs (with B12 deficiency)

Homocysteine testing may be ordered as part of assessing a person's risk of cardiovascular disease, depending on the individual's age and other risk factors. It may also be ordered following a heart attack or stroke to help guide treatment.



","



In cases of suspected malnutrition or vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, homocysteine levels may be elevated. If an individual does not get enough B vitamins and/or folate through diet or supplements, then the body may not be able to convert homocysteine to forms that can be used by the body. In this case, the level of homocysteine in the blood can increase.
Studies from the mid- to late-1990s suggested that people who have elevated homocysteine levels have a much greater risk of heart attack or stroke than those with average levels. Investigating the link between high homocysteine levels and heart disease remains an active area of research. At present, however, the use of homocysteine levels for risk assessment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), peripheral vascular disease, and stroke is uncertain given that several trials investigating folic acid and B vitamin supplementation indicate no benefit or lowering of CVD risk.
Additionally, a 2012 study of multiple datasets, including 50,000 people with coronary heart disease, called the potential for a cause-and-effect relationship between homocysteine levels and heart disease into question. A 2015 review of studies concluded that although there is a relationship between the homocysteine and CVD, there is other evidence that precludes homocysteine in being considered a biomarker for the disease. The American Heart Association (AHA) does acknowledge the relationship between homocysteine levels and heart attack/stroke survival rates but doesn't consider elevated homocysteine a major risk factor for CVD.
While the AHA does not recommend widespread use of folic acid and B vitamins to reduce risk of heart attack and stroke, it does promote a balanced, healthy diet and advises healthcare practitioners to consider overall risk factors and diet in managing cardiovascular disease.



","



When test results suggest homocystinuria, liver or skin biopsy samples are sometimes tested to determine whether the enzyme cystathionine beta synthase (CBS) is present. The absence of this enzyme is the most common cause of homocystinuria. Genetic tests may be ordered to test for one or more of the most common gene mutations. If someone has a strong family history of early atherosclerosis or a family member has been diagnosed with homocystinuria, then that person should be tested for the gene mutation that was found in the family member.
Homocysteine levels can increase with age, when a person smokes, and with the use of drugs such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin. Homocysteine levels are lower in women than in men. Women's concentrations increase after menopause, possibly due to decreased estrogen production.



",,"



The homocysteine test may be used the following ways:

A healthcare practitioner may order a homocysteine test to determine if a person has a vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. The homocysteine concentration may be elevated before B12 and folate tests are abnormal. Some healthcare practitioners may recommend homocysteine testing in malnourished individuals, the elderly, who often absorb less vitamin B12 from their diet, and individuals with poor nutrition, such as drug or alcohol addicts.
Homocysteine may be ordered as part of a screen for people at high risk for heart attack or stroke. It may be useful in someone who has a family history of coronary artery disease but no other known risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, or obesity. However, the exact role that homocysteine plays in the progression of cardiovascular disease has not been established, so the utility of the screening test continues to be questioned. Routine screening, such as that done for total cholesterol, has not been recommended.

None


","

To help monitor epithelial ovarian cancer after treatment; to detect recurrence or disease progression; not recommended for screening asymptomatic women for ovarian cancer


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is a protein that is produced by most, but not all, epithelial ovarian cancer cells. This makes the test useful as a tumor marker in specific circumstances. The HE4 test measures the amount of human epididymis protein 4 in the blood.
Significantly elevated concentrations of HE4 are frequently present in the blood of a woman who has epithelial ovarian cancer. When HE4 is increased, the HE4 test may be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and/or for recurrence or progression of the cancer.
Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women. According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), the lifetime risk of a woman developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 75 and the lifetime risk of death is 1 in 100. ACS estimates that about 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year in the U.S. and about 14,000 women die of it.
Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer. It originates in cells that cover the outside of the ovaries and accounts for 85% to 90% of ovarian cancers.
There are several different subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer, including: serous, endometrioid, mucinous, and clear cell, with serous being the most common. Some studies have shown that HE4 is elevated in more than 90% of serous and endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancers and about 50% of clear cell tumors, but it is not usually elevated in mucinous cancers. Therefore, HE4 is not used for monitoring of patients with other types of ovarian cancer, such as mucinous or germ cell tumors.
Currently, there is no reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women. Less than 20% of ovarian cancers are found in the early stages before they have spread outside the ovary. One reason they go undetected is that the symptoms of ovarian cancer are fairly non-specific. The need for a reliable method for early detection of ovarian cancer among asymptomatic women continues to drive ongoing research. In the meantime, regular physicals, pelvic exams, and an awareness of family history and symptoms are important. (For more information, see the article on Ovarian Cancer.)

Before starting therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer and at intervals after treatment


","



The HE4 test may be ordered along with a CA-125 and other clinical evaluations when a woman is diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer to see if these proteins are being produced by the cancer and to establish a baseline to compare against future measurements. If the concentrations are elevated prior to treatment, then HE4 and CA-125 may be ordered periodically after treatment to determine the change of the test results and monitor for cancer recurrence or disease progression.
Occasionally, a healthcare practitioner may order HE4 and CA-125 as part of a ROMA calculation when a woman has a pelvic mass to help determine whether the mass is likely to be malignant.



","



If a woman who has been diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer has a baseline HE4 that is normal, then the test is not useful to monitor her ovarian cancer.
If HE4 and CA-125 levels are initially elevated and then decline after treatment, it generally means that the epithelial ovarian cancer has responded to treatment.
If levels rise or stay the same, then the cancer has likely not responded. Increased and increasing HE4 and CA-125 levels found during periodic monitoring after cancer treatment or surgery may indicate that the cancer has come back.
In a woman with a lump in her pelvis who will be undergoing surgery, an increased ROMA score can predict that the pelvic mass is more likely to be malignant.



","



Different laboratories may use different types of tests to measure HE4, thus results from different labs may not be comparable. When undergoing a series of HE4 tests, it is preferable that all of the tests be performed using the same type of test, usually by the same laboratory. This ensures that results from the series of tests can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to talk to your healthcare provider about where your tests are done.



","



Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is used along with CA-125 to monitor women who have been treated for epithelial ovarian cancer. In order for HE4 to be useful as a tumor marker, it must be elevated prior to treatment. CA-125 has been the primary tool used to monitor ovarian cancers, but it is not elevated in all cancers, may not be significantly increased with early cancer, and can be elevated in non-cancerous conditions. For these reasons, the medical community continues to search for tumor markers that are more sensitive and specific.
Ordering HE4 and CA-125 together provides complementary information and creates a better monitoring system to detect whether treatment has been effective and whether epithelial ovarian cancer has come back. These tests are ordered prior to treatment to establish a baseline and then periodically after treatment. A series of HE4 and CA-125 tests that show rising or falling concentrations is often more useful than a single sample set. Serial testing for HE4 should be used in conjunction with other clinical findings for monitoring ovarian cancer. HE4 test results by different instruments/methods cannot be compared with one another.
HE4 is not recommended as a screening test for asymptomatic women because it is non-specific. Small amounts of HE4 can be produced by normal tissues throughout the body and mild elevations may be seen in individuals with a variety of non-cancerous conditions.
The HE4 test is not intended to be used to monitor mucinous epithelial ovarian cancers or germ cell tumors because it is rarely elevated in these cancers.
An additional use of HE4 is as part of a Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA). This calculation combines the results of HE4, CA-125, and a woman's menopausal status into a numerical score. The ROMA score can be used by a healthcare practitioner prior to surgery to help determine whether a lump in the pelvis (pelvic mass) is likely to be malignant or not.

It is typically recommended that you refrain from having sex, douching, or using vaginal products such as creams, deodorants, or medications for 24 hours before the test. Follow any instructions you are given. Reschedule the test if you are having your period (menstruating). You may be asked to empty your bladder before the examination. The American Cancer Society has details about how to prepare for the test when it is done at the same time as a Pap smear.

To screen for infections with the high-risk types of HPV (hrHPV) that can cause cervical cancer or to follow up on an abnormal Pap smear (Pap test)


","

A sample of cells is taken from the cervical area during a pelvic exam using a swab or small brush. The sample is then placed into a bottle containing a special liquid preservative. The same sample of cells can be used for both the Pap smear and the HPV test.


","



Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 150 related viruses. Some types of HPV are considered high risk because they can cause cancer. HPV testing detects the genetic material (DNA or messenger RNA) of high-risk HPV (hrHPV), primarily to screen for cervical cancer or to determine whether you may be at risk of cervical cancer.
Some types of HPV can cause skin warts, while other types can cause genital warts (also called condylomata). Genital HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (i.e., spread through oral, anal, or genital sex). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 79 million Americans are infected with HPV and over 14 million become newly infected each year.

Low-risk HPV—some HPV strains cause genital warts but rarely cause cancer. HPV 6 and HPV 11 cause 90% of all genital warts but are considered ""low risk"" because they rarely lead to cancer. These low-risk types can be diagnosed through visual inspection and, therefore, do not require testing.
High-risk HPV—there are 14 high-risk types of HPV that can lead to cancer (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68). Two HPV types,16 and 18, cause 80% of all cervical cancers. These high-risk types can be detected with an HPV test.


Many HPV infections resolve without treatment—the body is able to clear the infection. However, infections with high-risk HPV types that do not go away can lead to cervical cancer. Almost all cervical cancers are caused by persistent infections with high-risk HPV. Each year, nearly 12,000 women in the U.S. develop cervical cancer and about 4,000 are expected to die from it.
In addition, some studies have also shown that persistent oral infections with high-risk types of HPV are strongly associated with oral cancers, including cancer of the mouth and throat (oropharyngeal cancer). Anal cancer has also been linked to HPV types 16 and 18. These types are also linked to other cancers, such as those of the vagina and penis.

If you are a woman aged 21 to 29 and have an abnormal Pap smear result



","



Several health organizations have recommendations on when to get screened for cervical cancer. HPV testing may be ordered as part of screening when you are at average risk of cervical cancer and between the ages of 30 and 65. The following is a summary of screening recommendations for average risk women:



Screening Strategy
Timing
Pros
Cons


Co-testing with a Pap smear (Pap test) and HPV test (preferred)
Every 5 years
Will likely detect more precancers and cancers; done less frequently than Pap smears alone
More false positives than Pap smear alone, leading to unnecessary anxiety and follow up


Pap smears alone (acceptable)
Every 3 years
Fewer false positives
Not as sensitive as co-testing (may miss some precancers and cancers); Done more often


HPV tests alone (alternative)
Every 5 years
Done less frequently than Pap smears alone
Finds HPV infections that may not cause problems; misses uncommon cancers that are not caused by HPV



You should have a discussion with your healthcare provider about the pros and cons of all three screening strategies so you can decide which approach is best for you.
Screening at a younger age and more frequent screening is advised if you have risk factors such as:

A previous diagnosis of a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion or cervical cancer
HIV infection
A weakened immune system
Exposure to DES (diethylstilbestrol) before birth


HPV testing also may be performed when you are between 21 and 29 years of age and you have abnormal results on a Pap smear.

HPV test and Pap smear results go hand-in-hand when determining a woman's risk for cervical cancer. Results from an HPV test and Pap smear can help determine whether cervical cells are infected with a high-risk type of HPV and identify abnormal changes in cervical cells.
HPV results are typically reported as negative or positive. Pap smear results are typically provided in a detailed report with an interpretation of results. (See the Pap Smear article for details.)
The following chart summarizes the meaning of some common co-testing results and includes the American Cancer Society (ACS), American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), and American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP) recommendations for follow up. Remember, co-testing is currently recommended for women aged 30 to 65 years.



Co-testing Results
What Results Might Mean
Recommended Follow Up


HPV test negative, Pap smear normal
Cervical cancer risk is low at the present time.
Repeat co-testing in 5 years (or Pap test alone in 3 years)


HPV test positive, Pap smear normal
Cervical cells are infected with a high-risk type of HPV, but no abnormalities found in cervical cells.
Option 1: Repeat co-testing in 12 months
			Option 2: Test for HPV-16 and HPV-18
			- Positive: colposcopy recommended to examine the cervix for abnormal areas, to take samples for biopsy, and/or treat as indicated
			- Negative: repeat co-testing in 12 months


HPV test negative, Pap smear result unclear (ASCUS)
No HPV infection; changes in cervical cells may be the result of infection, inflammation, or hormonal changes and are likely to clear up without treatment.
Repeat co-testing in 3 years


HPV test positive, Pap smear result unclear (ASCUS)
Cervical cells are infected with a high-risk type of HPV. The infection is the likely cause of abnormalities in your cervical cells.
Colposcopy recommended


HPV test negative, Pap smear abnormal [low- or high-grade lesion (LSIL, HSIL)]
No HPV infection; cause of abnormal cervical cells unknown
Option 1: Repeat co-testing in 12 months
			Option 2: Colposcopy recommended


HPV test positive, Pap smear abnormal [low- or high-grade lesion (LSIL, HSIL)]
Cervical cells are infected with a high-risk type of HPV, which is the likely cause of abnormal cell growth.
Colposcopy recommended



If a Pap smear is performed without an HPV test, the presence of abnormal cervical cells indicates the need to perform an HPV test to determine whether HPV infection is the cause of the cellular changes.



","



Most people who become infected with high-risk types of HPV never develop precancerous changes or cancer.
Being infected with HPV does not necessarily mean that your partner is having sex outside your relationship. The HPV virus can hide in cervical cells for many years; so if either of you has ever had sex with another partner, you can pass the infection to your current partner.
Although very rare, a pregnant woman may pass HPV to her baby during vaginal delivery, resulting in warts in the throat or voice box (laryngeal papillomatosis or recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, RRP).
Being infected with HPV will not make it difficult for you to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term. However, some methods of treating precancerous growths resulting from HPV infection can make it more difficult to get pregnant or have an uncomplicated delivery.



",,"



The HPV test is primarily used to screen for cervical cancer and/or determine whether you may be at increased risk of cervical cancer if you are a woman between the ages of 30 and 65. The test determines whether your cervical cells are infected with a high-risk type of human papillomavirus (hrHPV). Such an infection, if long-lasting, can cause changes in cervical cells that could lead to cervical cancer.
Because HPV infections are relatively common in women younger than 25 and often go away without treatment or complications, HPV screening is not recommended in this age group. However, HPV testing may be used as a follow-up test in women between the ages of 21 and 29 years who have abnormal results on a Pap smear known as ""atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance"" (AS-CUS). Results may be used to determine the need for colposcopy, a procedure that allows a healthcare practitioner to visually inspect the vagina and cervix under magnification for any abnormal areas and to collect samples for a biopsy and/or treat as necessary.

","



Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection is associated with certain rare diseases of T lymphocytes (T-cells), a type of white blood cell that is an important part of the body's immune system. This test detects an HTLV infection in order to help identify the virus as the underlying cause of an individual's leukemia, lymphoma, rare nervous system disorder, chronic pulmonary infection, uveitis, infectious dermatitis, or other inflammatory disorder.
Two types of HTLV are most commonly identified through testing: HTLV-I and HTLV-II. It is estimated that 15-20 million people worldwide are infected with HTLV. The prevalence of HTLV-1 infection is greatest in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean islands, and Central and South America. HTLV-II appears to be endemic among Native American populations and is prevalent among intravenous (IV) drug users in North America and Europe.
In the United States, about 22 out of every 100,000 people are infected with HTLV, with HTLV-II infection being more common than HTLV-I infection. HTLV-II infection is associated with female sex, older age, non-white race/ethnicity, lower educational level, and residence in the Western and Southwestern U.S. Some Native American Indian populations have infection rates as high as 13%. Those most likely to be infected with HTLV-I have immigrated to the U.S. from a country where HTLV-1 infection is prevalent, are children of such immigrants, are IV drug users, or are sex workers.
An HTLV-I infection can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Both HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections can be sexually transmitted or spread through exposure to contaminated blood as occurs with sharing of needles during IV drug use, although the majority of drug use-related infections are linked to HTLV-II. Both types may be passed through a blood transfusion or an organ transplant, but infection due to these procedures is now rare in the United States because all donors are tested for HTLV-I/II.
Other risk factors for HTLV infection include: living in parts of the world where HTLV is more common (such as those listed above); having a sexual partner who came from one of these areas; having multiple sex partners; being an IV drug user; being Native American Indian; or having a history of blood transfusions.
Both HTLV-I and HTLV-II preferentially infect T-lymphocytes. Most people infected with HTLV-I or HTLV–II will have few to no symptoms but can pass the infection on to others. After the initial infection, the virus never completely goes away but remains in the body in an inactive (latent) form. A small percentage of those infected go on to develop one of several associated diseases, typically months to many years or even decades after their initial exposure, and may then become acutely or chronically ill.
HTLV-I is associated with:

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), a type of white blood cell cancer that may progress rapidly or slowly and cause symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and enlarged lymph nodes
HTLV-I–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a rare condition that can cause weakness in the lower limbs, muscle spasms, nerve pain, and urinary incontinence
In some cases, other conditions such as uveitis, HTLV-I–associated infective dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjögren syndrome

HTLV-II is less clearly linked with specific diseases but may be associated with certain lung conditions, neurological disorders, arthritis, asthma, and dermatitis.
The body responds to an HTLV-I or HTLV-II infection by producing antibodies. These antibodies can be detected in the blood during testing. The viruses may also be directly tested using molecular tests (polymerase chain reaction, PCR) that detect the genetic material of the viruses.

A person when he or she has risk factors and symptoms that the healthcare practitioner suspects may be linked to an HTLV infection, such as uveitis, dermatitis, or arthritis




","



HTLV testing is usually done in a stepwise fashion and usually includes an initial test followed by confirmatory testing, depending on the results.
If initial HTLV testing is negative, then it is unlikely that the individual has an HTLV infection and the person's symptoms are likely due to another cause. Typically, no further testing is necessary.
If someone has HTLV-I or HTLV-II antibodies on both initial and confirmatory testing, then it is likely that the person has an HTLV infection. If the person also have symptoms linked to an HTLV-associated condition, then it is likely that this infection is the underlying cause.
A person with positive initial and confirmatory results but no symptoms, such as someone who has been tested because she is the mother of an affected child or the sexual partner of an affected person, or someone whose donated blood was positive and confirmatory testing is also positive, is likely to have the infection. However, in the vast majority of cases, the person will never develop an illness. These people can, however, pass the infection on to other people and should take necessary precautions (see Common Questions #3).
Those who have a positive initial HTLV-I/II test and a negative confirmatory test likely have a false positive and not an HTLV infection. Those with an indeterminate confirmatory test result should be retested in several weeks to determine if they have developed antibodies. If the confirmatory testing is negative or still indeterminate, then it is unlikely that the person has an HTLV infection.
A positive HTLV-I/II molecular test indicates that the person tested has an HTLV-I or HTLV-II infection. If the molecular result is negative, then the person is less likely to be infected, but it cannot be ruled out as the amount of virus in the blood may have been too low to detect at the time of the test.
The following table summarizes some typical results that may be seen with HTLV testing:



Initial Antibody Testing (HTLV I/II)

","



The HTLV-I/II viruses become inactive (latent) in the body after an infection, but they are never totally eradicated. For this reason, a person who has tested positive will not be able to donate blood.
HTLV-II antibodies may show a positive result on a test for HTLV-I antibodies (cross-reaction). This means that even though a person has really had an HTLV-II infection, initial testing may show an HTLV-I positive test result.



",,"



Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) testing is used to detect an infection by HTLV-I or HTLV-II. When the virus enters the body, it preferentially infects T-cell lymphocytes. The body's immune system responds by producing antibodies that target the virus. Most individuals who are infected do not develop an active illness, but a rare few will develop a condition related to a disorder of the T-cells.
HTLV testing may be used in a few different ways:

In people with risk factors for HTLV (such as living in parts of the world where HTLV infection is more common, having a sexual partner who came from one of these areas, having multiple sex partners, being an IV drug user, being a Native American Indian, or having a history of blood transfusions), testing may be used to follow-up abnormal findings from a complete blood count (CBC) and WBC differential, such as an increased number of immature and/or abnormal lymphocytes.
To diagnose the cause of a T-cell-related disorder if a person has symptoms consistent with HTLV-I–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), especially if the person has risk factors associated with this condition; in some cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may be tested for HTLV.
To determine the source of an affected individual's infection; since HTLV can be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy, the mother of an affected child may be tested for HTLV-I or HTLV-II to determine if she is the likely source of the child's infection. Likewise, the sexual partner of an affected person may be tested.

Two types of HTLV testing are available, antibody and molecular testing:

Typically, an EIA (enzyme immunoassay) test method is used initially to detect HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies in the blood. If the initial test is positive, a second method, such as Western blot, is ordered to confirm the finding and to help distinguish between HTLV-I and HTLV-II.
In cases where HTLV-I and HTLV-II cannot be distinguished, molecular testing (polymerase chain reaction method, PCR) that detects the genetic material of the virus may be performed.

In the U.S., all donated blood is screened for HTLV. If a person who has donated blood tests positive for HTLV-I/II, then confirmatory testing may be performed to determine if the initial screening result is a false positive or if the person who donated the blood has an HTLV-I/II infection.

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily targets the lungs but may affect any area of the body such as the urinary tract, central nervous system, bones, joints, and/or other organs. An interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test screens for exposure to TB by indirectly measuring the body's immune response to antigens derived from these bacteria.
TB may cause an inactive (latent) infection or an active, progressive disease. The immune system of about 90% of people who become infected with TB manages to control its growth and confine the TB infection to a few cells in the body. The bacteria in these cells are inactive but still alive. The person does not have any symptoms and is not infectious but does have a ""latent TB infection.""
If, after some time, the immune system of an individual with an inactive infection becomes weakened (compromised), the mycobacteria may begin to grow again, leading to an active case of tuberculosis disease. Active TB does cause illness and can be passed to others through respiratory secretions such as sputum or aerosols released by coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking, singing, or breathing.
The IGRA blood test can detect M. tuberculosis infections, but cannot distinguish between latent and active infections. Additional tests, such as AFB testing, are required to help establish a diagnosis of an active TB infection.

If you have been exposed to a person with TB; if you have a clinical condition or risk factor that makes progression to active TB more likely


","



IGRA testing may be ordered:

On a yearly basis for those who are part of a high-risk group, either because they have a disease that weakens their immune system or because they work or live around others in high-risk groups
Prior to a person joining an at-risk population, such as healthcare workers
When someone has been in close contact with someone who has an active case of TB; this would be done a few weeks after a suspected exposure as it usually takes about 6 weeks after contact and initial infection before a positive result would be detected.
When an individual has lived for an extended time in a country where TB is common
When a person has signs and symptoms of TB, such as a chronic cough that produces phlegm or sputum, sometimes with bloody streaks, fever, chills, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss




","



A positive IGRA test result means that the person is likely to have been exposed to TB and the person may have a latent or active TB infection. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has active tuberculosis, a history and physical examination and other tests, such as chest X-rays and AFB laboratory testing, are used to confirm the diagnosis.
A negative result means that it is likely that the person tested does not have a TB infection. However, it does not entirely rule out tuberculosis. It may mean that it is too early to detect exposure. It takes about 6 weeks after infection before a person demonstrates a positive reaction to an IGRA. If suspicion of TB remains high and a healthcare practitioner wants to confirm a negative or indeterminate result, the practitioner may repeat the IGRA or do a TST as an alternate follow-up test.
Occasionally, a person infected with or exposed to other Mycobacterium species, for example Mycobacterium kansasii, will give a false-positive IGRA result for TB. Positive results must be followed up by other tests such as chest X-rays to look for signs of active TB disease. If active TB disease is suspected, AFB testing including smears and cultures and sensitivity testing, may be used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the drug susceptibility for the M. tuberculosis infecting the person.



","



Positive TST results are commonly seen in those who have received a BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccination. IGRA results are not affected by BCG.



",,"



IGRAs are not used as general population screens but are used to screen people who are at high risk for tuberculosis (TB), such as:

People with diseases or conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or AIDS, which makes them more vulnerable to a TB infection
Those who are in confined living conditions such as homeless shelters, migrant farm camps, nursing homes, schools, and correctional facilities
Healthcare workers and others whose occupations bring them in close contact with those who may have active TB
Those who have been in close contact with someone who has an active case of TB
Those who come from or have lived for a period of time in a foreign country where TB may be more common
Those who inject illegal drugs

Either an IGRA or a tuberculin skin test (TST) may be performed to screen for TB, but in most cases the IGRA is now the preferred test.
The IGRA test measures the release of a substance called gamma interferon by white blood cells in a sample of blood when the cells are exposed to specific TB antigens. The IGRA test is not performed by all laboratories. The test requires viable white blood cells, so the IGRA blood sample must be received and tested by a laboratory within a designated window of time.
Recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Diseases Society, of America (IDSA), and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) list a preference for an IGRA test when:

Someone is unlikely to return to have their TST evaluated
The person is 5 years or older
Is likely to be infected with latent TB
Has a low to intermediate risk of progressing to active tuberculosis
A test for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is warranted
And/or if the person being tested has received the BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine that might interfere with the interpretation of a TST. BCG is not used as a vaccine in the United States, but it is often routinely administered in countries with a higher incidence of TB and it is used in the U.S. as a treatment for some cancers.

The TST test is considered an acceptable alternative to the IGRA if the IGRA is not available or is considered too costly or burdensome.
These same agencies do NOT recommend testing people who are not likely to be infected with TB, or those who are considered at a low risk for TB infection and disease progression.
However, when testing for latent TB infection is required, such as for employment or a legal requirement, they suggest:

An IGRA rather than a TST when someone is 5 years or older
A second test, either an IGRA or TST, when the initial test is positive and to only consider the person positive if both tests are positive
A TST rather than an IGRA when a person is less than 5 years old, healthy, and the TB screening is warranted

To help evaluate a person's immune system status; to detect and monitor an excess or deficiency in one or more of the immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgA, and IgM)


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. When required, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected by a healthcare practitioner from the lower back using a procedure called a lumbar puncture or spinal tap. Saliva or other fluids are collected in a container provided by the laboratory.


","



Immunoglobulins play a key role in the body's immune system. They are proteins produced by specific immune cells called plasma cells in response to bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms as well as exposures to other substances that are recognized by the body as ""non-self"" harmful antigens. This test measures the amount of immunoglobulins A, G, and M (IgA, IgG, IgM) in the blood and, in certain circumstances, in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or saliva.
The first time a person is infected or otherwise exposed to a foreign substance (antigen), their immune system recognizes the microorganism or substance as ""non-self"" and stimulates plasma cells to produce specific immunoglobulin(s), also called antibodies, that can bind to and neutralize the threat. With subsequent exposures, the immune system ""remembers"" the antigen that was encountered, which allows for the rapid production of more antibodies and, in the case of microorganisms, helps prevent re-infection.
There are five classes of immunoglobulins and several subclasses. Each class represents a group of antibodies and has a slightly different role. Classes of immunoglobulins include:

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) – IgM antibodies are produced as a body's first response to a new infection or to a new ""non-self"" antigen, providing short-term protection. They increase for several weeks and then decline as IgG production begins.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) – About 70-80% of the immunoglobulins in the blood are IgG. Specific IgG antibodies are produced during an initial infection or other antigen exposure, rising a few weeks after it begins, then decreasing and stabilizing. The body retains a catalog of IgG antibodies that can be rapidly reproduced whenever exposed to the same antigen. IgG antibodies form the basis of long-term protection against microorganisms. In those with a normal immune system, sufficient IgG is produced to prevent re-infection. Vaccinations use this process to prevent initial infections and add to the catalog of IgG antibodies, by exposing a person to a weakened, live microorganism or to an antigen that stimulates recognition of the microorganism. IgG is the only immunoglobulin that can pass through the placenta. The mother's IgG antibodies provide protection to the fetus during pregnancy and to the baby during its first few months of life. There are four subclasses of IgG: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4.
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) – IgA comprises about 15% of the total immunoglobulins in the blood but is also found in saliva, tears, respiratory and gastric secretions, and breast milk. IgA provides protection against infection in mucosal areas of the body such as the respiratory tract (sinus and lungs) and the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). When passed from mother to baby during breast-feeding, it helps protect the infant's gastrointestinal tract. Significant amounts of IgA are not produced by a baby until after 6 months of age so any IgA present in a baby's blood before then is from the mother's milk. There are two IgA subclasses: IgA1 and IgA2.
Immunoglobulin D (IgD) – the role of IgD is not completely understood and IgD is not routinely measured.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) – IgE is associated with allergies, allergic diseases, and with parasitic infections. It is almost always measured as part of an allergy testing blood panel but typically is not included as part of a quantitative immunoglobulins test.

Immunoglobulins testing measures the total amount of each primary immunoglobulin class, IgA, IgM, and IgG, without distinguishing between subclasses. Separate testing can be performed to measure immunoglobulin subclasses and/or to detect and measure specific antibodies.
A variety of conditions can cause an increase (hypergammaglobulinemia) or decrease (hypogammaglobulinemia) in the production of immunoglobulins. Some cause an excess or deficiency of all classes of immunoglobulins while others affect only one class. Some of the conditions are passed from one generation to the next (inherited) and others are acquired.

","



This test is ordered when a person has symptoms of an immunoglobulin deficiency such as recurrent infections, especially of the respiratory tract (sinus, lungs) or digestive system (stomach, intestines), and/or chronic diarrhea.
Immunoglobulins testing may also be ordered when a person has signs of chronic inflammation or chronic infection and when a healthcare practitioner suspects excess or abnormal immunoglobulin production. The test may be ordered periodically to monitor the course of a person's condition.
This test may also be performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whenever a healthcare practitioner suspects that a condition affecting the central nervous system may be associated with excess immunoglobulin production.



","



The results of the tests for IgG, IgA, and IgM levels are usually evaluated together. Abnormal test results typically indicate that there is something affecting the immune system and suggest the need for further testing. Immunoglobulins testing is not diagnostic but can be a strong indicator of a disease or condition. There are a number of conditions that are associated with increased and decreased immunoglobulins.
High levels
Increased polyclonal immunoglobulins may be seen with a variety of conditions.
Monoclonal immunoglobulins are seen in blood cell tumors that involve lymphocytes or plasma cells. In these disorders, there is typically a marked increase in one class of immunoglobulin and a decrease in the other two classes. Although affected people may have an increase in total immunoglobulins, they are actually immunocompromised because most of the immunoglobulins produced are abnormal and do not contribute to the immune response.
The following table lists some examples of conditions that may cause increased immunoglobulins:



Immunoglobulin Result
Associated Conditions


Polyclonal increase in any or all of the three classes (IgG, IgA and/or IgM)


Infections, acute and chronic
Autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma)
Cirrhosis
Chronic inflammation, inflammatory disorders
Hyperimmunization reactions
Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
In a newborn, infection during pregnancy (congenital—syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, CMV)




Monoclonal increase in one class with or without decrease in other two classes


Multiple myeloma
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance)
Lymphoma
Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (IgM)





Low levels
The most common causes of decreased immunoglobulins are acquired underlying (secondary) conditions that either affect the body's ability to produce immunoglobulins or that increase the loss of protein from the body. Deficiencies may also be due to drugs such as immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, phenytoin, and carbamazepine or due to toxins.
The table below lists some of the common causes of low levels:



Conditions/factors that affect immunoglobulin production


Drugs such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, immunosuppressant drugs
Complications from conditions such as kidney failure or diabetes
Transient delay in production in newborns, particularly premature infants (transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy)




Conditions that cause an abnormal loss of protein


Nephrotic syndrome—kidney disease in which protein is lost in the urine
Burns
Protein-losing enteropathy—any condition of the gastrointestinal tract that affects the digestion or absorption of protein





Inherited immune deficiencies are rare and are often referred to as primary immunodeficiencies. They may affect the production of all immunoglobulins, a single class, or one or more subclasses. Some of these disorders include agammaglobulinemia, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), x-linked agammaglobulinemia, ataxia telangiectasia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, hyper-IgM syndrome, and severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).
In CSF, immunoglobulins normally are present in very low concentrations. Increases may be seen, for example, with central nervous system infections (meningitis, encephalitis), inflammatory conditions, and multiple sclerosis.
Decreases in salivary IgA may be seen in those with recurrent respiratory infections.



","



People with conditions that cause decreased immunoglobulin levels often do not have a strong immune response to vaccinations; they may not produce a sufficient level of antibody to ensure protection and may not be able to receive live vaccines, such as those for polio or measles.
Many laboratory tests measure antibodies in the blood. Those with immunoglobulin deficiencies may have false-negative results on these types of tests. For example, one test for celiac disease detects the IgA class of anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG). If a person has a deficiency in IgA, then results of this test may be negative when the person, in fact, has celiac disease. If this is suspected to be the case, then a quantitative test for IgA may be performed.
If IgG or IgA concentrations are decreased, or a deficiency in one of their subclasses is suspected, then subclass testing may be performed to detect and further define the deficiency. Subclass deficiencies can be present even when an immunoglobulin class concentration, such as IgG, is normal.
Some people with IgA deficiencies may develop anti-IgA antibodies. When those with anti-IgA are given blood component transfusions that contain IgA (such as plasma or immunoglobulin treatments), they may experience a severe anaphylactic transfusion reaction.



",,"



A test for immunoglobulins (Igs) is used to detect an excess or deficiency in the three major classes of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM). It gives important information about the health of an individual's immune system and is used to help diagnose various conditions and diseases that affect the levels of one or more of these Ig classes.
In general, immunoglobulin disorders can be classified as:

Immunoglobulin excess
	
Polyclonal—an Ig excess in any or all immunoglobulin classes from many different immune (plasma) cells
Monoclonal—the excess immunoglobulins are from the clones of one plasma cell




Immunoglobulin deficiency
	
Secondary (acquired)—the most common Ig deficiencies are caused by an underlying condition or contributing factor
Primary (inherited)—these are rare disorders in which the body is not able to produce one or more classes of immunoglobulins



This test may be ordered along with others, such as a serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis, to help diagnose and monitor conditions associated with abnormal or excessive immunoglobulin production. When this is the case, a urine sample may be collected in addition to blood.
If an excessive amount of one of the immunoglobulin types is present, further testing by immunofixation can be done to determine if the immunoglobulin comes from clones of an abnormal plasma cell (monoclonal gammopathy). Monoclonal gammopathies are seen with multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells. Serum free light chain testing may also be performed.

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein. A bone marrow sample may be collected from the hip bone by a trained healthcare practitioner. (For more details, read the article on Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy.) Sometimes, a tissue sample, such as from a lymph node, is obtained using a biopsy or fine needle aspiration (FNA) procedure. Body fluid samples are obtained through collection of the fluid in a container or by inserting a needle into the body cavity and aspirating a portion of the fluid with a syringe.


","



Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry is a laboratory method that detects the presence or absence of white blood cell (WBC) markers called antigens. These antigens are protein structures found on or within WBCs. Specific groupings of these antigens are normally present on or within WBCs and are unique to specific cell types and stages of cell maturation. Additionally, specific patterns of antigens are present on abnormal cells seen in leukemias and lymphomas. Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may be useful in helping to diagnose, classify, treat and determine prognosis of these blood cell cancers.
Leukemias and lymphomas are caused by an abnormal white blood cell that begins to divide uncontrollably, making numerous copies of itself (clones). The abnormal cells grow, but they do not fight infections or perform other functions like normal WBCs. They do not die at a normal rate, so they accumulate in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, or other tissues. As the number of abnormal cells increases in the bone marrow, they may crowd out and inhibit the production of normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets, and eventually abnormal cells may also be released into the blood. As the number of abnormal cells increase in a lymph node, the size of the lymph node increases. Sometimes lymphomas also involve the blood and/or bone marrow.
If you have a leukemia or lymphoma, routine tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) and a WBC differential may show an increased number of white blood cells with a predominance of one type. These tests may suggest lymphoma or leukemia, but more information is generally needed to confirm a diagnosis and to identify a specific type of leukemia or lymphoma.
Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may be performed on blood, bone marrow, or other samples to provide this additional information. It can detect normal cells as well as abnormal cells whose pattern of markers are typically seen with specific types of leukemia and lymphoma. The results may also be used to predict how aggressive the cancer will be and/or whether it will respond to certain treatment. (For details on this laboratory method, read the article on Flow Cytometry.)
Most of the antigens that flow cytometry immunophenotyping detects are identified by a CD (clusters of differentiation or cluster designation) number (see the table in the ""What does the test result mean?"" section under Common Questions). CD numbers represent a naming convention that is based on international consensus. While hundreds of antigens have been identified and have a unique CD number, only a small number of these are routinely used.

Flow cytometry immunophenotyping may be ordered when you have an increased number of lymphocytes (or sometimes an increase in another type of white blood cell, WBC), anemia, a decreased platelet count, or immature WBCs that are not normally seen in the blood. These may be the first indication of a possible blood cell cancer.

A pathologist, often one specializing in the study of blood diseases and/or blood cell cancers (a hematopathologist), will consider the results from the complete blood count (CBC), differential, blood smear, bone marrow findings, and flow cytometry immunophenotyping as well as other tests in order to provide a diagnostic interpretation. A laboratory report will typically include specific results from the tests as well as an analysis of what those results mean.
The markers (antigens) that are present on the cells as detected by flow cytometry immunophenotyping will help characterize the cells present. A normal cell will display a pattern of antigens that correlates with the type and maturity of the cell. (Blood cells normally mature in the bone marrow and are released into circulation when they are mature or nearly mature.) The results from your immunophenotyping are compared to the pattern of antigens for “normal” cells as well as to patterns that are associated with abnormal cells (e.g., cells present with leukemias and lymphomas).
Your healthcare practitioner will consider the flow cytometry immunophenotyping results together with your clinical history, physical examination, signs and symptoms, as well as all laboratory tests to help make a diagnosis.
Each person's condition will be unique. You may have (or lack) certain antigens that are typically seen, yet you may still be diagnosed with a specific type of leukemia or lymphoma.
Here is one example:

The blood of an older child or adult normally contains some mature B cells, but circulating immature B cells are not normally present.
Both mature and immature B cells are normally positive for the CD19 marker.
Mature B cells are normally positive for CD20 but not CD34. CD20 is a marker of maturity and CD34 is a marker of immaturity. In fact, these two markers are not normally expressed together.
Now, if an adult has a small number of mature B cells but also has a large number of immature B cells which are positive for CD19 (remember, CD19 is a B-cell marker) and also positive for both CD34 and CD20 (which identifies those cells are both immature and abnormal), then the person has an immature B-cell leukemia known as B-lymphoblastic leukemia.
Interestingly, some of the other antigens present might suggest a specific genetic subtype of B-lymphoblastic leukemia, which also might have a certain prognosis.
More importantly, there are newer classes of treatment options like CAR-T therapy, bispecific T-cell engagers, and monoclonal antibodies that selectively target molecules like CD19 or CD20. These newer treatments may have reduced side effects compared to conventional chemotherapy (newer targeted therapies are usually added to traditional chemotherapy).

Abnormal immunophenotype profiles are usually present in:

Acute myeloid leukemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
B-cell and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas
Multiple myeloma

","



Trypsinogen is an inactive precursor produced by the pancreas that is converted to the enzyme trypsin. This test measures the amount of trypsinogen in the blood.
Normally, trypsinogen is produced in the pancreas and transported to the small intestine. In the small intestine, it is activated and converted to trypsin. Trypsin is one of the enzymes responsible for breaking down the protein in food into smaller pieces called peptides. Without sufficient trypsinogen and trypsin, a person will not be able to properly digest and use proteins. Any condition that prevents trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine may cause an increase in trypsinogen in the blood. 
In people with cystic fibrosis (CF), mucus plugs can block the pancreatic ducts, preventing trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine, resulting in decreased breakdown of food proteins.
Damage to the pancreas caused by other diseases, such as chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, may also cause blockages that prevent trypsinogen from reaching the small intestine. The cells that produce trypsinogen can also become damaged or be destroyed, decreasing the body's supply.
As part of a group of newborn screening tests, infants may be screened for CF using a test called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). Newborns with CF may have elevated levels of IRT.

An IRT test sometimes is ordered when a person has signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, such as:

Severe pain in the upper abdomen that may radiate to the mid-back, which usually lasts at least several hours at a time
Nausea, vomiting
Weakness
Yellowing of the skin and/or eyes (jaundice)
Fever




","



If an IRT level is elevated, a newborn may have cystic fibrosis (CF).
If the IRT is elevated, a child or adult may have abnormal pancreatic enzyme production, pancreatitis, or pancreatic cancer.
However, IRT testing is not diagnostic. There are a fair number of false positives and problems other than cystic fibrosis and pancreatitis that can cause an elevated IRT. Factors such as age at collection and race/ethnicity could affect IRT levels. An elevated level must be followed up with other testing. When diagnosing cystic fibrosis, this may include another IRT test in a month, CF gene mutation testing, and/or sweat chloride testing.
If the IRT level is not elevated, then it is likely that the newborn does not have CF. However, if suspicion of CF is high and the infant has signs and symptoms consistent with CF, other testing for cystic fibrosis, such as sweat chloride and/or CF gene mutation testing, should be considered.



","



In testing for cystic fibrosis (CF), the IRT test is only useful for screening. Additional testing is needed to establish a diagnosis.
In those who do have CF, the degree of IRT elevation does not reflect the severity of the disease.



","



Immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) is used as part of some newborn screening programs to screen for cystic fibrosis (CF). It may be used in conjunction with a sweat chloride test and/or a cystic fibrosis gene mutation panel to help identify CF.
IRT may also sometimes be used to help detect acute pancreatitis.

Depending on the test used, a respiratory sample collected on a swab from the nasopharynx or a nasal aspirate; sometimes, a nasal or throat swab


","



Influenza (the flu) is a common viral respiratory infection that causes an illness ranging from mild to severe, and sometimes can be fatal. Influenza testing detects the presence of the virus in a sample of respiratory secretions.
Influenza tends to be seasonal, usually beginning in late fall and disappearing in early spring. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), influenza affects millions of Americans each season. Signs and symptoms like headache, fever, chills, muscle pains, exhaustion, a stuffy nose, sore throat, and a cough tend to be more severe and longer lasting than the symptoms caused by the common cold.
Two types of influenza virus, A and B, cause annual flu pandemics and most epidemics. Type C can cause mild respiratory illness and is not thought to cause epidemics. There are numerous subtypes of influenza A viruses, and they are named using two designations based on the antigenic components of the virus, hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The most common influenza A viruses currently infecting humans have the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. (For more on this, see the condition article on Influenza.)
It is common for healthcare practitioners to diagnose and treat the flu without laboratory testing, especially during peak influenza season and when influenza has already been documented in an area. However, influenza testing can help rule out other illnesses and reduce the chances of people using unnecessary antibiotics, while increasing the chances that they will receive anti-viral therapy early in the illness, when it is most effective.
Also, if there is an outbreak of respiratory illness in a confined setting like a hospital, nursing home, or school, diagnostic testing will help determine the cause of the outbreak. Influenza testing also helps local and state health departments and the CDC track influenza in communities. Since the flu virus changes every year, testing also helps the CDC to monitor the subtypes and strains of flu that are circulating that year, to collect information for developing flu vaccines, and to monitor strains for resistance to anti-viral drugs.
There are several different kinds of influenza tests and they serve different purposes. Read the ""How is it used?"" section to learn more.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Sample collection technique is critical in influenza testing, and different kinds of influenza tests rely on different collection techniques. The best sample is usually a nasal aspirate, but a swab from the nasopharynx or nasal secretions may also be used. In some circumstances, a healthcare practitioner may use a throat swab, but this contains less of the virus than a nasopharyngeal aspirate and so may not be appropriate for use in rapid testing where sensitivity is a concern.
For an aspirate, the person collecting the sample will use a syringe to push a small amount of sterile saline into the nose, then apply gentle suction to collect the resulting fluid (saline and mucus). To preserve the organisms in the sample, the sample is put into a special container, referred to as ""viral transport media"" or VTM, for delivery to the laboratory.
The nasopharyngeal swab is collected by having the person tip his or her head back, then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip®) is gently inserted into one of the nostrils until resistance is met (about 1 to 2 inches in), then rotated several times and withdrawn. This may tickle a bit and cause the eyes to tear.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When it is flu season and a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether your symptoms are due to seasonal influenza A or B or to another cause; within 3 to 4 days of the onset of signs and symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, weakness, fatigue, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose and sometimes runny nose


","



Flu tests are mostly ordered during flu season (late fall through early spring), especially when a person is hospitalized, has a weakened immune systems, or is otherwise at an increased risk of serious complications. Testing is usually ordered within 3 days of the onset of signs and symptoms, such as:

Headaches
Fever, chills
Muscle aches
Weakness, fatigue
Stuffy nose
Sore throat
Cough
With some flu strains, diarrhea and vomiting
	 

When influenza has not yet been documented in the community, a healthcare practitioner may order a rapid flu test both to document the presence of influenza in the area and to help diagnose an individual's current illness.
Testing may be ordered during outbreaks of respiratory illnesses when influenza is the suspected cause.
Sometimes testing may be done when someone who died had a severe, acute illness and influenza was the suspected cause.



","



A positive flu test means that the affected person most likely has influenza A or B, and treatment with antiviral medication may be prescribed to minimize symptoms. However, it may not tell the healthcare practitioner which strain of influenza is causing the infection, how severe the symptoms are likely to be, or whether or not a person may experience any secondary complications.
A negative influenza test may mean that the person has something other than influenza, that the test is not detecting the influenza strain, or that there is not sufficient virus in the specimen to allow it to be detected. This may be due to either a poor specimen collection or because a person has had the flu for several days and less virus is being shed. New strains of influenza may be present that diagnostic tests cannot reliably detect.
Some rapid tests can further identify the subtypes of influenza A, such as H1N1, and some identify other respiratory viruses, such as RSV.
Viral cultures, if positive, identify the virus present. If the virus present is influenza, further tests can be performed to determine which strain is present and its susceptibility to antiviral agents.



","



Treated or untreated, most influenza infections will go away within one or two weeks, although fatigue and a cough may last a while longer. A few people, however, may develop serious secondary complications. These complications often arise just as influenza symptoms are fading.
Anyone is susceptible to complications from the flu, but the very young, the elderly, and people who are immunocompromised or who have pre-existing lung disease are most affected. Complications such as pneumonia, sepsis, and encephalitis can be very serious and may require immediate medical treatment.



","



Influenza testing may be used to help diagnose an influenza infection (flu) and help make treatment decisions. Sometimes influenza testing is used to help document the presence of influenza in the community or to help determine whether an outbreak of flu is occurring, especially in settings such as nursing homes and schools. Testing may be used to identify the type and/or the strain of influenza causing infections. 
Not all cases of influenza require testing for antiviral treatments to be prescribed. Healthcare practitioners may diagnose and treat influenza without testing if the person has typical signs and symptoms of the flu, plus it is the flu season and it is known that the flu has reached a community. If it is outside the 3 to 4 day window when antiviral treatment is most effective and there is no evidence of severe illness or secondary complications, the person may simply be sent home to rest, drink fluids, and soothe symptoms with over-the-counter remedies.
However, the flu can be deadly. Testing can help healthcare practitioners minimize its spread and prescribe antiviral drugs to treat patients to lessen its severity, if it is diagnosed early. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing in certain situations:

For patients in the hospital, or with high-risk conditions, who are suspected of having the flu
For cases in which an influenza diagnosis will guide care or affect actions taken to control the spread of the virus to others in close contact and/or in the community
For people who had severe symptoms and died from a suspected case of influenza

Testing is also performed to look for new strains of viruses to help prevent possible pandemics, to monitor for antiviral resistance, and prepare for the next year's flu vaccine.
Several types of influenza tests are available. The method used often depends on availability and reason for testing.

Rapid flu tests—depending on the method, a flu test may be completed in a healthcare practitioner's office or near a hospital patient's bedside in 20 minutes or less, or the sample may be sent to a laboratory, with the results available the same day.
	Rapid tests vary in their ability to detect influenza. Some types can only detect influenza A; others can detect both A and B but not distinguish between the two. Still others can detect and distinguish between influenza A and B. Some of them are able to further differentiate between the strains of influenza A, such as H1N1.

Rapid influenza diagnostic test antigen detection – these tests detect viral antigens in nasal secretions. One main disadvantage of the rapid influenza antigen test is the high rate of false-negative results. Rapid antigen tests generally detect 50-70% of influenza cases. Therefore, the CDC recommends not withholding treatment from people with suspected influenza, even if they test negative. If confirmation is needed, a negative test may be followed by a viral culture or a more sensitive molecular test. Rapid antigen tests will occasionally be positive when someone does not actually have the flu.
Real Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and other molecular tests – these tests detect viral genetic material (RNA) in respiratory samples. They are generally more sensitive and specific for the influenza virus than rapid antigen detection tests. They can more accurately detect the virus when it is present and rule it out when it is not. Depending on the test used, they will identify 66% to 100% of influenza cases. Some versions of molecular tests performed in laboratories simultaneously test for the presence of multiple respiratory viruses, such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus.


Viral culture—in this test, the virus is actually grown and further identified in the laboratory as influenza A or B and the strain present, or as another respiratory virus. The availability of viral cultures is decreasing as most laboratories adopt molecular assays to detect viral infections. Viral cultures are costly and more difficult to perform and take up to 3 to 10 days to provide a result, which makes them less useful for determining whether or not someone has the flu and for making treatment decisions. Viral cultures may sometimes be used for confirmation of a positive or negative rapid test result. Influenza virus grown in culture can be sent to a public health laboratory to determine if the strain of influenza A is H5N1, found in birds and chickens, or the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.
	 

Additional laboratory tests may be used in conjunction with influenza testing to help rule out other types of infections with similar symptoms and/or if the cause of the infection is unclear. Examples include:

RSV test—to detect respiratory syncytial virus, a virus that often infects young children and the elderly
Strep test—to check for group A streptococcus, the bacteria that cause strep throat

Inhibin A and inhibin B are hormones associated with reproduction and the development of oocytes (immature egg cells) in women's ovaries. In women, these hormones are made mostly by the ovaries and by the placenta during pregnancy. Additionally, inhibin A and/or B may be produced by certain types of ovarian tumors. In general, tumors are an uncontrolled growth of cells that may be benign (harmless) or cancerous. Inhibin A and inhibin B tests are two separate tests that measure the levels of these hormones in the blood.
Elevated levels of inhibin A and/or inhibin B may be present in the blood of a woman with a rare type of ovarian tumor called a granulosa cell tumor (the most common type of sex-cord stromal tumor). Blood levels of these hormones may also be elevated in some women with mucinous epithelial tumors. (For more details on these types of tumors, read the Ovarian Cancer article.) This makes inhibin A and B potentially useful as tumor markers. However, not all women with these ovarian tumors will have elevated inhibin A or B, so the tests may not be useful in all cases.
Most research on inhibin A and B as ovarian tumor markers have focused on postmenopausal women who normally have low to undetectable levels of these hormones. The use of these tumor markers in women of childbearing age (premenopausal) is less clear. Levels of inhibin A and B are usually higher in premenopausal women and the levels vary throughout their menstrual cycle. This can sometimes make it difficult to interpret results in premenopausal women.

When it is suspected that you have an ovarian tumor (e.g., you have a mass in the pelvic area); after you have been diagnosed with a granulosa cell tumor or mucinous epithelial tumor and before starting therapy; at intervals during and after treatment


","



Inhibin A and B tests may be ordered when you have a mass in your pelvis, and it is suspected that you may have an ovarian tumor.
These tests may be ordered after you are diagnosed with an ovarian granulosa cell tumor or sometimes a mucinous epithelial ovarian tumor and before you begin treatment. If levels are elevated, then the test(s) may be ordered on a regular basis throughout your treatment and periodically after you have completed treatment to monitor for tumor recurrence.



","



Results of inhibin A and inhibin B tumor marker tests are interpreted in the context of your medical history in addition to results of other tests, such as CA-125.
If you have a pelvic mass, an elevated inhibin A, inhibin B and/or CA-125 is a concern but does not necessarily indicate that you have an ovarian tumor. This finding would prompt further laboratory testing and medical evaluation. It is not usually possible to tell whether an ovarian tumor is cancerous until the tumor has been sampled and tested. A pathologist uses a microscope to examine the sample and determine whether cancerous cells are present.
If you have been diagnosed with and are being treated for a granulosa cell tumor or mucinous epithelial tumor, results may mean one of the following:

If your inhibin A and/or B levels are initially high and then fall during therapy, this generally indicates that the tumor is responding to treatment.
If the inhibin A or B levels rise or stay the same, then your tumor may not be responding to therapy.
An initial fall in inhibin levels after treatment is completed, with a subsequent rise in inhibin levels may indicate that your tumor is returning.

If you have an ovarian tumor and are premenopausal, then interpreting results can sometimes be challenging. This is because both inhibin A and B levels normally rise and fall throughout your menstrual cycle.



",,"



Inhibin A and/or inhibin B tests may be used along with a test for CA-125 to help determine whether you have an ovarian tumor. Testing may also be used to help diagnose a rare type of ovarian tumor called a granulosa cell tumor, and less commonly used to help diagnose a mucinous epithelial ovarian tumor.
If you are diagnosed with one of these types of ovarian tumors, blood tests to measure inhibin A and/or inhibin B may be used initially to determine whether your tumor is producing elevated levels of one or both of these hormones. If your inhibin A or B level is elevated prior to treatment, then the test may be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. The test may also be used after treatment to monitor for tumor recurrence.

Inhibin B is a hormone associated with reproduction and the development of eggs in women and sperm in men. This test measures the inhibin B level in the blood and may be used as part of an infertility evaluation.
Inhibin B is made mostly by the ovaries in females, and by the testicles in males.

In women, inhibin B is associated with maturation of follicles in the ovaries. The follicles are the structures that develop into mature eggs. Inhibin B rises and falls at different times during each menstrual cycle.
In men, inhibin B plays a role in the production of sperm in the testicles. Inhibin B levels are typically higher in men with normal fertility compared to men who do not produce an adequate number of viable sperm.

These roles allow inhibin B tests to be used as a marker of remaining fertility and ovarian function in women. Less commonly, it can be used to assess fertility in men.
Women are born with a fixed number of follicles within the ovaries that can mature to become eggs. This maturation process occurs during each of your menstrual cycles. As you age, you have fewer viable follicles and so produce fewer mature eggs. Over time, the quality of the eggs decreases as well, and they are more likely to have chromosome imbalances. Levels of inhibin B and another hormone called anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) correlate with the number of follicles you have remaining, so they are a general indicator of remaining fertility (ovarian reserve). If you are going to have assisted reproductive procedures such as in-vitro fertilization, then inhibin B and AMH levels are related to your likely responsiveness to treatment.

Inhibin B may sometimes be ordered for women prior to an assisted reproductive procedure, such as in-vitro fertilization, to help evaluate ovarian reserve.



","



The inhibin B level normally varies depending upon sex and age. Inhibin B tests are not considered diagnostic or ""stand alone"" tests for infertility. They are used in conjunction with other tests and clinical findings, such as your medical history and results from a physical exam.
If you are a woman of child-bearing age and your inhibin B level is low, then your fertility potential (ovarian reserve) and your likelihood of conceiving may be reduced. This does not mean that you cannot get pregnant, it is just one indicator to be considered with other fertility factors.
If you are a man and your inhibin B level is low, then it may be affecting your sperm production. This does not mean that you are not producing an adequate number of viable sperm, it is just one indicator to be considered along with other factors, such as results from a semen analysis.



","



Your inhibin B levels will normally be low to not detectable if you are a post-menopausal woman, but inhibin B tests are not currently used to show that you have gone through menopause.



","



This test is not routinely ordered but may be useful in specific circumstances.
If you are a woman who is having difficulty getting pregnant (infertility), then inhibin B testing may be used along with a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) test to see if your ovaries are not working well. Inhibin B may also be used along with an AMH test to evaluate your fertility potential (ovarian reserve) and your likelihood of conceiving. For this use, AMH is the preferred test and inhibin B is ordered less frequently.
If you are a man, your healthcare practitioner may sometimes order inhibin B along with an FSH test and a semen analysis to evaluate your sperm production and fertility.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Insulin is a hormone that is produced and stored in the beta cells of the pancreas. It is secreted in response to elevated blood glucose following a meal and is vital for the transportation and storage of glucose, the body's main source of energy. Insulin helps transport glucose from the blood to within cells, thus helping regulate blood glucose levels, and has a role in lipid metabolism. This test measures the amount of insulin in the blood.
Insulin and glucose blood levels must be in balance. After a meal, carbohydrates usually are broken down into glucose and other simple sugars. These are absorbed into the blood, causing the blood glucose level to rise, which in turn stimulates the pancreas to release insulin into the blood. As glucose moves into cells, the level in the blood decreases and release of insulin by the pancreas decreases.
If an individual is not able to produce enough insulin, or if the body's cells are resistant to its effects (insulin resistance), glucose cannot reach most of the body's cells and the cells starve. Meanwhile, blood glucose rises to an unhealthy level. This can cause disturbances in normal metabolic processes that result in various disorders and complications, including kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and vision and neurological problems.
Diabetes, a disorder associated with high glucose levels and decreased insulin effects, can be a life-threatening condition. People with type 1 diabetes produce very little insulin and so eventually require insulin supplementation therapy. Type 2 diabetes is generally related to insulin resistance, which increases with time.
With insulin resistance, many of the body's cells are unable to respond to the effects of insulin, leaving glucose in the blood. The body compensates by producing additional amounts of the hormone. This results in a high level of insulin in the blood (hyperinsulinemia) and over-stimulation of some tissues that have remained insulin-sensitive. Over time, this process causes an imbalance in the relationship between glucose and insulin and, without treatment, may eventually cause health complications affecting various parts of the body.
In addition to type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance may be seen in those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), prediabetes or heart disease, metabolic syndrome, acanthosis nigricans, and with disorders related to the pituitary or adrenal glands.
Other than in insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia is most often seen in people with tumor of the islet cells in the pancreas (insulinomas) or with an excess amount of administered (exogenous) insulin. Hyperinsulinemia causes low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can lead to sweating, palpitations, hunger, confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, fainting, and seizures. Since the brain is dependent on blood glucose as an energy source, severe glucose deprivation due to hyperinsulinemia can lead fairly quickly to insulin shock and death.

Insulin for injection used to come strictly from animal sources (cow and pig pancreas cells). Most insulin used today is synthetic, made by biochemical synthesis to identically match the biological activity of the insulin produced by human cells.
There are different pharmaceutical formulations of insulin with different properties. Some are rapid-release and quick-acting and others are slow-release preparations that act over a prolonged period. Diabetics may take mixtures and/or different types of insulin throughout the day.
Insulin assays are designed to measure endogenous human insulin. However, different assays react variably with exogenous (animal or synthetic) insulin. If someone is receiving insulin, these effects should be clarified with the testing laboratory. If several or periodic insulin assays will be performed, they should be analyzed by the same laboratory to ensure consistency.
If someone has developed antibodies against insulin, especially as a result of taking non-human (animal or synthetic) insulin, these can interfere with insulin testing. In this case, a C-peptide may be performed as an alternative way to evaluate insulin production. Note also that most people with type 1 diabetes will also have autoantibodies against insulin.

Monitor the amount of insulin produced by the beta cells in the pancreas (endogenous); in this case, a C-peptide test may also be done. Insulin and C-peptide are produced by the body at the same rate as part of the conversion of proinsulin to insulin in the pancreas. Both tests may be ordered when a health practitioner wants to evaluate how much insulin in the blood is made by the body and how much is from outside (exogenous) sources such as insulin injections. The test for insulin measures insulin from both sources while the C-peptide test reflects insulin produced by the pancreas.

This test, along with the growth hormone (GH) test, is used to help diagnose growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or, less commonly, growth hormone excess; to evaluate pituitary function; to monitor the effectiveness of GH treatment


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a hormone that, along with growth hormone (GH), helps promote normal bone and tissue growth and development. The test measures the amount of IGF-1 in the blood.
IGF-1 is primarily produced in the liver, skeletal muscles, and many other tissues in response to GH stimulation. IGF-1 mediates many of the actions of GH, stimulates the growth of bones and other tissues, and promotes the production of lean muscle mass. IGF-1 also plays a role in non-growth activities, such as glucose and lipid metabolism, and has been implicated in metabolic syndrome.
Since GH is released into the blood in pulses throughout the day, it is difficult to interpret the results from a single GH test. IGF-1 mirrors GH excesses and deficiencies, but unlike GH, its level is stable throughout the day. This makes IGF-1 a useful indicator of average GH levels. The IGF-1 test is therefore often used to help evaluate for GH deficiency or GH excess.
IGF-1 and Growth Deficiency
IGF-1 levels, like GH, are normally low in infancy, increase gradually during childhood, peak during puberty, and then decline in adult life. Deficiencies in GH and IGF-1 may be caused by:

A dysfunctional pituitary gland with decreased pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism)
A non-GH-producing pituitary tumor that damages cells that produce hormones
A lack of responsiveness to GH. This insensitivity may be primary (genetic) or secondary to conditions such as malnutrition, hypothyroidism, sex hormone deficiency, kidney disease, liver disease, and congenital syndromes. Genetic GH insensitivity (GH resistance) is very rare, with about 300 cases reported worldwide.

IGF-1 deficiencies can inhibit bone growth and overall growth development, resulting in a child with a shorter than normal stature. In adults, decreased production can lead to low bone density, less muscle mass, and altered lipid levels. However, testing for IGF-1 deficiency or GH deficiency is not routinely done in adults who have decreased bone density and/or muscle strength or increased lipids. GH deficiency and consequently IGF-1 deficiency is a very rare cause of these disorders.
IGF-1 and Growth Hormone Excess
Excess GH and IGF-1 can cause abnormal growth of the skeleton and other signs and symptoms characteristic of two rare conditions, gigantism and acromegaly, generally due to a pituitary adenoma, a slow-growing, often benign tumor. This causes the pituitary to release excess amounts of GH. Frequently, the tumor can be surgically removed and/or treated with drugs or radiation. In most cases, this will cause GH and IGF-1 levels to return to normal or near-normal levels.
In children, gigantism causes bones to grow longer, resulting in a very tall person with large feet and hands. In adults, acromegaly causes bones to thicken and tissues to soften, as seen with the swelling of the nose. In contrast to giantism, adults with acromegaly do not grow tall. Both conditions can lead to enlarged organs (heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, thyroid/parathyroid glands, pancreas) and other complications such as type 2 diabetes, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, mild increase in cancer (breast, colon, prostate, lung), and a decreased lifespan.

","



IGF-1 testing may be ordered, along with a GH stimulation test, when:

A child has symptoms of GH deficiency, such as a slowed growth rate and short stature
Adults have symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to a GH deficiency, such as decreased bone density, fatigue, adverse changes to lipid levels, and reduced exercise tolerance. However, testing for IGF-1 deficiency is not routine in adults who have these symptoms; GH and IGF-1 deficiencies are only very rare causes of these disorders.

An IGF-1 also may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have an underactive pituitary gland and at intervals to monitor those on GH therapy.
Less commonly, IGF-1 testing may be ordered, along with a GH suppression test, when a child has symptoms of gigantism or when an adult shows signs of acromegaly.
When a GH-producing pituitary tumor is found, GH and IGF-1 tests are ordered after the tumor is surgically removed to determine whether all of it has been extracted. IGF-1 also is also ordered at regular intervals during drug and/or radiation therapy that frequently follows tumor surgery. IGF-1 levels may be ordered at regular intervals for many years to monitor your GH production and to watch for pituitary tumor recurrence.



","



A normal level of IGF-1 must be considered in context. Some people can have a GH deficiency and still have a normal IGF-1 level.
Decreased IGF-1
If the IGF-1 level is decreased, then it is likely that there is a GH deficiency or an insensitivity to GH. If this is in a child, the GH deficiency may have already caused short stature and delayed development and may be treated with GH supplementation. GH deficiency seen at birth is due to a genetic mutation or may be due to a brain defect/trauma. Adults will have an age-related decrease in production, but lower than expected levels may reflect a GH deficiency or insensitivity.
If a decrease in IGF-1 is suspected to be due to a more general decrease in pituitary function (hypopituitarism), then several other endocrine glands and their pituitary regulating hormones will need to be evaluated to decide on appropriate treatment. Reduced pituitary function may be due to inherited defects or can develop as a result of pituitary damage following conditions such as trauma, infections, and inflammation.
Decreased levels of IGF-1 also may be seen with nutritional deficiencies (including anorexia nervosa), chronic kidney or liver diseases, inactive/ineffective forms of GH, and with high doses of estrogen.
Increased IGF-1
Elevated levels of IGF-1 usually indicate increased production of GH. Since GH levels vary throughout the day, IGF-1 levels are a reflection of average GH production, not of the actual amount of GH in the blood at the time that the sample for the IGF-1 measurement was taken. This is accurate up to the point at which the liver's capacity to produce IGF-1 is reached. With severely increased GH production, the IGF-1 level will stabilize at an elevated maximum level. Elevated IGF-1 and GH may indicate acromegaly in adults.
Increased levels of GH and IGF-1 are normal during puberty and pregnancy; during the latter, serum IGF-1 increases on average almost 2-fold. Otherwise, increased levels are most frequently due to pituitary tumors (usually benign). Excess GH can lead to gigantism in children and acromegaly in adults.
If IGF-1 is being monitored after the surgery to remove a pituitary tumor and the level is still elevated, then the surgery may not have been fully effective. Decreasing IGF-1 levels during subsequent drug and/or radiation therapies indicate that the treatment is lowering GH production. However, normal GH levels may take several years to achieve. If levels of IGF-1 become ""normalized,"" then you are no longer producing excess amounts of GH. When you are undergoing long-term monitoring, an increase in IGF-1 levels may indicate that the pituitary tumor has returned.



","



If an IGF-1 level is normal and a healthcare practitioner still strongly suspects a GH deficiency, then the healthcare provider may order another test, an IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3), to help confirm the GH deficiency. Almost all IGF-1 in the blood is bound and then transported by binding proteins, primarily IGFBP-3. IGFBP-3 is stimulated by GH and is also produced in the liver. It plays a role in the regulation of IGF-1 signaling and may be useful in monitoring recombinant human GH therapy.



","



A test for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) may be used along with growth hormone (GH) testing to help:

Identify GH deficiency; it is not diagnostic of a GH deficiency but may be ordered along with GH stimulation tests (see the Common Questions section).
As follow-up to abnormal results on other hormone tests
Evaluate pituitary function
Less commonly, to detect excess growth hormone and to help diagnose and monitor the treatment of two rare conditions, acromegaly and gigantism

IGF-1 may be ordered with other pituitary hormone tests, such as prolactin or FSH and LH, to help diagnose pituitary gland dysfunction and decreased pituitary hormones (hypopituitarism).
IGF-1 testing and a GH suppression test (see the Common Questions section) can be used to detect and monitor the treatment of a GH-producing pituitary tumor. An anterior pituitary tumor is typically confirmed with imaging scans (X-rays, CT scan, MRI) that help identify and locate the tumor. If surgery is necessary, GH and IGF-1 levels are measured after the tumor's removal to determine whether the entire tumor was successfully removed. Drug and/or radiation therapy may be used in addition to, or sometimes instead of, surgery to try to decrease GH production and return IGF-1 to a normal or near-normal concentration. IGF-1 may be ordered to monitor the effectiveness of this therapy at regular intervals for years afterward to monitor GH production and to detect tumor recurrence.
IGF-1 levels and the measurement of GH can also provide information related to GH insensitivity. Before performing definitive GH testing, if the IGF-1 level is found to be normal for age and sex, GH deficiency is excluded and definitive testing is not necessary.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a protein produced by various cells. It helps regulate immune responses, which makes the IL-6 test potentially useful as a marker of immune system activation. IL-6 can be elevated with inflammation, infection, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. The test measures the amount of IL-6 in the blood.
Interleukin-6 is one of a large group of molecules called cytokines. Cytokines have multiple roles to play within the body and act especially within the immune system to help direct the body's immune response. They are a part of the ""inflammatory cascade"" that involves the coordinated, sequential activation of immune response pathways.
IL-6 acts on a variety of cells and tissues. It promotes differentiation of B-cells (white blood cells that produce antibodies), promotes cell growth in some cells, and inhibits growth in others. It stimulates the production of acute phase proteins. IL-6 also plays a role in body temperature regulation, bone maintenance, and brain function. It is primarily pro-inflammatory but can also have anti-inflammatory effects.

The IL-6 test is not frequently ordered. C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most commonly ordered test to evaluate inflammation, but IL-6 may be ordered in conjunction with or following a CRP test when a person has signs and symptoms of an inflammatory condition or infection and a healthcare practitioner wants additional information.



","



Normally, IL-6 is not detected in the blood or is present in low levels.
An elevated IL-6 may mean that the person tested has an inflammatory condition. IL-6 is elevated with a variety of conditions and has been associated in some cases with an increased risk of disease development or worsening prognosis. An increase in IL-6 may be seen in conditions such as:

Rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other autoimmune disorders
Infections
Sepsis
Some cancers
Diabetes
Cardiovascular disease
Stroke




","



Tocilizumab, a drug that targets the IL-6 receptor and blocks the action of IL-6, is being prescribed to some patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This drug reduces inflammation and slows the progression of joint destruction. Additional drugs that target IL-6 (or other cytokines) are being researched and developed.
The usefulness of the IL-6 test in the medical setting is still being established. Medical researchers are actively studying IL-6 and other cytokines to better understand the normal functions of these proteins within the immune system and their association with a variety of diseases and conditions. The goal is to determine whether IL-6 is causing or contributing to disease states. This will show how it may be used to help in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of diseases. It may be used to help guide treatment or even as a target for the treatment of these conditions.

To help diagnose pernicious anemia, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Intrinsic factor antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that are associated with pernicious anemia. This test detects intrinsic factor antibody (IF antibody) circulating in blood.
Intrinsic factor is a protein produced by a type of specialized cells that line the stomach wall known as parietal cells. During digestion, stomach acids release vitamin B12 from food and bind to intrinsic factor to form a complex. The formation of this complex is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the small intestine.
Among having functional roles in the brain and nervous system, vitamin B12 is important in the production of red blood cells. Without sufficient intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 goes largely unabsorbed and the body cannot produce enough normal red blood cells, leading to anemia. Besides anemia, decrease in the numbers of neutrophils and platelets (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) may also occur.
Anemia that is due to a lack of intrinsic factor is called pernicious anemia. This is primarily an autoimmune condition that occurs when the body's immune system targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against the parietal cells and/or the intrinsic factor. These antibodies can damage the parietal cells and disrupt intrinsic factor production or prevent intrinsic factor from carrying out its biological function.
Two types of IF antibodies can be tested by the laboratory:

Intrinsic factor blocking antibody (type 1), which is more specific for pernicious anemia and is the one that is usually tested.
Intrinsic factor binding antibody (type 2), which interferes with the uptake of the vitamin B12-instrinsic factor complex.

The intrinsic factor antibody (IF antibody) test is not a frequently ordered test. It may be ordered when a person has a vitamin B12 deficiency and when pernicious anemia is suspected, as when a person has signs and symptoms such as:

Paleness
Weakness, fatigue
Numbness and tingling in the feet and/or hands
Larger than normal red blood cells (RBCs); sometimes large RBCs are detected before the other signs and symptoms emerge, for example, with a complete blood count (CBC) during routine testing for a health examination.

These findings usually prompt vitamin B12 and folate testing and may lead to methylmalonic acid testing (an early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency).
When a person has a decreased vitamin B12 level and increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels, an IF antibody test is typically ordered.



","



The results of intrinsic factor antibody (IF antibody) tests are often taken into consideration with the results of other laboratory tests to help make a diagnosis. When a person has a decreased vitamin B12 level and/or increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels and has IF antibodies, then it is likely that the person has pernicious anemia.
A negative test result does not necessarily mean that a person does not have pernicious anemia. As many as half of those affected will not have IF antibodies. When they are not present, the health practitioner may order a parietal cell antibody test to help establish the diagnosis. Parietal cell antibodies are not as specific as IF antibodies. They are present in about 90% of those with pernicious anemia but may also be present in a variety of other conditions and in up to 10% of the general population.



","



Some people with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Addison disease or Graves disease may have IF antibodies without having pernicious anemia. The IF antibody test is not used to diagnose or monitor these conditions.
Vitamin B12-associated anemia may take several years to develop as a normal person typically has large stores of B12 in reserve. Symptoms tend to emerge only when these stores become depleted. 



",,"



An intrinsic factor antibody (IF antibody) test may be used to help determine the cause of a vitamin B12 deficiency and to confirm a diagnosis of pernicious anemia.
Pernicious anemia is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency due to a lack of intrinsic factor. This condition occurs primarily when the body's immune system targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against the parietal cells and/or the intrinsic factor. These antibodies can damage the parietal cells and disrupt intrinsic factor production or prevent intrinsic factor from carrying out its biological function. Intrinsic factor binds to vitamin B12, forming a complex and allowing its absorption in the small intestine. (For more, see the ""What is being tested?"" and the condition article on Vitamin B12 Deficiency.)
IF antibody testing is usually used in follow up after other laboratory tests, such as a vitamin B12 test, a methylmalonic acid test and a complete blood count (CBC), have established that a person has a vitamin B12 deficiency and associated anemia and/or neuropathy.
It may be used in conjunction with a test for parietal cell antibodies to aid in establishing a diagnosis.
There are two types of IF antibodies that may be tested:

Intrinsic factor blocking antibody (type 1), which blocks the binding site of vitamin B12 to intrinsic factor. This is more specific for pernicious anemia and is the one that is usually tested.
Intrinsic factor binding or precipitating antibody (type 2), which interferes with the uptake of the vitamin B12-instrinsic factor complex in the small intestine.

Iron is an essential nutrient that, among other functions, is required for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). It is a critical part of hemoglobin, the protein in RBCs that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it as blood circulates to other parts of the body. The serum iron test measures the amount of iron in the liquid portion of blood.
Serum iron is almost always measured with other iron tests, such as serum ferritin, transferrin and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload.
The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements. Once absorbed, it is transported throughout the body by binding to transferrin, a protein produced by the liver.
In healthy people, most of the iron absorbed is incorporated into the hemoglobin inside RBCs. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the iron level in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because:

Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease
There is an increased need for iron, such as during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer)

Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms seldom appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron-deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to develop. The most common symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. (Read the article on Anemia to learn more.)
On the other hand, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron blood levels and iron storage increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron can lead to progressive accumulation and damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a genetic disease in which the body absorbs too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overdose can occur when someone consumes more than the recommended amount of iron.

Iron deficiency
The early stage of iron deficiency is the slow depletion of iron stores. This means there is still enough iron to make red cells but the stores are being used up without adequate replacement. The serum iron level may be normal in this stage, but the ferritin level will be low.
As iron deficiency continues, all of the stored iron is used and the body tries to compensate by producing more transferrin to increase iron transport. The serum iron level continues to decrease and transferrin and TIBC and UIBC increase. As this stage progresses, fewer and smaller red blood cells are produced, eventually resulting in iron deficiency anemia.
Iron overload
If the iron level is high, the TIBC, UIBC and ferritin are normal and the person has a clinical history consistent with iron overdose, then it is likely that the person has iron poisoning. Iron poisoning occurs when a large dose of iron is taken all at once or over a short period of time. Iron poisoning in children is almost always acute, occurring in children who ingest their parents' iron supplements. In some cases, acute iron poisoning can be fatal.
A person who has mutations in the HFE gene is diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. However, while many people who have hemochromatosis will have no symptoms for their entire life, others will start to develop symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, and weakness in their 30's or 40's. Men are affected more often than women because women lose blood during their reproductive years through menstruation.
Iron overload may also occur in people who have hemosiderosis and in those who have had repeated transfusions. This may occur with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia major, or other forms of transfusion-dependent anemia. The iron from each transfused unit of blood stays in the body, eventually causing a large buildup in the tissues. Some people with alcoholism and with chronic liver disease also develop iron overload.



","



Recent consumption of iron-rich foods or iron supplements can affect test results, as can recent blood transfusions.
Normal iron levels are maintained by a balance between the amount of iron taken into the body and the amount of iron lost. Normally, a small amount of iron is lost each day, so if too little iron is taken in, a deficiency will eventually develop. Unless a person has a poor diet, there is usually enough iron to prevent iron deficiency and/or iron deficiency anemia in healthy people.
In certain situations, there is an increased need for iron. Persons with chronic bleeding from the digestive tract (usually from ulcers or tumors such as colorectal cancer) or women with heavy menstrual periods will lose more iron than normal and can develop iron deficiency. Women who are pregnant or breast feeding lose iron to their baby and can develop iron deficiency if not enough extra iron is taken in. Children, especially during times of rapid growth, may need extra iron and can develop iron deficiency. Iron deficiency can also be seen in malabsorption diseases such as celiac disease.
Low serum iron can also occur in states where the body cannot mobilize and use storage iron properly. In many chronic inflammatory conditions, especially in cancers, autoimmune diseases, and with chronic inflammations or chronic infections (including AIDS), the body cannot properly use iron to make more red cells. Under these conditions, production of transferrin decreases, and serum iron is low because little iron is being absorbed from the gut and storage iron can't get mobilized, and ferritin increases.



",,"



The serum iron test is used to measure the amount of iron that is in transit in the body – the iron that is bound to transferrin in the blood. Along with other tests, it is used to help detect and diagnose iron deficiency or iron overload. Testing may also be used to help differentiate various causes of anemia.
The amount of iron present in the blood will vary throughout the day and from day to day. For this reason, serum iron is almost always measured with other iron tests, including ferritin, transferrin, and calculated total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation.

Iron is an essential nutrient that, among other functions, is needed in small quantities to help form normal red blood cells (RBCs). It is a critical part of hemoglobin, the protein in RBCs that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it as blood circulates to other parts of the body. The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.
Iron tests evaluate the amount of iron in the body by measuring several substances in the blood. These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload.

Serum iron test—measures the level of iron in the liquid portion of the blood.
Transferrin test—directly measures the level of transferrin in the blood. Transferrin is the protein that transports iron around in the body. Under normal conditions, transferrin is typically one-third saturated with iron. This means that about two-thirds of its capacity is held in reserve.
TIBC (total iron-binding capacity)—measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by proteins in the blood. Since transferrin is the primary iron-binding protein, the TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin availability.
UIBC (unsaturated iron-binding capacity)—The UIBC test determines the reserve capacity of transferrin, i.e., the portion of transferrin that has not yet been saturated with iron. UIBC also reflects transferrin levels.
Transferrin saturation—a calculation that reflects the percentage of transferrin that is saturated with iron (100 x serum iron/TIBC).
Serum ferritin—reflects the amount of stored iron in the body.

Iron is normally absorbed from food in the small intestine and transported throughout the body by binding to transferrin, a protein produced by the liver. In healthy people, most of the iron transported is incorporated into the production of red blood cell hemoglobin. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes.
When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because:

There is an increased need for iron, for example during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer)
Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease

Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron-deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, smaller and paler red cells). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop.

Conversely, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a condition in which the body absorbs and builds up too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overdose can occur when someone consumes more than the recommended amount of iron.

Islet autoantibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that have been shown to be associated with type 1 diabetes. Testing can detect the presence of one or more of these autoantibodies in the blood.
Type 1 diabetes is a condition characterized by a lack of insulin due to autoimmune processes that destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Islet autoantibodies can be present prior to the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, are usually present at the time of diagnosis, and decrease in frequency over 5 to 10 years following the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
Islet autoantibodies are markers of an autoimmune (self-reactive) response to the islets, but islet autoantibodies do not cause type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes primarily results from the body's resistance to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance) together with declining insulin production and does not involve autoimmune processes.
Type 1 diabetes was previously known as juvenile or insulin-dependent diabetes but has been re-characterized to reflect absolute insulin deficiency. When autoimmune type 1 diabetes is present, one or more of the islet autoantibodies will be present in about 95% of those affected at the time of initial diagnosis. With type 2 diabetes, the autoantibodies are typically absent.
Five of the most common diabetes-related autoantibody tests include:

Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies (ICA)
Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies (GADA)
Insulinoma-Associated-2 Autoantibodies (IA-2A)
Insulin Autoantibodies (IAA)
Zinc Transporter-8 Autoantibodies (ZnT8A)

For more on these, see ""What does the test result mean?"" under Common Questions below.
About 10% of all cases of diabetes are type 1 (autoimmune) and the majority of these cases are diagnosed in people younger than 20. However, type 1 diabetes can develop in people of any age. Symptoms of diabetes, such as frequent urination, thirst, weight loss, and poor wound healing, emerge when about 80-90% of the person's beta cells have been destroyed and are no longer able to produce insulin. The body requires daily insulin so that glucose can enter cells and be used for energy production. Without sufficient insulin, cells starve and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) results. Acute hyperglycemia can cause a diabetic medical crises (either diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state or a combination of the two states). Chronic hyperglycemia can damage large and small blood vessels, nerves, and organs such as the kidneys.

","

Any time that you have diabetes and your healthcare practitioner cannot clearly determine if you have type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes, your healthcare practitioner may order tests for islet autoantibodies.


","



A combination of these autoantibodies may be ordered when a person is newly diagnosed with diabetes and the healthcare practitioner wants to distinguish between type 1 diabetes and other forms of diabetes such as type 2 diabetes. In addition, these tests may be used when a person with type 2 diabetes is having great difficulty in controlling their glucose levels with standard treatments. In such a case, a positive test for an islet autoantibody can indicate that the diagnosis is type 1 diabetes and not type 2 diabetes.



","



If ICA, GADA, IA-2A and/or ZnT8A are present in a person with symptoms of diabetes, the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is confirmed. Likewise, if IAA is present in a child with diabetes who is not insulin-treated, type 1 diabetes is the likely cause of the diabetes.
If no islet autoantibodies are present at onset or within a few years of diagnosis, then it is unlikely that the diabetes is type 1. Some people who have type 1 diabetes will never develop detectable amounts of islet autoantibodies, but this is rare. The majority of people, 95% or more, with new-onset type 1 diabetes will have at least one islet autoantibody.
The table below summarizes the five most common autoantibody tests:



Test
Abbr
Description
Results Interpretation


Islet Cell Cytoplasmic Autoantibodies
ICA
Measures a group of islet cell autoantibodies targeted against a variety of islet cell proteins (Note: beta cells are one type of islet cell)
The presence of ICA in patients with diabetes indicates the presence of autoimmune, type 1 diabetes. ICA are present in approximately 70-80% of people with new-onset type 1 diabetes. The presence of ICA in asymptomatic individuals indicates they are at increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes.


Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Autoantibodies
GADA
Tests for autoantibodies directed against beta cell protein (antigen) but is not specific to beta cells; also known as GAD65 autoantibodies
The presence of GADA in patients with diabetes indicates the presence of autoimmune, type 1 diabetes. GADA are present in approximately 70-80% of persons with new-onset type 1 diabetes. GADA in asymptomatic individuals indicates they have increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes.


Insulinoma-Associated-2 Autoantibodies
IA-2A
Tests for autoantibodies directed against beta cell antigens
The presence of IA-2A in patients with diabetes indicates the presence of autoimmune, type 1 diabetes. IA-2A are present in approximately 60% of persons with new-onset type 1 diabetes. IA-2A in asymptomatic individuals means they have increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes.


Insulin Autoantibodies
IAA
Autoantibody targeted to insulin; insulin is the only antigen thought to be highly specific for beta cells.

The presence of IAA in patients with diabetes who are not insulin-treated indicates the presence of autoimmune, type 1 diabetes. It is advised that blood for IAA testing be drawn before insulin therapy is initiated. For the IAA result to be valid, the patient must not be insulin-treated for more than 14 days. IAA are present in approximately 50% of children with new-onset type 1 diabetes. IAA are uncommon in adults with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, IAA testing in adults is not advised. IAA in asymptomatic individuals indicates they have increased risk for the development of type 1 diabetes.
IAA test does not distinguish between autoantibodies that target the endogenous insulin and antibodies produced against exogenous insulin.



Zinc Transporter-8 Autoantibodies
ZnT8A
Autoantibody targeted against a protein that pumps zinc into insulin-containing granules in beta cells
The presence of ZnT8A in people with diabetes mellitus indicates that they have diabetes that is autoimmune (i.e., type 1 diabetes). ZnT8A are present in approximately 60% of persons with new-onset type 1 diabetes. ZnT8A are also valuable in the diagnosis of latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA). ZnT8A in asymptomatic individuals means they have increased risk for developing type 1 diabetes. The presence of ZnT8A in the blood of patients who have undergone a pancreas transplant predicts beta-cell failure.



 



","



Islet autoantibodies may also be seen in people with other autoimmune endocrine disorders such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or autoimmune Addison disease. Such individuals are then at increased risk to develop type 1 diabetes.
Testing non-diabetic individuals for islet autoantibodies is recommended only as part of a research study. In research settings, these islet autoantibody tests may be used to help predict the development of type 1 diabetes in family members of those affected. In general, the more islet autoantibodies that a non-diabetic person has in their blood, the higher their risk for later developing type 1 diabetes. If a non-diabetic individual with one or more islet autoantibodies also has a low insulin response to the intravenous injection of glucose, their risk for type 1 diabetes can be high. More specifically, in first degree relatives of people with type 1 diabetes who have ICA and a low insulin response to intravenous injection of glucose, the risk of developing type 1 diabetes within 5 years is greater than 50%. GADA has a similar predictive power. People with multiple islet autoantibodies can have a 10-year risk for developing type 1 diabetes that approaches 100%.
Because there are currently no effective therapies to prevent type 1 diabetes, general population screening for islet autoantibodies or testing of first degree relatives of those with type 1 diabetes is not generally recommended, except for research purposes.
People who are treated with insulin injections may begin to develop antibodies directed against the exogenous insulin. The IAA test does not distinguish between these types of antibodies and the autoantibodies directed against endogenous insulin. Therefore, this test is not valid for someone who has already been treated with injections of insulin. For example, someone who was thought to have type 2 diabetes and who was treated with insulin injections cannot then have this test done to determine if he or she has type 1 diabetes.



",,"



Islet autoantibody testing is primarily used to help distinguish type 1 diabetes from diabetes due to other causes. Islet autoantibodies are positive in type 1 diabetes and are negative in diabetes cases caused by non-autoimmune problems. Type 1 diabetes is a condition characterized by a lack of insulin due to autoimmune processes that destroy the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is primarily associated with insulin resistance and a relative decease in insulin production by the pancreas.
Determining which type of diabetes is present allows for early treatment with the most appropriate therapy to avoid complications from the disease. People with type 1 diabetes must frequently self-check their glucose levels and inject themselves with insulin several times a day to control the level of glucose in their blood. People with type 2 diabetes may self-check their glucose one or more times a day. However, type 2 diabetics control their blood glucose in a variety of ways. Some can control their glucose levels with diet and exercise, others take oral medications, and some need daily insulin injections.

To help diagnose bone marrow disorders known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in which the bone marrow produces too many of one or more types of blood cells


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or sometimes a sample of bone marrow


","



The Janus Kinase 2 gene, called JAK2 for short, provides instructions to cells for making the JAK2 protein. This protein promotes cell growth and division and is especially important for controlling blood cell production within the bone marrow. This test looks for mutations in JAK2 that are associated with bone marrow disorders caused by the production of too many blood cells.
The bone marrow disorders caused by JAK2 mutations are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in which the bone marrow produces too many white blood cells, red blood cells, and/or platelets. Some of the MPNs most commonly associated with JAK2 mutations are:

Polycythemia vera (PV)—the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells
Essential thrombocythemia (ET)—there are too many platelet-producing cells (megakaryocytes) in the bone marrow
Primary myelofibrosis (PMF), also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis or agnogenic myeloid metaplasia—there are too many platelet-producing cells and cells that produce scar tissue in the bone marrow

The primary JAK2 test is JAK2 V617F, named for a mutation at a specific location in the JAK2 gene. JAK2 V617F mutation is acquired as opposed to inherited and results in the change of a single DNA nucleotide base pair. In JAK2, this kind of mutation, called a point mutation, replaces the normal amino acid valine (abbreviated V) with phenylalanine (abbreviated F). This amino acid change results in a JAK2 protein that is constantly ""on,"" leading to uncontrolled blood cell production.
Other mutations in the JAK2 gene are also associated with MPNs. Over 50 different mutations have been identified. There are tests available to detect mutations in JAK2 exon 12 and to identify other non-V617F mutations.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy may be done to collect a sample for testing.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have a bone marrow disorder, including polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, or primary myelofibrosis


","



The JAK2 V617F test may be ordered along with other tests when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Testing may be done when routine laboratory test results, such as from a complete blood count (CBC), reveal abnormal results associated with these MPNs.
Sometimes people with MPNs may have no symptoms or a few, relatively mild ones that may be present for years before being recognized as an MPN, often during a routine physical. However, a healthcare practitioner may suspect an MPN and order testing when a person has, for example:

Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) or liver (hepatomegaly)
A blood clot in a vein or artery
Heart attack
Stroke or transient ischemic attack
Bleeding
Headache
Dizziness
Vision problems
Numbness
Itchiness
Gout
Kidney stones
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Weight loss
Fever

The JAK2 exon 12 test and/or a test for other non-V617F JAK2 mutations may be ordered when the JAK2 V617F test is negative and the healthcare practitioner still suspects polycythemia vera.



","



A positive JAK2 V617F mutation test, along with other supporting clinical signs, means it is likely that the person tested has an MPN. Other testing, such as a bone marrow biopsy, may need to be performed to determine which MPN the person has and to evaluate its severity.
More than 95% of people with polycythemia vera (PV) and 50-60% of people with essential thrombocythemia (ET) or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) have a JAK2 mutation, most for the JAK2 V617F mutation. Additionally, the mutation is also rarely found in people with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
A negative JAK2 V617F test but a positive JAK2 exon 12 mutation or other non-V617F mutation test along with supporting clinical signs means it is likely that the person has polycythemia vera. About 3-4% of people with PV have an exon 12 mutation.
Negative results for all JAK2 mutations does not necessarily rule out an MPN—the person may have a JAK2-negative MPN or the JAK2 mutation was not detected during testing. The JAK2 tests are performed on the genetic material found in white blood cells called granulocytes (from blood or bone marrow) and red cell precursors (from bone marrow). Not all granulocytes and red cell precursors will possess the JAK2 mutations. The proportion of affected cells will vary from person to person and may change over time. If there is only a small number of cells that have the mutation in the blood sample tested, then it is possible that the mutation will not be detected.
In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) revised its diagnostic criteria for PV and ET. The presence of a JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation is one of three major criteria listed for diagnosis of PV. However, consensus has not yet been achieved for the optimal diagnostic criteria for PV.



","



The finding of a JAK2 mutation associated with uncontrolled blood cell growth in MPN also suggests a possible therapeutic approach to some MPNs. As an example, one JAK2 inhibitor has been approved for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis.
A few laboratories offer both a JAK2 V617F test that detects the mutation (qualitative) and a test that measures how many of cells in the sample have the mutation (quantitative). Some healthcare practitioners may order a quantitative test to monitor the change in the number of cells with the JAK2 V617F mutation over time. However, the quantitative test is not performed commonly as a standard practice and its clinical utility has yet to be strongly established.



",,"



The JAK2 mutation test may be used, along with other tests such as CALR mutation and MPL mutation testing, to help diagnose bone marrow disorders that lead to the production of too many blood cells. These disorders are known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
The JAK2 mutation test is typically ordered as a follow-up test if a person has a significantly increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cells and/or platelet count and the healthcare practitioner suspects that the person may have an MPN, especially polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), or primary myelofibrosis (PMF).
The primary genetic test for JAK2 mutations that lead to MPNs is JAK2 V617F, named for a mutation at a specific location in the JAK2 gene. It is typically ordered first. If it is negative, then tests for other mutations in the JAK2 gene that are also associated with MPNs, such as JAK2 exon 12, may be used to help make a diagnosis.

To help evaluate a person's risk of recurring kidney stone formation; to help determine the underlying reason for developing a kidney stone; to determine if there is a family history of kidney stone disease; to help guide and monitor treatment


","

A 24-hour urine collection is required for this test. Frequently, two different 24-hour urine samples are collected and tested to determine whether elevated or decreased levels of a substance eliminated in the urine are temporary or persistent. Collection containers with preservative will be provided by your healthcare practitioner or the lab performing the testing.


","



The kidney stone risk panel is a group of tests that measure the elevated or decreased amounts of substances in urine that are commonly associated with kidney stone formation (nephrolithiasis). In an individual who has already had kidney stones, an increased level of one of these substances, particularly calcium, can indicate both an elevated risk for developing additional stones and the likely type of stones that would form.
Kidney stone is a term for solid aggregates of minerals and salts that form in the kidneys. Typical kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate (~75% of cases), calcium phosphate (15%), uric acid (8%), struvite (~1%), or cystine (<1%). A mixture of several types (calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate) may also occur.
Approximately 12-19% of men and 6-9% of women will develop a kidney stone within their lifetime. Fewer African-Americans (~50%) are affected than whites. The peak age in men is around 40 and in women, thirties. It is estimated that about 50% of individuals who had stone formation will have a recurring stone formation within ten years.
Kidney stone risk panels are intended to evaluate the risk of forming stones by testing for high concentrations of common stone-forming substances or low concentrations of stone-inhibiting substances. The specific tests included in a panel may vary somewhat from laboratory to laboratory but will typically include the following:

Urine pH
Urine calcium
Urine oxalate (oxalic acid)
Urine uric acid
Urine creatinine (does not cause stones but is used to tell if all urine was collected and help identify how concentrated the urine is)
Urine citrate (citric acid; this substance helps inhibit the formation of stones)
Urine cystine
Urine phosphorus
Urine magnesium (helps inhibit stone formation)
Urine sodium (does not directly cause stones but affects the amount of calcium in urine and thus its ability to form stones)
	 

A high concentration of one or more of these substances in the urine can occur when a person produces and excretes an excess amount of the substance. Other contributing factors include chronically drinking an inadequate amount of fluids, becoming dehydrated to some degree, and having unusually concentrated urine with a strong odor.

When you have had kidney stones and a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate your risk of developing additional kidney stones; when you have risk factors such as a family history of kidney stones, a single functional kidney, or a transplanted kidney


","



A kidney stone risk panel is usually performed several weeks after a kidney stone has been resolved to determine whether elevated levels of a substance are temporary or persistent.
Specifically, guidelines from the American Urological Association recommend that a person diagnosed with a first time kidney stone should have one or two 24-hour urine tests. Follow-up testing should include a single 24-hour urine test within 6 months of the start of treatment and a 24-hour urine sample tested annually or more frequently depending on whether the person has developed additional kidney stones.
Testing may be ordered after a first stone when a person is considered to be at an increased risk of stone formation or kidney dysfunction. This may include people who:

Formed stones as a child
Have a family history of kidney stones
Had multiple kidney stones at the same time as their ""initial"" stone
Have a single functional kidney, including those who have had a kidney transplant
	 

Sometimes testing may be performed when a person has made changes to their lifestyle (such as recommended dietary changes or drinking more water) or medication changes in order to monitor the effectiveness of these changes.
In addition, laboratory testing may be performed when certain conditions that have been associated with kidney stone disease occur. They include obesity, hyperthyroidism, gout, renal tubular acidosis (RTA) type 1, diabetes mellitus type 2, bone disease, primary hyperparathyroidism, and malabsorptive gastrointestinal situations (bowel resection, bariatric surgery, or bowel/pancreatic disease.



","



The results of the kidney stone risk panel are evaluated in conjunction with other tests performed in order to help determine a person's likely risk of developing another stone.
In general, if a substance such as calcium or uric acid is present in excess in both the blood and urine, then it represents an increased risk for kidney stone formation and a condition that should be further investigated to determine the cause.
Test results cannot predict, however, who will actually develop another kidney stone or when. Some people with mild elevations, or even results within normal ranges, may form stones, while other people with significantly increased results will not. A stone may be present in a kidney for years without causing any overt signs (hematuria) or symptoms (flank pain).
In a person who has made lifestyle or medication changes, decreasing levels represent a decreased risk of stone formation.
If a person is dehydrated, then the amount of urine produced in 24-hours (urine volume) will be low and the urine will be more concentrated. This can cause an excess of a substance per volume (dissolved in less liquid) and increase the likelihood of stone formation.
Kidney stone formation may be affected by urine pH (acidic/alkaline). Uric acid and cystine crystals can only form in acidic urine, while calcium phosphate and struvite stones form in alkaline urine. Struvite stones consist of magnesium ammonium phosphate and are associated with bacterial infections.
The table below summarizes what some test results may indicate:

Not everyone who drinks too little liquid or who has an excess amount of substances in their urine will form kidney stones. Some stones will form in people for other reasons. Those who have had one kidney stone are at an increased risk for stone recurrence.
Abnormalities in the structure of the kidneys and/or urinary tract may cause the flow of urine to be impeded and crystals to be deposited, leading to formation of stones.



",,"



A kidney stone risk panel is used to help evaluate the likelihood that an individual who has had kidney stones will develop additional ones, indicating a recurrent problem.
Testing is sometimes used to evaluate risk after an initial occurrence of a stone, especially if a person is considered to be at an elevated risk for forming more stones or for a person who is likely to develop kidney dysfunction if another kidney stone is formed.
This testing may be used to help guide and monitor the treatment of someone who has had a kidney stone.
Several other laboratory tests may also be used to help evaluate a person who has had a kidney stone, including:

Individual 24-hour urine tests that may not be part of the kidney stone risk panel, such as cystine, sodium, potassium, chloride, or magnesium
A urinalysis to evaluate urine constituents (substances, protein, red and white blood cells, pH, and presence of crystals or bacteria)
Blood tests such as a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine to evaluate kidney function, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate), uric acid, and calcium to evaluate health status and compare to urine results; if calcium levels are elevated, PTH and vitamin D assays may also be done.
A urine culture If a person shows signs of a urinary tract infection
Kidney stone analysis is usually performed to evaluate the specific substances present in the stone, if the kidney stone is able to be collected.

A stone or stones filtered from your urine or surgically removed from your urinary tract by a healthcare practitioner


","



Kidney stones are small, hard masses that form within the kidneys. Kidney stone testing uses one or more test methods to examine and determine the composition of the stone. This is done in order to help identify the cause of the stone and, where possible, to prevent the formation of more stones.
The kidneys are part of the urinary tract, which also consists of two ureters, the bladder, and the urethra. The kidneys filter waste out of the blood and produce urine, which is transported from the kidneys to the bladder through the tube-like ureters. Urine is eliminated from the bladder through the urethra. This is a continual process of waste filtration, urine production, and elimination.
Commonly called kidney stones, calculi can form in the kidneys and cause problems either because they grow large enough to obstruct urine flow or because they become dislodged or break off and begin to travel from a kidney through the ureter. They can cause temporary obstruction but also stretch, irritate, and/or damage the walls of the ureters. This movement can cause abrupt, extremely severe pain that may be intermittent or continuous.
Many stones will eventually pass out of the body in the urine, but some are too large or have too irregular a shape for the body to expel. With very large stones, which typically cannot pass from the kidney into the ureters, and for smaller stones that get into but do not pass through the ureters, some form of treatment will be required. The stone may need to be surgically removed, often using devices that pass through the urethra and bladder to the site of the stone. With some stones, it is possible to pulverize the stone in place using targeted shock waves. This process is called extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. The smaller particles and fragments that remain can then pass through the urinary tract.
Stones can develop for several reasons, but the most common is because there is a high concentration of a particular chemical in the urine that is no longer soluble and precipitates to form crystals. It can also occur when a person chronically fails to take in adequate amounts of fluids, resulting in highly concentrated urine. Depending on how much and what type of material crystallizes and where it forms, a kidney stone may be round, sharp and pointy or irregular with branches (called a staghorn). It can range in size from a grain of sand to bigger than a golf ball. The composition of the stone depends upon what excessive amounts of chemicals are present. It may be all one chemical compound or have different chemicals in different layers.
According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, around 11% of men and 6% of women in the U.S. will have kidney stones at least once in their life. In the U.S., more than half a million people go to the emergency room each year with kidney stones and about a million visit their healthcare provider.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The healthcare practitioner or laboratory typically provides you with a clean container and a straining device that has a fine mesh. You should filter all of your urine through the fine mesh. This is necessary because there is no way to determine exactly when a stone will pass from the urinary tract. You then examine the mesh for any particulates, keeping in mind that stones may be easily visible or as small as grains of sand. If a stone is found, it is placed into the clean container, allowed to dry, and returned to the laboratory or healthcare provider as instructed. It is important not to add anything to the stone, such as tissue or tape, as this can make testing more difficult.
If you are in a hospital, then medical personnel will filter the urine. With a kidney stone that is too large to pass, a healthcare practitioner may perform a surgical procedure to remove it.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No personal test preparation is needed. Collection filter must be available.

When a stone has passed through or has been removed from your urinary tract


","



Kidney stone analysis is ordered when you have passed a kidney stone and it has been filtered out of the urine or when a stone has been removed from your urinary tract.
Sometimes, your healthcare practitioner may suspect that you have a kidney stone and will search for a stone either in voided urine or within your body using imaging tests when you have signs and symptoms such as:

Severe pain in the side of the back that may move to the groin (pain is the primary symptom of a kidney stone)
Abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting (50% of patients will experience this)
Bloody, cloudy, and/or foul-smelling urine
Frequent urge to urinate
Pain while urinating
Fever and chills, when an infection is present
	 

When you have recurrent stones, the first stone found would be tested. Subsequent stones would be analyzed as your healthcare practitioner deems necessary.



","



A kidney stone analysis identifies the chemical composition of the stone. Common types of kidney stones include:

Calcium oxalate
Calcium phosphate
Uric acid
Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate)—stones associated with a bacterial infection
	 

These four types make up about 95% to 99% of kidney stones, with calcium oxalate stones being the most common.
Less common stones include:

Cystine—stones associated with an inherited excess of cystine excretion
Drug-related—stones that are associated with drugs such as guaifenesin, indinavir, triamterene, atazanavir, and sulfa drugs
	 

However, stone analysis does not give the reason that the stone formed.
You may have an underlying disease or condition that may produce and/or release an excess of a specific chemical into the urine. Not drinking enough fluids and/or having urine with a high or low pH can contribute to your risk of forming stones. Preventing kidney stones from developing again depends upon identifying and addressing the cause of stone formation.
In general, if you have a:

Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate stone, then it is likely that you release excess calcium and/or oxalate (or sometimes too little citrate, which normally binds calcium but does not form stones) into your urine. Calcium phosphate stones often occur simultaneously with calcium oxalate stones. The stones may be due to:
	
An inherited tendency to absorb more than the normal amount of calcium from your diet, causing high urine calcium (hypercalcuria).
Dietary factors—consuming food or drink high in calcium or oxalate may result in increased amounts of these substances in the urine.
Factors affecting absorption of nutrients, such as inflammatory bowel disease or intestinal surgery—an imbalance in nutrient absorption may result in excess urinary calcium.
Too much parathyroid hormone (primary hyperparathyroidism), leading to high blood and urine calcium.
A variety of metabolic disorders—these may lead to some degree of metabolic acidosis, resulting in an increased amount of calcium excreted in the urine.


Uric acid stone, then it is likely that you produce excess uric acid due to conditions such as gout or disorders of uric acid metabolism. Uric acid stones are more common in men and tend to occur in people with a diet high in animal protein.
Struvite stone, then you likely have a specific type of bacterial infection, often in the urinary tract, that leads to the production of excess ammonia. Struvite stones are more common in women.
Cystine stone, then you likely produce excess cystine as the result of a rare hereditary disorder (cystinuria).
Drug-related stone, then you form stones because of a medication that you take.
	 

A variety of other types of stones may be formed when an excess chemical is present and/or when the urine is very concentrated, which can occur with dehydration.



","



Not everyone who drinks too little liquid or who has an excess amount of a chemical in their urine will form kidney stones. Some stones will form in people for other reasons. Those who have had one kidney stone are at an increased risk for developing additional stones.
Other factors that can contribute to the formation or increased risk of kidney stones include:

A family history of kidney stones

To detect a KRAS gene mutation in tumor tissue in order to guide cancer therapy and to evaluate prognosis


","

A sample of tumor tissue obtained through a biopsy procedure or sometimes collected during surgery


","



This test detects specific mutations in the KRAS gene in the DNA of cancer cells and tissue. The presence of these mutations may indicate that certain drugs will not be effective in treating the cancer.
KRAS is a short name for the gene Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog. It is one of a group of genes involved in a pathway called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. This complex signaling pathway involves numerous components that relay signals from outside of the cell to within the cell to help regulate cell growth, division, survival and death.
In many normal cells, binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) on the surface of the cell is an important signal for cell growth and division. Other signals in the pathway involve a class of proteins called tyrosine kinase (TK) enzymes and a protein produced by the KRAS gene. Normally, the components of the pathway interact in the regulation of cell growth and division and do not individually stimulate cell proliferation.
However, in some cancers, EGFR becomes active even in the absence of EGF, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and division. Drugs that inhibit EGFR or tyrosine kinase enzymes are often helpful for treating such cancers. Some of these cancers, though, have a mutation in the KRAS gene that produces an abnormal K-Ras protein. The abnormal protein is always active and can stimulate cell growth even in the absence of signals from EGFR or other tyrosine kindase proteins. In such cancers, drugs that inhibit EGFR or tyrosine kinases will not be effective.
KRAS is mutated in 15% to 20% of human cancers, mostly in pancreatic cancer, colon cancer and lung cancers as well as leukemias. Approximately 30% to 40% of colon cancers and 15% to 30% of lung cancers have KRAS mutations. Currently, drugs that target EGFR are used to treat colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. KRAS mutation testing is used to determine whether these drugs will be effective in treating these cancers.
There are several different methods of testing for KRAS mutations, but all of them involve evaluating the KRAS gene in tumor tissue.

A KRAS mutation test is usually ordered when you have been diagnosed with metastatic colon cancer or non-small cell lung cancer. It may be performed at any time prior to the start of treatment.



","



If tissue from your cancer contains a KRAS mutation, then you will not benefit from EGFR targeted therapies. The presence of a KRAS mutation also indicates a likely poorer prognosis, although the presence of a specific mutation cannot predict how severe or aggressive the cancer will be.
A negative result on the KRAS test indicates that your cancer may respond to anti-EGFR therapy, but the lack of a KRAS mutation as determined by the KRAS test does not ensure this. A negative test could occur when the tumor tissue sample is insufficient or when some of the cancer cells in the tumor contain the mutation and others do not. Additionally, there may be KRAS mutations that are not detected by some tests because of their particular location in the DNA. Other factors may also lead to cancer that is resistant to anti-EGFR drugs.



","



Guidelines from both the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network have recommended KRAS mutation testing prior to anti-EGFR therapy.
Current anti-EGFR drug therapies include:

For colon cancer, anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab and panitumumab that block binding of receptors
For non-small cell lung cancer, anti-EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib that prevent activation of signaling pathways

This test detects the presence of the most common KRAS gene mutations in the DNA of cells in tumor tissue in order to help guide cancer treatment. KRAS mutation analysis is ordered primarily to determine if your metastatic colon cancer or non-small cell lung cancer is likely to respond to standard therapy, an anti-EGFR drug therapy. Tumors with the KRAS mutation do not respond to anti-EGFR therapy.
If your tumor is negative for the most common KRAS mutation, tests for other less common mutations not detected by the current test may be used to help predict therapeutic responses.

To detect high levels of lactate in the blood, which may be an indication of lack of oxygen (hypoxia) or the presence of other conditions that cause excess production or insufficient clearing of lactate from the blood; this test is not meant to be used for screening for health status.

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes, an arterial sample is collected by inserting a needle into an artery. Occasionally, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid is collected from the spinal column during a procedure called a spinal tap.
Blood lactate levels will usually be drawn either without the use of a tourniquet or with a tourniquet that is not released during the blood draw. Tourniquet use and release and clenching of the fist can increase lactate levels in the blood sample.


","



Lactate is one of the substances produced by cells as the body turns food into energy (cell metabolism), with the highest level of production occurring in the muscles. Depending on pH, it is sometimes present in the form of lactic acid. However, with the neutral pH maintained by the body, most of it will be present in the blood in the form of lactate. This test measures the amount of lactate in the blood or, less commonly, in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
Normally, the level of lactate in blood and CSF is low. Lactate is produced in excess by muscle cells, red blood cells, brain, and other tissues when there is insufficient oxygen at the cellular level or when the primary way of producing energy in the body's cells is disrupted. Excess lactate can lead to lactic acidosis.
The principal means of producing energy within cells occurs in the mitochondria, tiny power stations inside most cells of the body. The mitochondria use glucose and oxygen to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the body's primary source of energy. This is called aerobic energy production.
Whenever cellular oxygen levels decrease and/or the mitochondria are not functioning properly, the body must turn to less efficient energy production to metabolize glucose and produce ATP. This is called anaerobic energy production and the primary byproduct is lactic acid, which is processed (metabolized) by the liver.
Lactic acid can accumulate in the body and blood when it is produced faster than the liver can break it down.
Excess lactate may indicate one or a combination of the following:

Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
The presence of a condition that causes increased lactate production
The presence of a condition that causes decreased clearance of lactate from the body

When lactic acid production increases significantly, the affected person is said to have hyperlactatemia, which can then progress to lactic acidosis as more lactic acid accumulates. The body can often compensate for the effects of hyperlactatemia, but lactic acidosis can be severe enough to disrupt a person's acid/base (pH) balance and cause symptoms such as muscular weakness, rapid breathing, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and even coma.
There are a number of conditions that can cause high levels of lactate. See ""What does the test result mean?"" in Common Questions below for more information.

When you have symptoms such as rapid breathing, nausea, and sweating that suggest a lack of oxygen or an abnormal blood pH (acid/base imbalance); when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you may be experiencing sepsis, shock, heart attack, severe congestive heart failure, kidney failure, or inadequately treated (uncontrolled) diabetes; when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have inherited a rare metabolic or mitochondrial disorder; when you have symptoms of lactic acidosis such as sweet-smelling breath, belly pain, confusion or cool and clammy skin


","



A lactate test may be ordered when someone has signs and symptoms of inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) such as:

Shortness of breath
Rapid breathing
Paleness
Sweating
Nausea
Muscle weakness
Abdominal pain
Coma

The test may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects are related to sepsis, shock, heart attack, severe congestive heart failure, kidney failure, or uncontrolled diabetes.
The lactate test may be initially ordered with other tests to help evaluate a person's condition. If lactate is significantly elevated, it may be ordered at intervals to monitor the condition.
CSF and blood lactate levels may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms of meningitis, such as severe headaches, fever, delirium, and loss of consciousness.



","



A high lactate level in the blood means that the disease or condition a person has is causing lactate to accumulate. In general, a greater increase in lactate means a greater severity of the condition. When associated with lack of oxygen, an increase in lactate can indicate that organs are not functioning properly.
However, the presence of excess lactate is not diagnostic. A healthcare practitioner must consider a person's medical history, physical examination, and the results of other diagnostic tests in order to determine the cause and to diagnose the underlying condition or disease.
A number of conditions can cause elevated lactate levels. They are separated into two groups according to the mechanism by which they cause lactic acidosis.
Type A lactic acidosis, the most common type, may be due to conditions that cause a person to be unable to breathe in enough oxygen (inadequate oxygen uptake in the lungs) and/or cause reduced blood flow, resulting in decreased transport of oxygen to the tissues (decreased tissue perfusion). Examples of type A conditions include:

Shock from trauma or extreme blood loss (hypovolemia)
Sepsis
Heart attack
Congestive heart failure
Severe lung disease or respiratory failure
Fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema)
Very low level of red blood cells and/or low hemoglobin (severe anemia)

Type B lactic acidosis is not related to delivery of oxygen but reflects excess demand for oxygen or metabolic problems. Examples of type B causes include:

Liver disease
Kidney disease
Inadequately treated (uncontrolled) diabetes
Leukemia
AIDS
Rare glycogen storage diseases (such as glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency)
Use of certain drugs such as aspirin (salicylates) and metformin
Exposure to toxins such as cyanide and methanol
A variety of rare inherited metabolic and mitochondrial diseases that are forms of muscular dystrophy and affect normal ATP production (see the Related Content below for links to more information on these)
Strenuous exercise, as with marathon runners

When someone is being treated for lactic acidosis or hypoxia, decreasing concentrations of lactate over time reflect a response to treatment.
When someone has signs and symptoms of meningitis, significantly increased cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels suggest bacterial meningitis while normal or slightly elevated levels are more likely to be due to viral meningitis.
The lactate test measures the level of lactate in the blood at a given point in time. A normal lactate level indicates that a person does not have lactic acidosis, that there is sufficient oxygen at the cellular level, and/or that their signs and symptoms are not caused by lactic acidosis.



","



Increased lactate levels may be seen with thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Certain medications, including metformin and HIV drugs, can cause high lactate levels.



",,"



The lactate blood test is primarily ordered to help determine if someone has lactic acidosis, a level of lactate that is high enough to disrupt a person's acid-base (pH) balance.

Lactic acidosis is most commonly caused by an inadequate amount of oxygen in cells and tissues (hypoxia). If someone has a condition that may lead to a decreased amount of oxygen delivered to cells and tissues, such as shock or congestive heart failure, this test can be used to help detect and evaluate the severity of hypoxia and lactic acidosis. It may be ordered along with blood gases to evaluate a person's acid/base balance and oxygenation.
As lactic acidosis may also be caused by conditions unrelated to oxygen levels, this test may be used to evaluate someone who has a disease that can lead to increased lactate levels and who has signs and symptoms of acidosis. It may be ordered along with groups of tests, such as the comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), basic metabolic panel (BMP), or complete blood count (CBC), to determine if an underlying condition, such as liver or kidney disease, is causing lactic acidosis.
The lactate test may also be used as part of an initial evaluation of someone who is suspected of having sepsis. Typically, if the person's lactate level is above normal limits, treatment will be initiated without delay. If a person with sepsis can be diagnosed and treated promptly, their chances of recovery are significantly improved.
Lactate levels may be used to help monitor hypoxia and response to treatment in a person being treated for an acute condition, such as sepsis, shock or heart attack, or a chronic condition, such as severe congestive heart failure.

A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate test may be ordered, along with a blood lactate test, to help distinguish between viral and bacterial meningitis.

To help detect a condition causing tissue damage, such as a blood or liver disease, and to monitor its progress; to help stage, determine prognosis, and/or response to treatment of certain cancers; to help evaluate body fluid (other than blood)


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes a special procedure may be performed to collect body fluid from the site affected (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, etc.).


","



Lactate dehydrogenase (LD or LDH) is an enzyme involved in energy production that is found in almost all of the body's cells, with the highest levels found in the cells of the heart, liver, muscles, kidneys, lungs, and in blood cells; bacteria also produce LD. This test measures the level of LD in the blood or sometimes other body fluids.
Blood LD
Only a small amount of LD is usually detectable in the fluid portion of the blood (serum or plasma). LD is released from the cells into the serum when cells are damaged or destroyed. Thus, an LD blood level is a non-specific marker for the presence of tissue damage somewhere in the body. By itself, it cannot be used to identify the underlying cause or location of the cellular damage. However, it may be used, in conjunction with other blood tests, to help evaluate for and/or monitor conditions that lead to tissue damage, such as liver or blood diseases or cancer.
Fluid LD
Sometimes when there is injury, inflammation, or infection within a specific area of the body, such as the brain, heart or lungs, fluid will accumulate or constituents of the fluid present will change. The level of LD present in the fluid may be useful in determining the cause. For example, LD is typically high in cerebrospinal fluid when an individual has bacterial meningitis. The LD test can also be used, along with other tests, to determine whether fluid accumulation, for example around the heart or lungs or in the abdominal cavity, is due to injury or inflammation (exudate) or due to an imbalance of fluid pressure inside blood vessels and the protein level in blood (transudate). The article on Body Fluid Analysis lists some fluids that may be evaluated using an LD test.

Along with other tests, when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have an acute or chronic condition that is causing tissue damage or cellular destruction; sometimes when you have been diagnosed with cancer; when you have symptoms of meningitis or have fluid accumulation in a specific part of your body


","



Blood test
An LD level may be ordered, along with other tests such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a disease or condition is causing some degree of cellular or tissue damage. If LD is elevated, then more specific tests, such as ALT, AST or ALP, may help diagnose the condition and help determine which organs are involved. Once the acute or chronic problem is diagnosed, total LD levels may be ordered at regular intervals to monitor its progress and/or resolution.
LD levels may also occasionally be ordered when an individual has experienced muscle trauma or injury or when a person has signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia.
LD testing may be ordered on a regular basis when an individual has been diagnosed with cancer.
Body fluid test
This test may be ordered, for example, when a person has signs and symptoms of meningitis or when someone has a buildup of fluid around the heart, lungs or in the abdomen.



","



Blood test
Elevated levels of LD usually indicate some type of tissue damage. LD levels typically will rise as the cellular destruction begins, peak after some time period, and then begin to fall. LD levels are elevated in a wide variety of conditions, reflecting its widespread tissue distribution.
An elevated level of LD may be seen with:

Hemolytic anemia
Pernicious anemia (megaloblastic anemia)
Infections such as infectious mononucleosis (mono), meningitis, encephalitis, HIV
Sepsis
Intestinal, myocardial (heart) and lung (pulmonary) infarction
Acute kidney disease
Acute liver disease
Acute muscle injury
Pancreatitis 
Bone fractures
Testicular cancer, lymphoma or other cancers
Severe shock
Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)

A high LD in the blood may indicate that treatment for cancer (e.g., chemotherapy) has not been successful. A high level is predictive of a poorer outlook for survival for those with cancer.
With some chronic and progressive conditions, moderately elevated LD blood levels may persist.
Low and normal levels of LD do not usually indicate a problem. Low levels are sometimes seen when someone ingests large amounts of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).
Body fluids:

Cerebrospinal fluid—a high LD indicates that meningitis is likely caused by bacteria, while a low or normal level indicates viral meningitis is more likely.
A high LD indicates that pericardial fluid, peritoneal or pleural fluid is an exudate, while a low level indicates it is transudate. Transudates are usually caused by congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. Exudates have several possible causes and usually require additional testing to determine the cause. Read more about these tests by accessing the specific fluid article listed under Related Content (below).




","



Many things can affect LD results that are not necessarily a cause for concern. For example:

Strenuous exercise can cause temporary elevations in LD.
Hemolysis of the blood specimen can cause falsely elevated results. This may happen if the specimen is handled roughly, stored in extreme temperatures, or if the sample was difficult to collect.
If a person's platelet count is increased, serum LD can be artificially high and not reflective of the LD actually present in the circulation.




","



A lactate dehydrogenase (LD or LDH) test is a non-specific test that may be used in the evaluation of a number of diseases and conditions.
An LD blood test may be used:

As a general indicator of the existence and severity of acute or chronic tissue damage
To detect and monitor progressive conditions such as anemia, including hemolytic anemia and megaloblastic anemia, or severe infections
To help stage, determine prognosis, and/or monitor treatment (i.e., chemotherapy) of cancers, such as germ cell tumors (e.g., some types of testicular cancer and ovarian cancer), lymphoma, leukemia, melanoma, and neuroblastoma

An LD test is performed on body fluids for a few different reasons:

To help evaluate cerebrospinal fluid and distinguish between bacterial or viral meningitis
To evaluate other body fluids such as pleural, peritoneal or pericardial fluid and help determine whether the accumulation of fluid is due to injury and inflammation (exudate) or due to an imbalance of pressure within blood vessels and the amount of protein in the blood (transudate). This information is helpful in guiding treatment.

To detect inflammation in the intestines; to help identify active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); to distinguish between IBD and non-inflammatory bowel conditions; to monitor IBD activity


","

A stool sample collected in a clean container


","



Lactoferrin is protein released by a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil. When there is inflammation in the digestive tract, neutrophils are attracted to the area and release lactoferrin, increasing the level of the protein in the stool. This test measures the level of lactoferrin in stool as a way to detect inflammation in the intestines.
Intestinal inflammation is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and with some bacterial infections of the digestive tract, but it is not associated with many other disorders that affect bowel function and cause similar symptoms. Lactoferrin can be used to help distinguish between inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions.
IBD is a group of chronic disorders characterized by swollen and damaged tissues in the lining of the intestinal tract. The cause of IBD is not known, but these diseases are thought to be due to an autoimmune process that has been triggered by a genetic predisposition, a viral illness, and/or an environmental factor. The most common inflammatory bowel diseases are Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).
People affected by IBD typically have flare-ups of active disease that alternate with periods of remission. During a flare-up, a person may experience frequent bouts of watery and/or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever. Between these flare-ups, symptoms frequently subside. Many people may go through extended periods of remission between flare-ups. Lactoferrin testing can be useful in monitoring disease activity.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A stool sample is collected in a clean container provided by the laboratory. This sample should be uncontaminated by urine or water.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have bloody or watery diarrhea, abdominal cramps, with or without fever, lasting more than a few days


","



A lactoferrin test may be ordered when a person has symptoms that suggest that intestinal inflammation may be present and when a healthcare practitioner wants to distinguish between IBD and a non-inflammatory bowel condition.
Signs and symptoms of intestinal inflammation will vary from person to person and over time. They may include one or more of the following:

Bloody or watery diarrhea
Abdominal cramps or pain
Fever
Weight loss
Rectal bleeding
Weakness

Testing for lactoferrin may be performed when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether an endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) is likely or less likely to be necessary.
When a person has been diagnosed with IBD, a lactoferrin test may be ordered whenever a flare-up is suspected, both to confirm disease activity and to evaluate its severity.



","



An elevated lactoferrin level in the stool indicates that inflammation is likely present and active in the digestive tract but does not indicate either its location or cause. In general, the degree of elevation is associated with the severity of the inflammation. An endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) may be indicated as a follow-up test.
Increases in lactoferrin are seen with IBD but also with other inflammatory conditions, with intestinal bacterial infections, some parasitic infections, and with colon cancer.
In newly diagnosed people with IBD, concentrations of lactoferrin may be very high.
A low level of lactoferrin means that a bowel disorder is likely non-inflammatory. Examples of these include diarrhea due to viral digestive tract infections and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Unlike IBD, IBS does not cause inflammation. Rather, it causes cramp-like stomach pains and spasms with bouts of diarrhea and/or constipation. People with low lactoferrin results are less likely to require an endoscopy.
A moderate lactoferrin level may be seen in those with less active IBD. The result indicates that there is likely some inflammation present. If a repeat test shows that the lactoferrin has increased, then the person's condition may be worsening.



","



Lactoferrin is related to another stool test, calprotectin. Both are substances that are released by white blood cells in the stool and are associated with intestinal inflammation. Of the two tests, calprotectin has been the most extensively studied and it is ordered more frequently than lactoferrin. Usually one or the other will be ordered but not both.
A baby that is being breast-fed could potentially have a false-positive result because of lactoferrin present in the mother's breast milk.



",,"



Lactoferrin is a stool (fecal) test that is used to detect inflammation in the intestines. Intestinal inflammation is associated with, for example, some bacterial infections and, in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it is associated with disease activity and severity. The test may be ordered to distinguish between IBD and non-inflammatory disorders and to monitor IBD disease activity.
A healthcare practitioner may order a lactoferrin test to help investigate the cause of a person's persistent watery or bloody diarrhea. The test may be ordered along with other stool tests, such as a stool culture to detect a bacterial infection, a test for ova and parasites (O&P), a stool white blood cell test, and/or a fecal occult blood test.
If a healthcare practitioner suspects inflammation, then blood tests that detect inflammation in the body, such as an ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and/or CRP (C-reactive protein), may also be ordered. Testing is performed both to help determine what is causing a person's symptoms and to rule out conditions with similar symptoms. This means that additional blood and stool testing may be performed depending on the suspected causes.
If a person has been diagnosed with IBD, then a lactoferrin test may be ordered to monitor disease activity and to help evaluate its severity. For example, if a person has a moderately elevated lactoferrin, then testing may be repeated several weeks later to see if it has stayed moderately elevated, increased, or returned to normal.
A lactoferrin test may be ordered to help determine whether an endoscopy is indicated if IBD is suspected. A diagnosis of IBD is usually confirmed by performing an endoscopy (colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) to examine the intestines and by obtaining a small tissue sample (biopsy) to evaluate for inflammation and changes in tissue structures. This testing is invasive and is less likely to be necessary if inflammation is not present.

Overnight fasting is required; nothing but water is permitted. Two weeks prior to the test, you must be off antibiotics and stomach medications, such as laxatives, antacids and stool softeners. Tell your healthcare practitioner about any other medications you are taking. Avoid strenuous activities. You may be instructed to brush your teeth and/or rinse your mouth with water prior to and during the breath test.

To help diagnose lactose intolerance in individuals who have difficulties digesting dairy products, or sometimes as part of an investigation of malabsorption


","

A series of breath samples exhaled into a collector, or a series of blood samples drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Lactose tolerance tests measure hydrogen in the breath or changes in the level of glucose in the blood after a person is given a drink containing a standard amount of lactose, thus determining whether the individual is capable of proper digestion of lactose.
Lactose is a sugar with a complex structure (a disaccharide). It is found in milk and many other dairy products. Before it can be absorbed and used by the body, it must be broken down into two simpler sugars, glucose and galactose (monosaccharides). This digestion step is performed by lactase, an enzyme produced by cells lining the small intestine.
If an individual does not produce enough lactase (lactase deficient), then undigested lactose passes through the small intestine to the large intestine, where bacteria break it down, producing hydrogen gas and lactic acid. This process can cause the affected person to experience abdominal pain and bloating, flatulence (passing gas), and diarrhea within 30 minutes to 2 hours of consuming milk or other dairy products.
Almost all babies are born with the ability to digest lactose, but lactase production normally decreases as an individual ages. About 65-70% of the world's population develops some degree of lactose intolerance by the time they reach adulthood. The intolerance can vary by race and ethnicity. While only about 5% of northern Europeans are lactose intolerant, more than 90% of Asians and Native Americans become lactose intolerant.
Two different types of lactose tolerance tests are available. In both of these, the person tested is given a liquid to drink that contains a standard amount of lactose. A sample for testing is taken immediately before, and a series of timed samples is collected at intervals after taking the lactose drink.
Hydrogen breath test
This is the test more commonly used to detect and diagnose lactose intolerance. This test measures hydrogen gas in breath samples taken before and after the lactose drink. With lactose intolerance, undigested lactose reaches the large intestine and is broken down by bacteria, producing excess hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas enters the circulation and is eventually exhaled by the lungs and can be measured in the breath.
Glucose blood test
This is an alternate test sometimes used to detect and diagnose lactose intolerance. This test measures the glucose level in the blood samples taken immediately before and after the lactose drink. Since lactose is normally broken down to glucose and galactose, taking the lactose drink would normally lead to absorption of this glucose and result in an increase in blood glucose. In persons with lactose intolerance, there is inadequate breakdown of lactose and so this rise in blood glucose is not seen.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Breath samples are collected by blowing into a bag or other collection device. Blood samples are obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Fasting is required before and during testing, and you must be off antibiotics and stomach medications, such as antacids, laxatives and stool softeners, for two weeks prior to the test. There are other medications that may interfere with the test, so consult your healthcare practitioner about the medications you are taking. You should also not exercise or smoke for several hours before testing. In some cases, additional instructions may be provided by the healthcare practitioner and/or laboratory. For example, you may be asked to brush your teeth and then rinse your mouth with water prior to the hydrogen breath test and then again after drinking the liquid containing lactose. Follow any instructions you are given.

When you have symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming milk and other dairy products


","



Testing is ordered when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest lactose intolerance that develop 30 minutes to 2 hours after ingesting milk or other dairy products. Some of these include:

Abdominal pain and bloating
Diarrhea
Nausea
Flatulence (passing gas)




","



Hydrogen breath test
A baseline breath sample is taken before giving a lactose-loaded drink. If the hydrogen gas in a person's breath significantly increases from the baseline, then it is likely that the person is lactose-intolerant.
If the breath samples are negative or low for hydrogen, then it is less likely that the person is lactose-intolerant. The signs and symptoms may be due to another cause. However, some people may have lactose intolerance even with a negative result. In these cases, the bacteria in the intestine may not produce hydrogen. This can be confirmed after ingestion of lactulose, a synthetic, non-digestible disaccharide sugar that is similarly broken down to hydrogen gas by intestinal bacteria. Since lactulose is not absorbed by the intestine, the ongoing lack of hydrogen gas production suggests a false negative indicating the person may still be lactose-intolerant.
Glucose blood test
Timed samples of blood are taken and measured for glucose. If the glucose levels do not increase and the person has symptoms consistent with lactose intolerance, then the condition is likely present. Increasing blood glucose levels over the course of the test indicates that signs and symptoms are unlikely due to lactose intolerance.
Care must be taken when interpreting results of the test. People who have diabetes may have an increase in blood glucose even when they do not produce enough lactase.



","



Antibiotics taken within the last month or two prior to testing may decrease the number of normal bacteria in the large intestine and give a false-negative hydrogen breath test.
If food moves more quickly than usual through a person's intestinal tract, that person may experience symptoms suggestive of lactose intolerance because the lactose has a shorter amount of time to be exposed to and broken down by lactase.
Bacterial overgrowth in the intestines (more bacteria present than normal) can cause symptoms similar to lactose intolerance, as can a variety of other gastrointestinal disorders.
Although it is not commonly done, it is possible to test for mutations in the gene that regulates lactase production (the LCT gene). Potentially, this could identify likely lactase deficiency and take the place of hydrogen breath testing.



",,"



Lactose tolerance testing is used to help diagnose the cause of symptoms that suggest a reduced ability to digest lactose. These include abdominal pain and diarrhea following the ingestion of milk or dairy products. It may be ordered by itself or as part of a larger panel of tests when a secondary cause, such as malabsorption, is suspected. The hydrogen breath test is the more commonly ordered test. Doctors may also order this test as a part of a larger food sensitivity panel. The blood test is not ordered as frequently.

To determine your risk of developing heart disease; to monitor effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or from a fingerstick


","



Low-density lipoprotein is a type of lipoprotein that consists of cholesterol (LDL cholesterol, LDL-C) and similar substances with a small amount of protein. Testing for LDL-C often involves using a formula to calculate the amount of LDL-C in blood based on results of a lipid panel. Sometimes, LDL-C is measured directly.
Monitoring and maintaining appropriate levels of cholesterol and other lipids is important for staying healthy. A diet high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats), or an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
High LDL-C is considered to be undesirable and LDL-C is often called ""bad"" cholesterol because it is associated with cholesterol plaques, atheroslcerosis, and heart disease. This is in contrast to high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that tend to transport cholesterol from the arteries to the liver. High HDL-C is thought to protect against heart disease and so it is often called ""good"" cholesterol.

Screening: as part of a health exam with a lipid panel; every four to six years in adults with no risk factors for heart disease; youth should be tested at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and once again between the ages of 17 and 21
Monitoring: may be done more frequently and at regular intervals when risk factors for heart disease are present, when prior results showed high risk levels, and/or when undergoing treatment for unhealthy lipid levels


","



Many health organizations recommend that all adults with no other risk factors for heart disease be tested with an LDL-C test as part of a fasting lipid panel every four to six years.
If you have risk factors for heart disease (see below) or if previous testing showed that you had undesirable results, more frequent testing with a fasting lipid panel is recommended.
Examples of risk factors for heart disease include:

Cigarette smoking
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Being physically inactive, not getting enough exercise
Age (males 45 years or older or females 55 years or older)
High blood pressure (blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or taking high blood pressure medications)
Family history of premature heart disease (heart disease in a first degree male relative under age 55 or a first degree female relative under age 65)
Pre-existing coronary heart disease or a previous heart attack
Diabetes or prediabetes

Children, teens and young adults (ages 2 to 24 years old) with no risk factors should have a lipid panel done once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between the ages of 17 and 21, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
Youths with an increased risk of heart disease as adults should have earlier and more frequent screening with lipid panels. Some of the risk factors are similar to those in adults and include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight. High-risk children should be tested between 2 and 8 years old with a fasting lipid panel, according to the AAP. Children younger than 2 years old are too young to be tested.
Monitoring
LDL-C levels, either alone or as part of lipid panels, may also be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or to determine the effectiveness of drug therapy such as statins.



","



In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. Your healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of the LDL-C and the other components of a lipid panel as well as other risk factors to help determine your overall risk of heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower your risk.
Adults
Health organizations have different recommendations for treatment based on your predicted cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.
Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) recommend that a risk calculator be used to determine your 10-year risk of CVD if you are age 40 to 75 and do not have heart disease. Many factors are considered in the calculation, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, age, gender, race, blood pressure, diabetes, and smoking.
ACC and AHA recommend treatment with statins if you:

Have heart disease (diagnosed by medical history, imaging, etc.)
Have LDL-C greater than 190 mg/dL (4.90 mmol/L)
Are age 40 to 75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70-189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L)
Are age 40 to 75 years old with LDL-C level between 70-189 mg/dL (1.81-4.90 mmol/L) and 10-year risk of developing heart disease of greater than 7%

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations on the use of statins for treatment in adults ages 40 to 75 with no history of heart disease, based on risk factors (i.e., LDL-C greater than 130 mg/dL [3.37 mmol/L], HDL-C less than 40 mg/dL [1.0 mmol/L], diabetes, blood pressure, smoking) and the use of the risk calculator.

If you have one or more risk factors and a calculated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater, USPSTF recommends the use of a low-to-moderate dose statin.
If you have one or more risk factors and your calculated 10-year CVD event risk is 7.5% to 10%, USPSTF says your healthcare practitioner may choose to offer a low-to-moderate dose statin. This is because the probability that you will have a CVD event is lower, so the benefit of statin is likely to be smaller.

According to the USPSTF, there is not currently enough evidence to evaluate the utility of screening adults ages 21 to 39 for unhealthy lipid levels, or to assess the benefits and risks of statin use in adults 76 years or older with no history of CVD.
Use of the risk calculator and ACC/AHA guidelines remains controversial and is evolving as more data become available. Some say that the current risk calculator can overestimate risk. Many still use the older guidelines (2002) from the NCEP Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III to evaluate LDL-C levels and heart disease risk, as summarized below.



Optimal
Near/Above Optimal
Borderline High
High
Very High


Less than 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L); with CVD or diabetes: less than 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)
100-129 mg/dL (2.59-3.34 mmol/L)
130-159 mg/dL (3.37-4.12 mmol/L)
160-189 mg/dL (4.15-4.90 mmol/L)
Greater than 190 mg/dL (4.90 mmol/L)



According to NCEP ATP III guidelines, if you have LDL-C above the following target values and risk factors (e.g., family history, cigarette smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure), you require treatment.
The target LDL-C values are:

Less than 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L) if you have heart disease or diabetes [and ideally less than 70 mg/dL [1.81 mmol/L)]
Less than 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L) if you have 2 or more risk factors
Less than 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) if you have 0 or 1 risk factor

Youth
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the LDL-C level can be evaluated for youth with no other risk factors as follows:



 
Acceptable
Borderline

Children and Teens (ages 2 to 18)
Less than 110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L)

Low levels of LDL cholesterol are not generally a concern and are not monitored. They may be seen in people with an inherited lipoprotein deficiency and in people with hyperthyroidism, infection, inflammation, or cirrhosis.



","



LDL-C should be measured when you are not ill. LDL-C is temporarily low during acute illness, immediately following a heart attack, or during stress (like from surgery or an accident). Wait at least six weeks after any illness to have LDL-C measured.
Certain types of prescription drugs may raise or lower LDL-C levels. Inform your healthcare provider of any drugs or supplements that you are taking before testing.
In women, LDL-C usually rises during pregnancy. Women should wait at least six weeks after having a baby to have LDL-C measured.



","



The test for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is used as part of a lipid panel to estimate your likelihood of developing heart disease. If you have borderline, intermediate or high risk, results of the LDL-C test and other components of the lipid panel are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet or exercise programs or lipid-lowering drugs such as statins. LDL-C test may be also used to monitor whether treatment has been effective in lowering cholesterol levels.
LDL-C is often not measured directly but is instead calculated from other components of the lipid panel, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (see below for the most commonly-used formula). In most cases, this calculation provides a good estimate of LDL-C, but it becomes less accurate in patients with triglyceride levels above 400 mg/dL, severe cirrhosis, and other conditions. For these individuals, accurate determination of LDL-C can be done with direct LDL-C tests or special testing techniques (e.g., beta quantification).

Lipoproteins are particles that transport fats throughout the body. These particles are essential and carry a combination of proteins, vitamins, cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid molecules. The composition of a lipoprotein particle changes as it circulates in the blood. Some molecules are removed and others are added, resulting in lipoprotein particles with variable amounts of cholesterol.
Low-density lipoprotein particles (LDL-P) are bi-products of fat transport that remain in circulation for an extended time. While in circulation, LDL-P can penetrate the artery wall and get stuck, forming a fatty plaque. These plaques can build over time and lead to blockages, resulting in heart attacks and strokes. The likelihood of an LDL-P getting trapped in the artery wall increases when more LDL-P are in the blood.
Traditional lipid testing measures the amount of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) present in the blood, but it does not evaluate the number of LDL particles (LDL-P). LDL-P is often used to get a more accurate measure of LDL due to the variability of cholesterol content within a given LDL. Studies have shown that LDL-P more accurately predicts risk of cardiovascular disease than LDL-C. Researchers think that increased LDL-P could be one of the reasons that some people have heart attacks even though their total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels are not particularly high.

When you have a personal and/or family history of CVD at an early age; when the result of your low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol test is within a healthy range, but your healthcare provider thinks that you may have an increased risk of developing heart disease; sometimes to help monitor the effectiveness of lipid-lowering treatment and/or lifestyle changes


","



This testing may be ordered as part of an overall evaluation of cardiac risk when you have a personal or family history of early cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially when you don't have typical cardiac risk factors, such as high cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high triglyceride, low HDL cholesterol, smoking, obesity, inactivity, diabetes, and/or hypertension.
Your healthcare practitioner may order LDL-P testing, along with other lipid tests, after you have made lifestyle changes and/or been treated with lipid-lowering medications to determine whether treatment is working.
Although it is not generally recommended as a screening test, a few healthcare providers are ordering LDL-P along with a battery of other cardiac risk tests when they are attempting to determine someone's overall risk of developing CVD.



","



LDL-P test results are typically reported according to the testing method the laboratory uses. The report will usually include results for your total cholesterol, LDL-C and LDL-P. Additional values might include very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL-C and/or HDL cholesterol, particle and size. Since different lab methods separate the subclasses based on different physical properties (particle number, size, density, and/or electrical charge), results cannot be directly compared between methods or laboratories.
In general, the result is interpreted within the framework of a lipid profile and its associated risk. If you have an increased LDL-P, this finding will add to your risk of developing cardiovascular disease above and beyond the risk associated with LDL cholesterol.



","



It is important to remember that LDL subfraction testing is not diagnostic, not endorsed by any medical societies, and not approved by the FDA. It attempts to evaluate your risk of developing CVD, but it cannot predict the development or severity of disease in a particular person. For this reason, LDL subfraction results should not be considered when making decisions about treatment or lifestyle changes.



","



Low-density lipoprotein particle (LDL particle or LDL-P) testing evaluates LDL particles according to their concentration in the blood. It may provide useful information for assessing your cardiac risk if you have a personal or family history of heart disease at a young age, especially if your total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) values are not significantly elevated.
While for many people, the standard LDL-C test is a good indicator of risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), research has found that some people with healthy levels of LDL-C still have increased risk of CVD. Similarly, individuals with some chronic conditions such as diabetes may have increased risk even though their LDL-C is at a healthy level. For these populations, it has been suggested that the number of LDL particles might be an additional factor to consider when determining their CVD risk. In these cases, LDL-P testing may be used to further evaluate an individual's CVD risk.
LDL-P may also be occasionally ordered to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
Cautionary note:
LDL subfraction testing is typically done along with LDL-P, however, subfraction information should not guide decision-making. Laboratories use a variety of methods to determine lipoprotein subfractions, including ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, and NMR spectroscopy. None of these methods are harmonized, nor do they agree on the definitions of large versus small subfractions. None of the LDL subfraction methods in clinical use have sought Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for subfractionation of LDL.
The National Lipid Association (NLA) has specifically called out the terms ""large and fluffy LDL"" as potentially misleading as it should be emphasized that all LDL is able to form arterial plaques. Importantly, patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia, who develop heart attacks at an extremely young age, have ""large and fluffy"" LDL.
Data do not support routine testing for lipoprotein subfractions. Nevertheless, LDL subfraction testing has been used in clinical settings. No medical society has endorsed the use of lipoprotein subfractions. The National Lipid Association, the National Academic of Clinical Biochemistry, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association have all published guidelines specifically recommending against the use of LDL subfractions. The guidelines cite a lack of sufficient evidence to support LDL subfraction measurement for initial clinical assessment or on-treatment management decisions.

","

To screen for possible excessive exposure to lead, especially in children


","

Blood is drawn from a vein in the arm. Sometimes, blood is collected by fingerstick (or heelstick for infants). If test results from a fingerstick are abnormal, a second test should be done on blood drawn from a vein to confirm the results.


","



Lead is a soft metal present in the environment that is highly poisonous when absorbed into the body, affecting almost every organ. This test measures the current lead level in the blood. Approximately 1% of lead is found free in blood, so the blood lead level (BLL) may not reflect actual lead levels.
You can be exposed to lead by breathing in or ingesting lead dust or by absorbing it through your skin to a lesser degree. In adults, most lead is absorbed via inhalation, but in children most absorption occurs through the digestive tract. Once absorbed, lead is distributed to blood, soft tissues, and bone. Lead can cause damage to the brain, organs, and nervous system.
Even with long-term exposure of low levels, lead can cause irreversible damage without associated physical symptoms. In an infant, lead can cause permanent cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders, and developmental delays. Symptoms of lead toxicity are different depending on whether the exposure to lead was acute or chronic. Acute lead exposure can cause constipation, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, joint/muscle aches, headache, depression, and decreased sex drive. At blood lead levels greater than 150 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL), brain damage may occur, resulting in coma, seizure, or death. Chronic, low level exposure can cause depression, anxiety, decreased neuromotor function, anemia, and kidney damage. Chronic lead exposure has also been linked to hypertension, but the degree of association is not well established. Lead can be passed from mothers to their unborn children and can cause miscarriages and premature births.
In the past, lead was used in paints, gasoline, water pipes, and other household products, such as the solder used in canned food. Although these uses have been limited in the U.S., lead is still used in many products and industrial processes both in the U.S. and around the world. Housing built prior to 1978 may contain lead-based paint and lead-contaminated household dust. Soil surrounding these houses may also be contaminated with lead. In addition, approximately 10 million people receive their water from pipes that are at least partially lead.
Children under 3 years of age are the most susceptible to lead exposure and poisoning. Increased risk of lead toxic effects are due to an incomplete blood brain barrier, higher tendency for iron deficiency, and because children often put their hands in their mouths, accidentally ingesting lead dust or paint chips. They can also inhale lead dust and mouth or chew lead-contaminated items. Adult lead exposure is usually related to occupational or recreational (hobby) exposure. Children of those who work with lead may also become exposed when lead contamination is brought home on the work clothes of their parents.
For additional information, read the article on Lead Poisoning.

","

As indicated by a child lead screening program or physician preference, such as at 1 and 2 years of age; children considered to be at risk may need additional testing from 18 months to 6 years of age; when your occupation or hobby may expose you or your family to lead; when you have symptoms suggesting lead poisoning


","



For screening children:
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that a risk assessment be performed for lead exposure at well-child visits at 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, and at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years of age. A blood lead level test should be done only if the risk assessment comes back positive. According to the AAP and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), universal screening or blood lead level tests are no longer recommended, except for children in high prevalence areas where more than 12% of children between 1-2 years of age have an elevated blood lead level, or where more than 27% of housing was built before the 1950s.
Pediatricians may also offer screening to:

Medicaid-eligible children at age 1 and again at 2 years of age
Children of all ages who are recent immigrants, refugees, or adoptees at the earliest opportunity
A child whose parent, guardian, or provider requests blood lead testing due to suspected exposure

People should check with their healthcare practitioner and/or local health department regarding lead screening guidelines specific to the risks in their area.
Managing children with elevated blood levels:
Since fingerstick samples can be contaminated during collection of the specimen, an initial elevated result obtained by a fingerstick sample should be repeated with testing on a blood sample drawn from a vein in the arm for confirmation, and time to repeat varies based on the blood lead level measured. Follow-up testing is then used to monitor the persistence of an elevated blood lead test and is recommended whenever a child's blood lead level is higher than 5 mcg/dL.
For screening adults:

Blood lead tests may be ordered to screen adults in the workplace when lead contamination is a possibility. Family members also may be screened because lead can be carried home on clothing. This testing conforms to federal and state laws for occupational exposure.
Adults who have hobbies that involve lead-based paints, ceramics, or gasoline also should be tested. For a list of hobbies that may expose someone to potentially high levels of lead, see the article on Lead Poisoning.
Pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding may be screened if they are at increased risk of lead exposure.

For diagnosis:
For both children and adults, lead testing may be ordered when signs and symptoms suggest potential lead poisoning. These symptoms are non-specific and may include:

Fatigue 
Changes in mood 
Nausea, prolonged stomach distress 
Headache 
Tremors
Weight loss 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Anemia 
Encephalopathy, memory loss, seizures, coma

Many children have no physical symptoms at the time of the exposure, but potentially permanent damage can still be occurring. Testing for lead exposure should be considered in children who grow slower than children the same age or who have anemia, sleep problems, hearing loss, or speech, language or attention deficits.



","



The higher the test result, the more lead there is in the blood. However, the amount of lead in the blood does not necessarily reflect the total amount of lead in the body. This is because most lead is stored in bones and teeth. The danger that a particular lead level represents depends on the age and health of the person, the amount of lead they are exposed to, and the amount of time that they are exposed to elevated lead levels.
Children
Exposure to lead is not healthy for anyone, but children are more vulnerable to its effects. The CDC uses a blood lead reference value (BLL) of 5 mcg/dL (five micrograms per deciliter) to identify children with lead levels much higher than most children. Children with elevated blood lead levels should prompt responses that include environmental assessments to determine the source of lead source exposure, educating family members about lead poisoning, and instituting follow-up testing to monitor the condition. Children should also be assessed for iron deficiency and general nutrition consistent with AAP guidelines. Blood lead levels will need to be monitored over time until the environmental investigations and subsequent responses are complete.
Children with blood lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL need evaluation and chelation treatment (chelation). Chelation treatment consists of giving a medication orally that binds lead and eliminates it through the urine. Some children may not be able to take this medication and will require treatment with calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) via injection. Children with an initial blood lead level greater than 70 mcg/dL will typically require hospitalization and immediate intervention.
Adults
In 2015, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) designated 5 mcg/dL or above as an elevated blood lead level in adults. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends that blood lead levels among all adults be reduced to less than 10 mcg/dL.
Because lead will pass through the blood to an unborn child, pregnant women need to limit their exposure to lead to maintain a low blood level and as close to zero as possible to protect the developing fetus.
Any lead level greater than 70 mcg/dL should be considered a medical emergency.



","



Lead interferes with the absorption of iron. Children with raised blood lead concentrations should be tested for iron deficiency.
Each person eliminates lead differently. Thus, laboratory tests are just one part of the picture in lead poisoning cases. Careful monitoring with medical examinations is needed. Patients with altered kidney function may not eliminate lead as quickly.
Healthcare practitioners should be aware that cultural practices and folk remedies, including soil ingestion, can increase the risk of lead exposure. Folk remedies prepared by newly immigrated populations from Southeast Asia are particularly known as possible sources of lead. Other potential lead sources include imported foods, candy, cosmetics, costume jewelry, brass keys, and toys or household items containing or painted with lead.



","



The lead test is used to determine the concentration of lead in the blood at the time the sample was collected. The blood lead test is used to screen for exposure to lead. It may also be ordered to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to confirm that lead levels are decreasing over time.
Lead concentrations are monitored at the local level following state and national standards. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and a variety of other organizations make recommendations regarding screening children for lead exposure.
Blood lead is monitored in workers whose environment contains lead. It is used to evaluate chronic lead exposure and recent lead exposure. Sometimes, a zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) test is also ordered. The ZPP is increased when lead begins to affect red blood cell production. It is not sensitive enough to use as a screening tool for children, but it may be ordered to help evaluate average lead exposure in adults over the last several weeks. ZPP may also be ordered when a person shows signs of lead toxicity, but their BLL is not increased to a level to account for these symptoms.

legionella-testing,"['Legionella pneumophila', 'Legionnaires Disease or Legionellosis Testing']","

","

To detect and diagnose Legionella bacteria as the cause of pneumonia or flu-like symptoms; to investigate an outbreak caused by Legionella


","

A urine sample, a sputum sample, blood sample, and/or respiratory secretions or other body fluids collected by a healthcare practitioner


","



Legionella is a type of bacteria that can cause a serious form of pneumonia called Legionnaires disease. Legionella testing detects the presence of the bacteria or parts of it (antigens) to help diagnose the cause of a person's pneumonia.
A legionella infection affects the lower respiratory tract, often requires hospitalization, and has a significant mortality rate. In addition to pneumonia, Legionella bacteria can also cause Pontiac fever, a milder and self-limiting illness with flu-like symptoms (without pneumonia). Together, Legionnaires disease and Pontiac fever are referred to as legionellosis.
Legionella bacteria are found naturally throughout the environment. They prefer warm, stagnant water and can grow in the plumbing systems of large buildings such as hotels, hospitals, and cruise ships. The bacteria may contaminate whirlpool spas, drinking and bathing water, hot water tanks, air conditioning cooling towers, ice machines, humidifiers, and public fountains.
Infections occur when an individual inhales airborne water droplets such as steam or mist that are contaminated with Legionella bacteria. The bacteria are not passed from one person to another, but many people can become infected by the same contaminated water source, potentially resulting in a legionellosis outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), legionellosis outbreaks occur any time two or more people become ill in the same place at about the same time.
Legionella infection or Pontiac fever is confirmed when a person showing typical symptoms of the disease has a positive confirmatory laboratory test (usually a positive culture or urine test).
State and local health departments have jurisdiction over legionellosis outbreaks in their state; however, legionellosis is a nationally notifiable disease and state health departments should report all laboratory-confirmed cases to the CDC.
Pontiac fever typically develops within 24-48 hours while Legionnaires disease develops within a few days to a couple of weeks. According to the CDC, about 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaires disease each year. The actual number of people affected by legionellosis is likely much higher as most cases of Pontiac fever and many cases of Legionnaires disease are thought to go undiagnosed.
Although anyone may be affected, adults over 50 are at the highest risk for Legionnaires disease, as are those who smoke, have lung diseases, or have compromised immune systems (such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or who are taking immunosuppressant medications). People with chronic underlying diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, or liver disease are also more vulnerable, and men are affected more often than women. Most cases of Legionnaires disease are sporadic, but they may also be seen in outbreaks, which typically occur during the summer and early fall. Pontiac fever is frequently linked with outbreaks.
There are many different types of Legionella bacteria, but only a few are common. In the United States, as many as 80% of legionella infections in adults are caused by Legionella pneumophila, serogroup 1 (a subtype of the species). Other serogroups of L. pneumophila, including 4 and 6, cause a number of cases. Other species of Legionella, such as Legionella micdadei, Legionella bozemanii, Legionella dumoffii, and Legionella longbeachae, may cause infections in children and/or are more prevalent in other parts of the world.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The sample collected depends on the test to be performed.

For antigen testing, a random urine sample is collected in a sterile cup provided by the laboratory or healthcare practitioner's office.
For culture or molecular testing, a sputum sample may be expectorated or induced. Expectorated samples are coughed up and expelled into a sterile cup provided by the laboratory or health practitioner's office. The person's mouth should be rinsed with water or saline prior to sample collection. Deep coughing is generally required, and the person should be informed that it is phlegm/mucus from the lungs that is necessary, not saliva. If someone cannot produce a sputum sample, then it can often be induced by inhaling a sterile saline or glycerin aerosol for several minutes to loosen phlegm in the lungs. Respiratory secretions, other body fluid samples, and any tissue biopsy samples are collected by a healthcare practitioner.

Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have a cough, body aches, shortness of breath, headache, and fever with chills, and may have abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and/or mental changes that a healthcare provider suspects may be due to an infection caused by Legionella


","



Legionella testing may be ordered when a person has pneumonia or symptoms associated with pneumonia, especially when the person also has gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and/or nausea and mental changes such as confusion.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing when a person:

Has severe pneumonia, especially if the person is in intensive care
Has pneumonia and has a weakened immune system
Has been treated with antibiotics in an outpatient setting but is still ill
Has pneumonia during a legionellosis outbreak
Has become ill and traveled away from home within the past two weeks
Is suspected of acquiring pneumonia in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or nursing home
	 

Signs and symptoms of Legionnaires disease typically include:

Cough (dry or productive, may have bloody sputum)
Headache
High fever, chills
Weakness, fatigue
Muscle aches
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Lethargy
Mental changes, confusion
	 

and may include:

Watery diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
	 

and sometimes:

Low blood pressure
Changes in heart rate
	 

Additional symptoms may be experienced if Legionella bacteria also infect other organs such as the heart, brain, liver, or kidney.



","



Results of testing must be carefully interpreted and evaluated in conjunction with a complete medical history, physical exam, and other tests such as a chest X-ray for pneumonia.
Negative legionella test results, of any type, do not rule out a legionella infection. A person may be infected by a Legionella species other than the one(s) tested or the bacteria may be present in the sample in numbers too low to be detected or may not have grown in culture. Repeat testing may be required.
If a Legionella pneumophila urine antigen test is positive, then it is likely that a person has a Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection. If the person has symptoms consistent with pneumonia, then it is likely that the person has Legionnaires disease.
If a legionella culture is positive, then a person is confirmed as having a legionella infection and whatever species is present in the culture is identified as the cause.
If a Legionella species by PCR genetic test is positive, then it is likely that the person has a legionella infection. However, there are a small number of false positives associated with this test.



","



Legionella pneumophila by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) is a test that is no longer routinely recommended. It is not as sensitive as other testing, is labor-intensive, and requires a relatively large respiratory sample.



",,"



Testing is performed to detect the presence of Legionella bacteria to identify the cause of a person's symptoms. Tests are primarily used to diagnose Legionnaires disease and distinguish it from other causes of pneumonia and/or other conditions that have similar symptoms. Since Legionnaires disease can often require hospitalization and has a significant mortality rate, it is important for a healthcare practitioner to identify it and initiate appropriate treatment with antibiotics.  
Typically, one or more of the following tests may be ordered. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a urine test for the Legionella antigen and Legionella culture of a respiratory sample are the preferred tests to diagnose Legionnaires disease and are used to confirm cases showing typical clinical features of Legionellosis.

Legionella pneumophila antigen—this is the preferred initial test for Legionnaires disease. It detects one of the bacterium's proteins. It is performed on urine and occasionally on another body fluid. It is a rapid way to detect an infection, but it will only detect Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1. Since this is the most common cause of Legionnaires disease in the U.S., it will detect most infections in adults.
Legionella culture—this type of culture may be performed along with a routine sputum culture because special nutrient media is required to encourage the growth of Legionella and discourage the growth of other bacteria. This test is considered the ""gold standard"" for diagnosing an infection caused by Legionella bacteria. A positive culture may be determined in about 48 to 72 hours. Negative cultures are held for at least 7 days before a final result is reported. A culture will identify multiple Legionella species and is used both to confirm that a person has a legionella infection and to help identify the source of an outbreak.
Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining for Legionella species—this is a rapid test that can be performed on respiratory samples and tissue and requires only 2 to 4 hours for results.
Legionella species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—this test detects bacterial genetic material, primarily in respiratory secretions but sometimes in other body fluids. It can detect several species of Legionella but is not widely used.

leptin,,"

None


","

To determine if you have a leptin deficiency that is contributing to obesity; to identify increased leptin; on a research basis to help understand leptin's roles in the body and its ties to obesity


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Leptin is a hormone that helps regulate appetite by signaling hunger satisfaction (satiety). This test measures the amount of leptin in the blood to detect a deficiency that may be contributing to obesity.
Leptin is produced primarily by fat cells (adipocytes) and to a lesser degree by other tissues, including the placenta in pregnant women. It is transported in the blood receptors in the hypothalamus in the brain. When sufficient food has been consumed, it tells the body that it is no longer hungry. In a normal feedback response, a low level of leptin triggers hunger and an increase in food consumption. As the level of leptin rises from an increase in fat cells, hunger diminishes and food consumption drops off.
Insufficient leptin can cause persistent hunger as the body attempts to protect itself from perceived underfeeding (starvation). Very rare inherited leptin deficiencies can cause severe obesity through constant hunger and constant eating that starts in early childhood. Leptin replacement therapy has been shown to be successful in treating some of those affected.
Obesity is most commonly associated with elevated leptin levels. This is thought to be due to a resistance to leptin that is similar to the insulin resistance often seen with obesity. People who are affected are resistant to the action of leptin—they continue to experience hunger even after consuming sufficient food. The body continues to produce more leptin in an attempt to compensate and in response to the perceived hunger. However, about 10% of those who are obese are estimated to have some degree of leptin deficiency.
There is significant interest in better understanding leptin's ties to obesity. Obesity is a major health concern in the U.S. because it increases the risk of many conditions, such as high blood pressure (hypertension), dyslipidemias (high cholesterol and/or high triglycerides), type 2 diabetes, joint problems, sleep apnea, coronary heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. The rate of obesity has increased steadily over the last 20 years in all age ranges and, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than one-third of adults and 17% of children and teens in this country are currently classified as obese. Classification is based on body mass index or BMI. (See Common Questions below).
A recent study found that in some people a leptin level might be more accurate than the traditional body mass index in gauging how much excess fat a person is carrying. In general, the higher the level of leptin in the bloodstream, the more fat tissue a person has. In the study, this was especially true with older women and in those with large muscles or dense bones where the results of the BMI score could be misleading.
Research is ongoing to evaluate leptin's roles in the body and the links between leptin and obesity, and between leptin and successful weight loss. There is also continued interest in determining whether a leptin-based treatment might be useful for those who are obese and leptin-deficient.

When a child has severe obesity that may be due to a very rare inherited leptin deficiency; sometimes to help evaluate obesity; when participating in a research study

Leptin is primarily ordered during clinical studies, when it is performed to further investigate the role of leptin.
Leptin testing is not frequently ordered outside of a research setting, but it may sometimes be ordered when a child has been classified as obese, especially when there is a family history of early-onset obesity. (For classifications, see Common Questions below.)
Some doctors may order a leptin test when evaluating an obese person to determine whether they may have a leptin deficiency or an excess (to detect leptin resistance).



","



In the obese, decreased leptin levels may indicate some degree of deficiency, while increased concentrations are thought to be associated with resistance to the effects of leptin. Most obese people will have increased levels, but about 10% may have some degree of leptin deficiency.
Very rarely, significantly decreased leptin levels may indicate an inherited leptin deficiency linked to severe obesity.
Leptin secretion follows a circadian pattern, meaning that the concentration in blood will vary throughout a 24-hour time period (higher at night than during the day).



","



Women normally have higher leptin levels than men. Leptin concentrations are also increased during pregnancy and may be significantly increased in women with gestational diabetes or preeclampsia. The test is not, however, used to monitor these conditions.
The usefulness of leptin results in a medical setting, especially in evaluating excess or and deficient amounts of the hormone, is yet to be fully established. For instance, someone with a rare inherited deficiency may benefit from leptin replacement therapy, but there is not yet sufficient data to determine whether or not a person with a mild deficiency would also benefit from a targeted treatment.
Some of the other topics that have been or are being studied in association with leptin include its:

Contribution to inflammation and atherosclerosis or, conversely, its protection from atherosclerosis
Increase with gestational diabetes and with pre-eclampsia during pregnancy
Role in fertility
Association with depression, stress, and anxiety
Role in maintaining glucose levels and its interaction with insulin
Association between leptin levels, weight loss, and hunger




",,"



The leptin test is not ordered routinely and its usefulness in medical settings is yet to be fully established. Most testing is still performed in a research setting as the role of leptin is further investigated.
In clinical settings, the leptin test is most likely to be ordered on an obese child, especially if there is a family history of early-onset obesity. It may sometimes be ordered on an obese person who has symptoms of frequent, persistent hunger to detect a leptin deficiency or excess.
On occasion, the test may be used along with other tests, such as a lipid profile, thyroid panel, glucose, insulin, and/or A1c, to evaluate the health status of an obese person and to detect underlying conditions that may be contributing to or complicating their condition.

Levetiracetam is a drug that is used to treat certain seizure disorders (epilepsy) such as: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, temporal lobe epilepsy, complex partial seizures, myoclonic seizures, refractory seizures, secondarily generalized seizures, simple partial seizures, tonic-clonic seizures. The drug is prescribed as a secondary (adjunctive) treatment in combination with other antiepileptic drugs. This test measures the level of levetiracetam in the blood.
Epilepsy affects the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, a person may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to occasional seizures, to recurrent seizures. Seizures are categorized by the parts of the brain and body that are affected. Levetiracetam is prescribed to help prevent specific types of recurrent seizures.
Levetiracetam is one of several newer second-generation antiepileptic drugs. It has a wider therapeutic range than many existing first-generation seizure medications. That is, the range of concentration in the blood in which the drug is effective without being toxic is broader, making it somewhat safer. It is also associated with fewer severe side effects and does not interact with as many other drugs. Levetiracetam provides a combination of effectiveness and safety that is superior to other treatment choices in many clinical circumstances.
Because levetiracetam has a wider therapeutic range, it does not need to be monitored in the same manner as first-generation antiepileptic drugs. (For further discussion of this, see the article on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.)
At the start of therapy, doses of levetiracetam may be gradually increased until a standard amount is reached. Once a stable dose is achieved, a blood level may be measured to ensure that it is within the therapeutic range. Since levetiracetam is an adjunct (secondary) medication, the healthcare practitioner will consider the effectiveness of both drugs that are prescribed and adjust them as necessary.

After a stable dose is initially achieved; when indicated to detect low or excessive (potentially toxic) levels; when you have decreased kidney function; sometimes to verify compliance


","



Levetiracetam tests may occasionally be ordered:

After you begin taking the drug and a stable dose is achieved
When your dose is changed
When you start or stop taking additional medications in order to judge their effects, if any, on the levetiracetam level
When it appears you are not responding to therapy and have a recurrence of seizures
When you experience a troublesome level of side effects and/or develop complications; side effects may be seen at any dose but are usually related to higher concentrations. The most common side effects include:
	
Adults: sleepiness or drowsiness, weakness or lack of energy, infection and dizziness
Children: fatigue, aggression, nasal congestion, decreased appetite, and irritability



Tests may be ordered periodically when you have decreased kidney function, an underlying condition that may affect kidney function, and/or significant liver dysfunction.



","



The therapeutic range for levetiracetam is about 12.0 - 46.0 mcg/mL (mg/L). Levels above 46 mcg/mL are considered potentially toxic. However, ranges vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory, and toxic levels have not been well established.
You and your healthcare practitioners should use the therapeutic ranges and units established by the laboratory that performs your testing. Results should be interpreted in the context of the clinical picture, including evidence of drug effectiveness and/or toxicity.
Within the therapeutic range, most people will respond to the drug without excessive side effects; however, response varies with each individual. Some people will experience seizures at the low end of the therapeutic range, some will experience excessive side effects at the upper end, and some will require dosages outside of the established range for effectiveness and/or freedom from side effects. You should work closely with your healthcare practitioner to find the dose that works the best for you.
In general, if levetiracetam test results are within the therapeutic range (or at an individually established level) and you are not having recurrent seizures and not experiencing significant side effects, then the drug dose is considered adequate.
A level that is outside the therapeutic range may mean you are not taking the drug as prescribed by your healthcare practitioner. This is important to know, as this may put you at increased risk of experiencing symptoms.



","



It's important to take this medicine regularly. Missing doses may trigger a seizure. People should not increase, decrease, or stop taking their medication without consulting with their healthcare practitioners. Dosage determinations and adjustments must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.



","



This test is used to measure the level of levetiracetam in the blood to determine whether the level of drug is within the therapeutic range. Initially, the test may be ordered to help establish the appropriate dose for you. Since the therapeutic range is relatively wide and not well established, your healthcare practitioner will evaluate the effectiveness of the dose in controlling your seizures and whether you have any side effects. Depending on these clinical findings and the results of the blood test, the dose of drug may be adjusted up or down.
Routine periodic monitoring of levetiracetam is usually not required. However, there are circumstances in which it is useful and sometimes necessary to measure blood levels. Some of these include:

To establish the therapeutic range for an individual (dose individualization); after treatment has started and you have relief from symptoms (no seizures) and suffers no side effects, the level of the drug in the blood is determined. The range around this value is considered therapeutic for you and may be used to evaluate your treatment in the future if your health status or other factors change.
To verify that your symptoms (seizures or side effects) are not due to too little or too much drug
To verify that you are taking the medication as prescribed
To evaluate and adjust the dose as necessary in certain conditions such as:
	
Kidney disease—levetiracetam is cleared from the body by the kidneys, so anything that affects kidney function can affect blood levels of the drug.
A change or addition of other drugs
Aging—people typically are prescribed seizure medications for their lifetime and, as they age, the amount of drug needed to be effective may change.
Pregnancy—this condition can temporarily affect drug breakdown (metabolism) and clearance.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm

Lipase is an enzyme primarily produced by the pancreas to help digest dietary fats. This test measures the amount of lipase in the blood.
The pancreas is a narrow, flat organ about six inches long located deep within the abdominal cavity, below the liver and between the stomach and the spine. Its head section connects to the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. Inside the pancreas, small ducts (tubes) feed digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas into the pancreatic duct. Lipase is transported through the pancreatic duct and into the first part of the small intestine, where it helps break down dietary triglycerides (a form of fat) into fatty acids.
Lipase is usually present in the blood in small quantities. When cells in the pancreas are injured, increased amounts of lipase enter the blood and result in higher concentrations in the blood. This can occur in conditions such as pancreatitis, or when the pancreatic duct is blocked by a gallstone or, in rare cases, by a pancreatic tumor.

","

When you have symptoms of a pancreatic disorder, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, or nausea


","



A lipase test may be ordered when a person has symptoms of acute pancreatitis or another pancreatic disorder, such as:

Severe upper abdominal or back pain that radiates to the back or feels worse after eating
Fever
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Yellowing of the eyes or skin (jaundice)
Rapid pulse
Loose, fatty, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea)

It may also be ordered at intervals when a healthcare practitioner wants to monitor someone with a pancreatic condition to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and to determine whether the lipase levels are increasing or decreasing over time.



","



A high lipase level in the blood may indicate the presence of a condition affecting the pancreas.
In acute pancreatitis, lipase levels are frequently very high, often 3 to 10 times higher than the highest reference value (often called the upper limit of normal). Lipase concentrations typically rise within 3 to 6 hours of an acute pancreatic attack, peak at 24 hours, and remain elevated for up to 8 to 14 days. Lipase levels cannot be used to determine the severity of an acute pancreatic attack.
Lipase levels may also be increased with pancreatic duct obstruction, pancreatic cancer, and other pancreatic diseases, as well as with gallbladder inflammation or kidney disease.
A low level of lipase in the blood may indicate permanent damage to the lipase-producing cells in the pancreas. This can occur in chronic diseases that affect the pancreas, such as cystic fibrosis.



","



The pancreas is the primary source of lipase, but cells in other areas of the body involved with digestion and nutrient absorption also produce lipase, including those in the tongue, stomach and liver.
Drugs that may increase lipase levels include pain medications like codeine, indomethacin, and morphine, birth control pills, thiazide diuretics, and cholinergic drugs, among others.



","



The blood test for lipase is most often used to help diagnose and monitor acute pancreatitis. It may also be used to diagnose and monitor chronic pancreatitis and other disorders that involve the pancreas.
The lipase test may be used along with a blood amylase test to detect pancreatic diseases. While the amylase test is sensitive for pancreatic diseases, it is not specific. That means an elevated amylase level may indicate a problem, but the cause may not be related to the pancreas. The lipase test, on the other hand, is more specific than amylase for diseases of the pancreas, particularly for acute pancreatitis and for acute alcoholic pancreatitis. An elevated lipase usually indicates a problem with the pancreas. Evaluating the results of the two tests together helps to diagnose or rule out pancreatitis and other conditions.
Lipase testing is also occasionally used in the diagnosis and follow-up of cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, and Crohn disease.

lipid-panel,"['Coronary Risk Panel', 'Lipid Profile', 'Fasting Lipid Panel', 'Non-fasting Lipid Panel', 'Cholesterol Panel', 'Lipid Test']","

Typically, fasting for 9-12 hours (drinking water only) before having your blood drawn is required, but some healthcare practitioners allow non-fasting lipid testing. In particular, children, teens and young adults (ages 2 to 24) may have testing done without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted.

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein. Sometimes a drop of blood is collected by puncturing the skin on a fingertip. This fingerstick sample is typically used when a lipid panel is being measured on a portable testing device, for example, at a health fair.


","



Lipids are a group of fats and fat-like substances that are important constituents of cells and sources of energy. A lipid panel measures the level of specific lipids in the blood.
Two important lipids, cholesterol and triglycerides, are transported in the blood by lipoproteins (also called lipoprotein particles). Each type of lipoprotein contains a combination of cholesterol, triglyceride, protein, and phospholipid molecules. The particles measured with a lipid panel are classified by their density into high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).
A lipid panel typically includes:

Total cholesterol—measures all the cholesterol in all the lipoprotein particles
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)—measures the cholesterol in HDL particles; often called ""good cholesterol"" because HDL-C takes up excess cholesterol and carries it to the liver for removal.
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)—calculates or measures the cholesterol in LDL particles; often called ""bad cholesterol"" because it deposits excess cholesterol in walls of blood vessels, which can contribute to atherosclerosis. Usually, the amount of LDL-C is calculated using the results of total cholesterol, HDL-C, and triglycerides.
Triglycerides—measures all the triglycerides in all the lipoprotein particles; most is in the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).

Some other information may be reported as part of the lipid panel. These parameters are calculated from the results of the tests listed above.

Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C)—calculated from triglycerides/5; this formula is based on the typical composition of VLDL particles.
Non-HDL-C—calculated from total cholesterol minus HDL-C
Cholesterol/HDL ratio—calculated ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-C

An extended profile (or advanced lipid testing) may also include low-density lipoprotein particle number or concentration (LDL-P). This test measures the number of LDL particles, rather than measuring the amount of LDL-cholesterol. It is thought that this value may more accurately reflect heart disease risk in certain people. (For more, see the article on LDL Particle Testing).
Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of these lipids is important in staying healthy. While the body produces the cholesterol needed to function properly, the source for some cholesterol is the diet. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increasing the risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
A high level of triglycerides in the blood is also associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood.

Screening when no risk factors present: for adults, every four to six years; for children, teens and young adults, once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21
Monitoring: at regular intervals when you have risk factors, when prior results showed high risk levels, and/or to monitor effectiveness of treatment


","



Adults with no other risk factors for heart disease should be tested with a fasting lipid panel once every four to six years.
If you have risk factors or if previous testing showed that you had a high cholesterol level, more frequent testing with a full lipid panel is recommended.
Examples of risk factors other than high LDL-C include:

Cigarette smoking
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Being physically inactive—not getting enough exercise
Age (if you are a male 45 years or older or a female 50-55 years or older)
Hypertension (blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or taking high blood pressure medications)
Family history of premature heart disease (heart disease in a first-degree male relative under age 55 or a first-degree female relative under age 65)
Pre-existing heart disease or already having had a heart attack
Diabetes or prediabetes

Children, teens, and young adults (ages 2 to 24 years old) with no risk factors should have a lipid panel once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between 17 and 21, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).
Children, teens, and young adults with an increased risk of developing heart disease as adults should have earlier and more frequent screening with lipid panels. Some of the risk factors are similar to those in adults and include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight. High-risk children should be tested between 2 and 8 years old with a fasting lipid panel, according to the AAP.
Children younger than 2 years old are too young to be tested.
For additional details on this, see the screening articles for Children, Teens, Young Adults, Adults, and Adults 50 and Up.
Monitoring
A lipid panel may be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or to determine the effectiveness of medication such as statins.



",,"



There is increasing interest in measuring triglycerides in people who have not fasted. The reason is that a non-fasting sample may be more representative of the ""usual"" circulating level of triglyceride since most of the day, blood lipid levels reflect post-meal (post-prandial) levels rather than fasting levels. However, it is not yet certain how to interpret non-fasting levels for evaluating risk, so at present there is no change in the current recommendations for fasting prior to tests for lipid levels.
A routine cardiac risk assessment typically includes a fasting lipid panel. Beyond that, research continues into the usefulness of other non-traditional markers of cardiac risk, such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lipoprotein A (Lp(a)), Lp-PLA2, LDL particle testing (LDL-P), apolipoprotein A-1 and apolipoprotein B. A healthcare practitioner may choose to evaluate one or more of these markers to help determine someone's risk, but there is no consensus on their use and they are not widely available. For a more detailed discussion on these, see the article on Cardiac Risk Assessment.



","



The lipid panel is used as part of a cardiac risk assessment to help determine your risk of heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be best if you have borderline risk, intermediate risk, or high risk. Initial screening may involve only a single test for total cholesterol and not a full lipid panel. However, if the screening cholesterol test result is high, it will likely be followed by testing with a lipid panel.
The results of the lipid panel are considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up. Depending on the results and other risk factors, treatment options may involve lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise or medications that lower lipid levels, typically statins.
Additionally, a lipid panel may be used to monitor whether treatment has been effective in lowering cholesterol levels.

lipoprotein-a,"['Lipoprotein little a', 'Lp(a)']","

To give your healthcare practitioner additional information about your risk of developing heart disease; as part of a cardiac risk assessment


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Lipoprotein (a) or Lp(a) is one type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol in the blood. It consists of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) molecule with another protein (Apolipoprotein (a)) attached to it. This test measures the Lp(a) level in the blood to help evaluate your risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Like LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol), Lp(a) is considered a risk factor for CVD. However, Lp(a) does not respond to typical strategies to lower LDL cholesterol such as diet, exercise, or most lipid-lowering medications, such as statins. The amount of Lp(a) that you have is determined by the genes you inherited, and it remains relatively constant over your lifetime. A high level of Lp(a) is thought to contribute to your overall risk of CVD, making this test potentially useful as a cardiovascular risk marker.
The protein portion of Lp(a) consists of:

Apolipoprotein B (Apo B) – a protein that is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of lipids and is the main protein constituent of lipoproteins such as LDL and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)
Apolipoprotein (a) – a second protein component, which is attached to the Apo B. Apolipoprotein (a) has an unusual structure and is thought to inhibit clots from being broken down normally. The size of the apolipoprotein(a) portion of Lp(a) varies in size from person to person and tends to be smaller in Caucasians than in those of African ancestry. The significance of the variation in size in contributing to CVD risk is complex, but there is some evidence that smaller size increases risk. Most Lp(a) tests do not measure the size of apolipoprotein (a) because they measure and report only the level of Lp(a) in blood.

Since about 50% of the people who have heart attacks have a normal cholesterol level, researchers have sought other factors that may have an influence on heart disease. It is thought that Lp(a) may be one such factor. Lp(a) has two potential ways to contribute to heart risk: 

Lp(a) can promote deposits of LDL cholesterol in blood vessel walls and the formation of plaque on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke.
Apo(a) has a structure that can inhibit enzymes that dissolve clots, so Lp(a) may promote the formation of clots in the arteries.

For these reasons, Lp(a) may be more of a risk factor for atherosclerosis than LDL cholesterol.

Some healthcare practitioners may also order these tests when:

You have existing heart or vascular disease, especially when you have healthy lipid levels or ones that are only mildly elevated
You may have an inherited predisposition for a high cholesterol level

","



A high Lp(a) level may increase your risk for heart disease and stroke. High Lp(a) can occur in people with a normal lipid panel. An elevated level of Lp(a) is thought to contribute to risk of heart disease independent of other lipids.
The level of Lp(a) is determined by your genes and is not easily modified by lifestyle changes or medication, such as statins. However, some non-genetic conditions may also lead to elevated Lp(a). These include low estrogen levels, severe underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), uncontrolled diabetes, chronic kidney disease and nephrotic syndrome.
There are no known problems associated with low Lp(a). Many individuals have no detectable Lp(a) in their blood.

In rare cases, an Lp(a) level may be ordered when a woman has entered menopause to see if elevations in Lp(a), tied to decreasing estrogen levels, have significantly increased her risk of developing CVD.

Researchers have known for some time that tumors shed cells and DNA or RNA into body fluids, including blood. In recent years, scientists have been able to gain information about tumors by analyzing these cells or DNA or RNA that circulate in the blood. These techniques require blood samples rather than the tumor tissue samples required by traditional biopsies, so they are often called liquid biopsies.
Tissue biopsies are the standard of care for cancer diagnosis. However, removing cancer tissue through surgery, or in some cases a needle biopsy, is an invasive process. In addition, the difficulty reaching a tumor can limit the ability of healthcare practitioners to sample it. However, the genetic information in tumor cells and tumor DNA or RNA may provide important information about the tumor, such as the likelihood of response to treatment, of relapse after treatment, or how the tumor is responding to cancer therapy. This has led to the emergence of liquid biopsy as a promising, non-invasive, complement to tissue biopsy.
By requiring a blood draw rather than a tissue biopsy, liquid biopsies can be more tolerable than traditional biopsies and may be acceptable for more frequent sampling to monitor cancer. As cancer treatments become more targeted to the genetic makeup of a tumor, liquid biopsies are a minimally-invasive way to understand how a tumor's genetic make-up is evolving during treatment.
Currently, there are two main approaches to liquid biopsy:

Circulating tumor cell (CTC) tests, which look at whole tumor cells in the blood
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests, which look for the DNA that tumor cells release into the blood

Other techniques, such as looking at cell fragments called extracellular vesicles (exosomes) or small molecules of non-coding RNA (microRNAs), are being studied.
In addition to applications such as cancer detection and treatment, liquid biopsies may also provide promise for cancer diagnosis, monitoring, and early detection. Currently, the medical applications of liquid biopsies are limited to determining prognosis in breast, colon, and prostate cancer, guiding treatment in those cancers, and guiding treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.

",,"



Testing may be ordered:

When you have metastatic breast, colon, or prostate cancer and a better understanding of the prognosis (predicted course of disease) is necessary to guide treatment
When monitoring response to treatment for metastatic breast, colon, or prostate cancer
Before or after starting certain specific targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer




","




Circulating tumor cell count (CTC)—circulating tumor cell counts are measured as the number of CTCs in a specified volume of blood. Results may be interpreted as favorable or unfavorable. Prostate, colon, and breast cancers all have unique cutoffs for when a CTC count is no longer favorable for prognosis.
	Studies show that lower CTC counts or levels are associated with a more favorable prognosis, specifically how long individuals live after treatment (overall survival) and the time between diagnosis and progression of the disease to a higher stage or recurrence of the tumor (progression-free survival). If the CTC count is above a certain cutoff during the course of cancer, it is associated with a poor prognosis and is predictive of shorter progression-free survival and overall survival. If it is below that cutoff it is associated with more favorable prognosis.

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) tests—these tests can detect mutations in the tumor that can predict potential responsiveness or resistance to certain therapies. For example:
	
In a person with lung cancer, a positive ctDNA test for a sensitizing EGFR mutation (i.e., a mutation that makes the cancer sensitive to targeted therapy) means the cancer is likely to respond to targeted therapy and the individual can receive these treatments. However, ctDNA testing is known to sometimes give false-negative results (meaning the mutation is present but not detected by the ctDNA testing). For this reason, the FDA recommends a tissue biopsy if the liquid biopsy is negative (doesn't detect a sensitizing mutation).
In addition, when a patient has already been treated with an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor but does not appear to be responding favorably to the treatment, a liquid biopsy may be used to detect an EGFR T790M mutation, which causes resistance to targeted therapy. If an EGFR T790M mutation is detected, it can then be targeted with a different drug that has been designed especially for this particular mutation. However, data are currently limited on this use for a liquid biopsy, so it may be used only if a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained.






",,"



Liquid biopsies may be used to help guide treatment, predict treatment response or prognosis, and monitor therapy and disease progression in select cancers.
There are currently two main types of clinically available liquid biopsy:

Circulating tumor cell count (CTC)—these tests look at whole tumor cells in the blood to help determine prognosis in breast, colon, or prostate cancer that has spread to nearby or distant organs (metastatic). They may also be used to evaluate responses to therapy for those cancers.
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)—these tests look for tumor DNA that cancer cells release into the blood. An example is an FDA-approved test that is used to decide if anti-EGFR medications (erlotinib or osimertinib) can be used to treat non-small-cell lung cancer.

Lithium is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antipsychotic for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Occasionally, it can be used in other disorders in combination with an antidepressant that does not adequately treat a depression. This test measures the amount of lithium in the blood.
Bipolar disorder can affect both adults and children. It is a mental condition marked by alternating periods of depression and mania. These periods may be as short as a few days or weeks or as long as months or years.

During an episode of depression, you may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and lose interest in daily activities. You may be fatigued but have trouble sleeping, experience weight loss or gain, have difficulty concentrating, and have thoughts of suicide.
During a manic episode, you may be euphoric, irritable, have high energy and grandiose ideas, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Sometimes you will have mixed episodes with aspects of both mania and depression.

Lithium is prescribed to stabilize the mood swings of bipolar disorder. It is often called a ""mood stabilizer"" and is sometimes prescribed for people with depression who are not responding well to other medications. Less commonly, lithium may be prescribed to prevent disorders with symptoms of schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations, delusions) and cluster headaches.
Because lithium is a relatively slow-acting drug, its effect on mood may take several weeks. Dosages of the drug are adjusted up or down until blood levels are within a therapeutic range—the blood level range that achieves the desired effect and treats your bipolar disorder. The actual amount of drug that it will take to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may be affected by your age, general state of health, and other medications that you are taking.
Lithium levels are monitored on a regular basis because lithium has a narrow therapeutic index. This means there is relatively little space between therapeutic and toxic levels. Too little drug, and the medication will not be effective. Too much drug and symptoms of lithium toxicity may develop.

Lithium testing is ordered frequently when you first start lithium treatment. After you have achieved stable blood levels in the therapeutic range, your healthcare practitioner may order lithium tests at regular intervals to ensure that drug levels remain in this range.
The test may be ordered when your condition does not appear to be responding to lithium to determine whether levels are too low, the medication is not working, and/or to determine if you are complying with therapy (taking the lithium regularly). It may also be ordered when you experience a troublesome level of side effects and/or exhibits symptoms that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to toxicity, such as:

Symptoms of an allergic reaction to lithium, such as hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat
Drowsiness, lack of energy
Dizziness
Muscle weakness
Lack of coordination
Slurred speech
Gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea
Confusion
Irregular tremors or shaking
Restlessness
Apathy
Urinating frequently
Feeling very thirsty
Fever

Extremely high levels can lead to stupor, seizures, kidney failure, and death.
Blood samples for lithium levels are generally drawn 12 hours after the last dose. Since dosage timing varies and some formulations are time-released, collection specifics may vary.



","



The therapeutic range for lithium has been established at 0.6 - 1.2 mmol/L. Within this range, most people will respond to the drug without symptoms of toxicity.
Response and side effects vary among individuals. For some people with bipolar disorder, their condition will not be adequately treated at the low end of the therapeutic range. Others may experience excessive side effects at the upper end of the therapeutic range. You should work closely with your healthcare practitioner to find the dose that works best for you.
In general, when lithium results are in the therapeutic range and both your and your healthcare practitioner are satisfied that your bipolar disorder is being appropriately managed, then the dosage of lithium is adequate, particularly if you are not experiencing significant side effects.
If the blood level is below the therapeutic range, it is likely that you are not receiving adequate medication. If levels are above the therapeutic range and if there are significant side effects present at the current dose, then it is likely that the dose is too high. In these cases, your healthcare practitioner may adjust the lithium dose. However, you should not decrease or stop taking your medication without consulting with your healthcare practitioner as it can worsen your bipolar symptoms. Dose determinations and adjustments must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.



","



A variety of prescribed drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements can increase, decrease, or interfere with the concentrations of lithium in the blood. For more information, see MedlinePlus Drug Information: Lithium.
Lithium levels and side effects can increase with the loss of salt and water from the body, such as may occur with a salt-free diet, excessive sweating, or with an illness that causes vomiting and diarrhea. To keep blood levels of lithium stable, the National Institutes of Health recommends drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water or other liquids each day, keeping salt and caffeine intake the same as before starting the drug, and avoiding alcohol.



","



The lithium test is used to measure and monitor the amount of lithium in your blood so that a healthcare practitioner can determine whether the drug blood level is within the range that will adequately treat your bipolar disorder (therapeutic range). The test may be used to measure blood levels every few days when you first begin taking lithium to help adjust the dose and reach the desired blood level and may also be used at regular intervals or as needed to monitor blood levels. If you start taking additional medications, your healthcare practitioner may order one or more lithium tests to judge the other drugs' effect, if any, on lithium levels. Lithium tests may also be ordered if toxicity is suspected.

It takes up most of the space under the ribs and some space in the left upper abdomen as well.
The liver is responsible for several essential body functions, such as:

Filtering and breaking down harmful substances from the blood to be removed from the body in urine and stools
Making bile that helps digest food, especially fat
Storing glycogen, which is used for energy
Converting nutrients from the food we eat into essential blood components
Regulating blood clotting
Maintaining hormone balances
Storing some vitamins
Making factors that help the immune system fight infection
Removing bacteria from the blood

In addition, liver cells convert ammonia (end product of amino acids) to a less harmful substance called urea, which the body can get rid of through the urine.
A variety of diseases and infections can cause acute or chronic damage to the liver, causing inflammation (hepatitis), scarring (cirrhosis), bile duct obstructions, liver tumors, and liver dysfunction. Alcohol, drugs, some herbal supplements, and toxins can also inure the liver. A significant amount of liver damage may occur before symptoms such as jaundice, dark urine, light-colored stools, itching (pruritus), nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and unexplained weight loss or gain appear. Early detection of liver injury is essential in order to minimize damage and preserve liver function.
The liver panel typically consists of several tests that measure the following:
Liver enzymes:

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) – an enzyme mainly found in the liver; the best test for detecting hepatitis
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) – an enzyme related to the bile ducts but also produced by the bones, intestines, and during pregnancy by the placenta (afterbirth); often increased when bile ducts are blocked or damaged
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) – an enzyme found in the liver and a few other organs, particularly the heart and other muscles in the body

Proteins:

Albumin – measures the main protein made by the liver; the level can be affected by liver and kidney function and by decreased production or increased loss.
Total protein (TP) – measures albumin and all other proteins in blood, including antibodies made to help fight off infections
Bilirubin – two different tests of bilirubin often used together (especially if a person has jaundice): total bilirubin measures all the bilirubin in the blood; direct bilirubin measures a form that is conjugated (combined with another compound) in the liver.

Depending on your healthcare provider and the laboratory performing the testing, additional tests may be included in a liver panel. Examples include:

Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) – another enzyme found mainly in liver cells; it is a very sensitive marker for liver diseases, but it is not specific as it cannot differentiate between various causes of liver diseases. GGT is not recommended for routine use. It is used in conjunction with ALP to determine the source of increased ALP, either from bone or liver. High level of GGT can be found with alcohol consumption.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) – an enzyme released with cell damage; found in cells throughout the body
Prothrombin time (PT) – the liver produces proteins involved in the clotting (coagulation) of blood; the PT measures clotting function and, if abnormal, may indicate liver damage.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) – associated with regeneration or proliferation of liver cell and can be produced by certain types of tumors
Autoimmune antibodies (e.g., ANA, SMA, anti-LKM-1) – associated with autoimmune liver diseases (autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC))

Periodically to evaluate liver function; whenever you are at risk for liver injury; when you are taking medications that may affect your liver; when you have a liver disease; when you have symptoms associated with liver damage, such as jaundice


","



A liver panel, or one or more of its components, may be ordered when you have increased risk for liver disease and/or dysfunction. You may be at increased risk if you:

Take medications that may potentially damage the liver
Are an alcoholic or heavy drinker
Have a viral hepatitis or possible exposure to hepatitis viruses
Have a family history of liver disease
Are overweight, especially if you have diabetes and/or high blood pressure

A liver panel may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of liver disease. However, most people who have liver disease do not have any of these symptoms until the disease has been present for many years or is very severe. Signs and symptoms may include:

Weakness, fatigue
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Abdominal swelling and/or pain
Jaundice (yellowing of eyes or skin)
Dark urine, light-colored stool
Itching (pruritus)
Diarrhea

Often, a series of liver panels are ordered over a few days or weeks to help determine the cause of the liver disorder and evaluate its severity.
When liver disease is detected, it may be monitored on a regular basis over time with the liver panel or with one or more of its components. A liver panel may also be ordered regularly to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for the liver disorder.



","



Liver panel test results are not diagnostic of a specific condition. They indicate that there may be a problem with the liver. If you have no symptoms or identifiable risk factors, abnormal liver test results may indicate a temporary liver injury or reflect something that is happening elsewhere in the body – such as in the skeletal muscles, pancreas, or heart. It may also indicate early liver disease and the need for further testing and/or periodic monitoring.
Results of liver panels are usually evaluated together. Several sets of results from tests performed over a few days or weeks are often assessed together to determine if there is a pattern. Your healthcare practitioner will evaluate the combination of liver test results to gain clues about the underlying condition. Often, further testing is necessary to determine the cause of the liver damage and/or disease.
The following table summarizes some combinations of results that may be seen in certain types of liver conditions or diseases.

If you take medications that may affect your liver, then abnormal test results may indicate a need to reevaluate the dose or choice of medication. When your liver disease is being monitored over time, then your healthcare practitioner will evaluate the results of the liver panel together to determine if liver function or damage is worsening or improving. For example, increasingly abnormal bilirubin, albumin, and/or PT may indicate a deterioration in liver function, while stable or improving results of these tests may indicate that liver function is stable or improving.
For individual tests:
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
A very high level of ALT is frequently seen with acute hepatitis. Moderate increases may be seen with chronic hepatitis. People with blocked bile ducts, cirrhosis, and liver cancer may have ALT concentrations that are only moderately elevated or close to normal.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
ALP may be significantly increased with obstructed bile ducts, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and also with bone disease.
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
A very high level of AST is frequently seen with acute hepatitis. AST may be normal to moderately increased with chronic hepatitis. In people with blocked bile ducts, cirrhosis, and liver cancer, AST concentrations may be moderately increased or close to normal. When liver damage is due to alcohol, AST often increases much more than ALT (this is a pattern seen with few other liver diseases). AST is also increased after heart attacks and with muscle injury.
Bilirubin
Bilirubin is increased in the blood when too much is being produced, less is being removed, due to bile duct obstructions, or to problems with bilirubin processing. It is not uncommon to see high bilirubin levels in newborns, typically 1 to 3 days old.
Albumin
Albumin is often normal in liver disease but may be low due to decreased production, especially in liver cirrhosis.
Total protein (TP)
Total protein is typically normal with liver disease.
Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)
A GGT test may be used to help determine the cause of an elevated ALP. Both ALP and GGT are elevated in bile duct and liver disease, but only ALP will be elevated in bone disease. Increased GGT levels are also seen with alcohol consumption and with conditions, such as congestive heart failure.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LD)
This is a non-specific marker of tissue damage. It is usually not elevated with most liver diseases, but it may be elevated with very acute liver disease or liver tumors. It is also elevated with a number of other conditions that do not affect the liver.
Prothrombin time (PT)
A prolonged or increased PT can be seen with liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, use of drugs to reduce risk of clotting (warfarin), and with coagulation factor deficiencies.

A liver panel may be used to:

Screen for liver damage, especially if you have a condition or are taking medication that may affect your liver; a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which is often performed as part of a general health checkup, may be ordered instead of a liver panel for routine screening. This group of tests includes most of the liver panel as well as additional tests that evaluate other organs and systems within the body.
Help diagnose liver disease if you have signs and symptoms that indicate possible liver dysfunction
Monitor liver function if you have liver disease or a condition known to affect the liver, or to monitor the effectiveness of any treatments

One or more components of the liver panel may be used for monitoring. A series of bilirubin tests, for instance, may be ordered to evaluate and monitor a jaundiced newborn or a person with hemolytic anemia.
Abnormal results on a liver panel may prompt repeat testing of one or more of the tests, or of the whole panel, to see if the abnormal results persist. Additional testing may be needed to determine the cause of the liver dysfunction.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is an enzyme that appears to play a role in the inflammation of blood vessels and is thought to help promote atherosclerosis. This test measures the amount or activity of Lp-PLA2 in the blood.
Some recent studies have shown that Lp-PLA2 is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease (CHD), and ischemic stroke. In these studies, increased concentrations of Lp-PLA2 were seen in many people who were diagnosed with CHD and ischemic stroke, regardless of other risk factors. These findings make this relatively new test potentially useful as one of a growing number of cardiac risk markers that are used to help determine a person's risk of developing CVD.
CVD causes more deaths in the U.S. each year than any other cause, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CHD and ischemic stroke are both associated with the buildup of fatty plaque deposits in the arteries that can lead to blockages in blood vessels and to heart attacks or brain damage. There are a variety of risk factors that have been identified as being associated with both conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, smoking, obesity, high cholesterol levels, increased LDL (low-density lipoprotein, the ""bad cholesterol""), and decreased HDL (high-density lipoprotein, the ""good cholesterol"").
Many people who have one or more of the commonly recognized risk factors will eventually develop CVD, but a significant number of people who have few or none of these risk factors will also develop CVD. This has lead researchers to look for additional markers that might identify those at increased risk of CVD.
In addition to the traditional risk factors listed above, a low level of chronic, systemic inflammation and blood vessel (vascular) inflammation are thought to contribute to overall risk for developing CVD. The hs-CRP test is associated with systemic inflammation; high levels are associated with increased CVD risk. The Lp-PLA2 test is associated with vascular inflammation, and high levels are thought to increase the chance of cardiovascular events, including heart attack or stroke. High levels of Lp-PLA2 is also associated with vascular complications in people with diabetes, such as kidney disease.

Lp-PLA2 is a relatively new test that is not frequently ordered.

A significantly elevated Lp-PLA2 level indicates an increased risk for developing CHD or of having an ischemic stroke and provide a healthcare practitioner with additional information about the tested person's overall risk.
A low or normal Lp-PLA2 means that this factor does not contribute to the tested person's risk of CVD.
The test is not diagnostic of CHD or ischemic stroke; it is a risk indicator. Many people with increased concentrations will not develop these conditions, and some with normal levels will.



","



While the findings from recent studies support the potential usefulness of Lp-PLA2 in CHD  and ischemic stroke risk assessment, its ultimate clinical utility has yet to be established.
The Lp-PLA2 test is not widely available. In most cases, the blood sample will be sent to a reference laboratory and results will be available within a few days.

The Lp-PLA2 test is sometimes used to help evaluate a person's risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) or to help determine the risk of having an ischemic stroke.
Lp-PLA2 is an enzyme that appears to play a role in the inflammation of blood vessels and is thought to help promote atherosclerosis. Some recent studies have shown that Lp-PLA2 is an independent risk marker for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including CHD and ischemic stroke.
The test would typically be used to evaluate an individual who is at a moderate to elevated risk for CHD or stroke, someone with one or more other risk factors. For instance, it may be ordered when someone has normal or minimally elevated lipid levels, borderline high blood pressure (hypertension), or metabolic syndrome.
An Lp-PLA2 test may sometimes be used along with an hs-CRP test to evaluate a person's level of underlying inflammation associated with CVD risk. However, unlike hs-CRP, the Lp-PLA2 test is not affected by conditions other than CVD that can cause general inflammation, so it may be used when someone has an inflammatory condition, such as arthritis.
Lp-PLA2 is a relatively new test that is not frequently ordered and its full clinical usefulness has yet to be established. It is intended to give additional information, not to replace cholesterol and other lipid level testing.
Some researchers are exploring whether treatment to lower Lp-PLA2 levels will lower a person's risk of CHD and ischemic stroke. However, several studies on drugs that inhibit Lp-PLA2 activity (such as darapladib) found that inhibition had little or no effect on reducing risk of CHD. If future studies found the risk of CVD and stroke is decreased when Lp-PLA2 is lowered, then the Lp-PLA2 test may be ordered more frequently and be used to monitor a person's response to treatment.

","

To help investigate the cause of a blood clot (thrombotic episode); to evaluate a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT); to help determine the cause of recurrent miscarriages, or as part of an evaluation for antiphospholipid syndrome; the tests are not used to diagnose the chronic autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), commonly known as lupus.


","

A blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm


","



Lupus anticoagulants (LA) are autoantibodies produced by the immune system that mistakenly attack certain components of the body's own cells. They specifically target phospholipids as well as the proteins associated with phospholipids that are found in the outer-most layer of cells (cell membranes). These autoantibodies interfere with the blood clotting process in a way that is not fully understood and increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot. Lupus anticoagulant testing is a series of tests that detect the presence of LA in the blood.
The lupus anticoagulant test's name may seem odd or confusing for two reasons:

Lupus anticoagulants were so-named because they were first found among patients with lupus, but LA testing is not used to diagnose the autoimmune disorder and LA are frequently absent in people with lupus. LA may also occur in individuals with other conditions and in people who take certain medications. The antibodies are present in about 2-4% of the general population and may develop in people with no known risk factors.
The term ""anticoagulant"" is part of the name because LA actually prolong clotting time in laboratory tests that are used to evaluate coagulation. For example, they inhibit the chemical reactions that lead to clotting in the partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a test routinely used to evaluate clotting. However, the presence of LA in the human body is associated with an increased risk of developing inappropriate blood clots. Importantly, lupus anticoagulant itself does not cause bleeding in the body.

There is no single test for the detection of lupus anticoagulant and it cannot be measured directly. The presence of LA is usually determined by using a panel of sequential tests for which there is no standardization.

Initial testing typically involves one or more tests that depend on phospholipid-containing reagents, usually PTT, the LA-sensitive PTT (known as PTT-LA) or dilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT). All of these tests measure the time it takes (in seconds) for a plasma sample to clot; LA prolongs that time.
Depending on the results of these initial tests, certain follow-up tests are performed to either confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant. For more on this, see the section below titled ""How is it used?"".

LA may increase the risk of developing blood clots in both the veins and arteries, often in the veins in the legs (knowns as deep vein thrombosis or DVT). These clots may block blood flow in any part of the body, leading to stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary embolism. LA is also associated with recurrent miscarriages. It has been suggested that LA causes clots to form that block blood vessels of the placenta, affecting growth of the developing baby, and that LA may also directly attack the tissue of the placenta, affecting its development.
The lupus anticoagulant is one of three primary antiphospholipid antibodies that are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by excess blood clot formation, organ failures, and pregnancy complications. The other two are cardiolipin antibodies and beta-2 glycoprotein 1 antibody. Individually and together, they increase a person's tendency to clot inappropriately. People with APS are at greater risk for clotting if they test positive for all three antibodies. However, thrombosis appears more common in people with LA.
Not everyone with antiphospholipid antibodies will develop symptoms. Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in about 5% of healthy individuals.

When you have had signs and symptoms of a blood clot in a vein or artery (known as thrombosis or thromboembolism); when you have a prolonged PTT test of unknown cause; when you have had recurrent miscarriages


","



Lupus anticoagulant testing is ordered along with other tests when:

Someone has had an unexplained blood clot in a vein or artery; signs and symptoms can range from pain, swelling, and discoloration in the leg in the case of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to fatigue, sweating, and rapid breathing with a pulmonary embolism (PE).
An individual has signs and symptoms of APS; these may be similar to the ones mentioned above.
A woman experiences recurrent miscarriages
A person has a prolonged PTT test that is unexplained

If results indicate the presence of lupus anticoagulant (LA), testing is usually repeated about 12 weeks later to confirm that it is still present, especially for individuals being tested for APS.
When a person is initially negative for lupus anticoagulant but has an autoimmune disease such as lupus, a healthcare practitioner may occasionally repeat one or more of the lupus anticoagulant screening tests, usually the PTT, to determine whether the antibody has developed since the last time the test was performed. This is done because the person has the potential to develop the lupus anticoagulant at any time.



","



The results of the series of LA tests either lead toward or away from the likelihood of having LA. The laboratory report may be somewhat complicated, but it usually provides an interpretation of the results and states whether LA is present or absent. LA testing results, like those of other tests for clotting disorders, are difficult to interpret and are best evaluated by laboratory technologists and/or physicians with experience with excessive clotting disorders testing.
Although the initial tests performed for LA may vary, they usually begin with a PTT that is prolonged. A PTT that is normal (not prolonged) may mean that there is no LA present. However, the test may not be sensitive enough to detect LA and the LA-sensitive PTT (PTT-LA) may need to be done.
(See below for additional details on LA testing results.)
Results that indicate the presence of LA may mean that a person's signs and symptoms are due, at least in part, to LA. Results that indicate that LA is NOT present may mean that signs and symptoms, such as a prolonged PTT, are due to some other cause such as deficiency on coagulation factor(s).
For example, if LA is positive on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart, the results may indicate antiphospholipid syndrome. Lupus anticoagulant testing is often done in conjunction with tests for cardiolipin antibody and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies to help diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome. The results are interpreted together, along with clinical criteria, in order to make a diagnosis.
Some other tests may be done to help confirm the diagnosis of a lupus anticoagulant and/or to help rule out other causes of a prolonged PTT. Examples include:

Coagulation factor assays (e.g., fibrinogen) – these may be ordered to rule out factor deficiencies that may cause a prolonged PTT and bleeding episodes; a panel of factor assays may also help in detecting lupus anticoagulant versus factor deficiency.
Complete blood count (CBC) – the CBC test includes a platelet count; mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is often seen along with the lupus anticoagulant; moderate to severe thrombocytopenia may develop in patients receiving anticoagulant (heparin) therapy for lupus anticoagulant-associated thrombosis.
Thrombin time – if a thrombin time test is normal, then heparin contamination is excluded as a cause of prolonged PTT.




","



After heparin contamination, a lupus anticoagulant is the most common reason for a prolonged PTT.
Occasionally, LA testing may be ordered to help determine the cause of a positive VDRL/RPR test for syphilis because cardiolipin antibodies may produce a false-positive result with these syphilis tests.
Lupus anticoagulants may also be present in individuals with autoimmune diseases, infections such as HIV/AIDS, inflammation, cancers, and in people who take certain medications, such as phenothiazines, penicillin, quinidine, hydralazine, procainamide, and fansidar.
Patients on heparin or heparin substitute (such as hirudin, danaparoid, or argatroban) anticoagulation therapy may have false-positive results for lupus anticoagulant. Warfarin (COUMADIN®) anticoagulant therapy may also cause false test results if levels of coagulation factor II, VII, IX and X are significantly decreased. If possible, lupus anticoagulant testing should be done prior to the start of anticoagulation therapy.
If someone with a harmful blood clot (thrombosis) has a lupus anticoagulant, it is usually necessary to prolong and possibly increase the intensity of the person's anticoagulation therapy.
For someone with a confirmed lupus anticoagulant, the usual anticoagulation monitoring test (e.g., PTT for heparin, PT/INR for warfarin) is unreliable, so alternative testing should be used for therapy monitoring. For example, chromogenic anti-Xa and chromogenic Xa assays should be used for heparin and warfarin monitoring, respectively.



",,"



Lupus anticoagulant testing is a series of tests used to detect lupus anticoagulant (LA) in the blood. LA is an autoantibody associated with excess blood clot formation. LA testing may be used to help determine the cause of:

An unexplained blood clot (thrombosis) in a vein or artery
Recurrent miscarriages in a woman
An unexplained prolonged  partial thromboplastin time (PTT, aPTT test); PTT measures the time it takes in seconds for a person's blood sample to clot in a test tube after reagents are added. LA testing helps determine whether a prolonged PTT is due to a specific inhibitor, such as an antibody against a specific coagulation factor, or to a nonspecific inhibitor like the lupus anticoagulant, or is due to deficiency in coagulation factor(s).

LA testing may also be used:

Along with tests for cardiolipin antibody and anti-beta2-glycoprotein I to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
Along with tests such as factor V Leiden, antithrombin, or proteins C and S to help diagnose an excessive clotting disorder (thrombophilia)
To determine whether the lupus anticoagulant is temporary (transient) or persistent

LA cannot be measured directly and there is no single test or standardized procedure to detect the presence of LA in the blood. A series of tests is used to confirm or rule out the autoantibody:

It is recommended that two tests be used to detect lupus anticoagulant initially (known as LA-Screen). The most sensitive tests are dilute Russell viper venom test (DRVVT) and a LA-sensitive PTT (PTT-LA), one that uses reagents containing low levels of phospholipid. Follow-up testing is performed to confirm or exclude the presence of lupus anticoagulant. These may include:
Mixing study: an equal volume of patient plasma is mixed with ""normal"" pooled plasma and a PTT or DRVVT is performed on this mixture.
Correction/neutralization (known as LA-Confirm): an excess of phospholipids is added to the patient sample and a PTT-LA or DRVVT is performed. (When PTT-LA is measured, the assay is called a hexagonal phase phospholipid neutralization assay). The results are then compared to that of the LA-Screen, and an interpretation is made by a laboratory technologist or pathologist.

luteinizing-hormone-lh,"['LH', 'Lutropin', 'Interstitial Cell Stimulating Hormone', 'ICSH']","

No test preparation is needed, but a woman's sample should be collected at specific times during her menstrual cycle.


","

To evaluate fertility issues or the health of your reproductive organs (ovaries or testicles); for women, to determine whether you have ovulated (released an egg from the ovary); to evaluate pituitary function
In children, to evaluate early or delayed puberty


","

A blood sample is drawn by needle from a vein.


","



Luteinizing hormone (LH) is a hormone associated with reproduction. Its stimulation of either ovary or testicles results in the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation) in women or testosterone production in men. This test measures the amount of luteinizing hormone in the blood.
LH is produced by the pituitary gland, a small organ located in the center of the head behind the sinus cavity at the base of the brain. Control of LH production is a complex system involving the hypothalamus in the brain, the pituitary gland, and the hormones produced by the ovaries and testicles.
In women of childbearing age, several hormones (LH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen and progesterone) rise and fall in a specific sequence during each menstrual cycle. Womens' menstrual cycles are divided into follicular and luteal phases, with each phase lasting about 14 days. Near the end of the follicular phase, there is a mid-cycle surge of FSH and LH. This surge triggers ovulation, causing the rupture of the egg follicle on the ovary and the release of the egg.
During the luteal phase, the site where the egg follicle ruptured becomes a ""corpus luteum."" LH release stimulates the corpus luteum to start producing progesterone. FSH and LH levels decline, while progesterone and estradiol concentrations increase. These hormone levels decrease in turn after several days if the egg is not fertilized. Menstruation starts and when it ends, the cycle begins again.
As a woman ages and menopause approaches, ovarian function wanes and eventually ceases. As this occurs, FSH and LH levels rise.
In men, LH stimulates Leydig cells in the testicles to produce testosterone. LH levels are relatively constant in men after puberty. A high testosterone level provides negative feedback to the pituitary gland and the hypothalamus, thus decreasing the amount of LH released.
In infants and children, LH levels rise shortly after birth and then fall to very low levels (by 6 months in boys and 1-2 years in girls). At about 6-8 years, levels again rise before the beginning of puberty and the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

Breast enlargement in girls
Growth of pubic hair
Growth of testicles and penis in boys

","



Results of an LH test are typically considered with results of other hormone tests, such as FSH, estrogens, and/or testosterone.
In Women 
LH and FSH levels can help to differentiate between conditions affecting the ovaries themselves (primary) and dysfunction of the ovaries due to disorders of either the pituitary or the hypothalamus (secondary).
Increased levels of LH and FSH are seen in the following:
Developmental defects:

Failure to develop ovaries (ovarian agenesis)
Chromosome disorder, such as Turner syndrome
Defect in steroid production by the ovaries, such as 17 alpha hydroxylase deficiency

Damage or injury to the ovaries due to:

Exposure to radiation
Chemotherapy
Autoimmune disease

Underlying conditions that affect ovary function, such as:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Adrenal disease
Thyroid disease

In women who are trying to become pregnant, multiple LH tests can be used to detect the surge that precedes ovulation. An LH surge indicates that ovulation has occurred.
During menopause, a woman's ovaries cease to function; thus LH levels will rise.
Low levels of LH and FSH may be seen in problems with the pituitary or hypothalamus. See the article on Pituitary Disorders for more information.
In Men 
High LH levels may indicate a condition affecting the testicles themselves. Some examples include:

Viral infection (mumps)
Trauma, injury
Exposure to radiation
Chemotherapy
Autoimmune disease
Germ cell tumor
Failure to develop normal gonads (gonadal agenesis or gonadal dysgenesis)
Chromosome disorder, such as Klinefelter syndrome

Low levels of LH and FSH may indicate a problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus. See the article on Pituitary Disorders for more information.
In Both Men and Women 
LH response to GnRH can help differentiate between a pituitary disorder and a problem involving the hypothalamus. Once the baseline level of LH has been measured, a dose of GnRH is given by injection. A subsequent increase in the level of LH indicates that the pituitary responded to the GnRH and points to a disorder involving the hypothalamus. A reduced level of LH shows that the pituitary did not respond to the GnRH and suggests a disease involving the pituitary.
In Children 
In young children, higher levels of LH and FSH than expected for age when paired with the development of secondary sexual characteristics at an unusually young age are an indication of early puberty. This is much more common in girls than in boys. This premature development is usually due to a problem with the central nervous system and can have a few different underlying causes. Examples include:

Central nervous system tumor
Brain injury, trauma
Inflammation within the central nervous system (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis)

Normal prepubescent levels of LH and FSH in children exhibiting signs of puberty (e.g., development of pubic hair and acne) may indicate a condition brought on by elevated levels of the hormones estrogen or testosterone. This may be caused by:

Exposure to estrogen or testosterone creams or gels
Premature adrenarche (an early awakening of the adrenal glands)
Tumors that produce hormones
Adrenal gland tumors
Ovarian tumors or cysts
Testicular tumors

Normal FSH and LH levels with a few signs of puberty may be a normal variation of puberty.
In delayed puberty, LH and FSH levels can be high, normal, or below what is expected for a youth within this age range. The test for LH response to GnRH in addition to other testing may help to diagnose the reason for the delayed puberty. Some of the causes for delayed puberty can include:

Failure of the ovaries or testicles
Hormone deficiency
Turner syndrome 
Klinefelter syndrome
Chronic infections
Cancer
Eating disorder (anorexia nervosa)




","



Some drugs can cause LH to increase, such as anticonvulsants, clomiphene, naloxone, and ketoconazole, while others cause LH to decrease, such as digoxin, oral contraceptives, and hormone treatments.

In both women and men, the LH test is often used in conjunction with other tests (FSH, testosterone, estradiol and progesterone) to help diagnose:

The cause of infertility 
Pituitary disorders that can affect LH production
Conditions that affect the function of the ovaries or testicles

In women, LH levels are useful for:

Investigating irregular periods (menstrual cycles)
Evaluating LH levels during the menstrual cycle. Multiple urine LH tests may be ordered for this purpose. These LH ""spot tests"" can be performed at home and used to detect the surge in LH that indicates that ovulation will occur in the next 1-2 days. The tests can help determine when a woman is likely to be the most fertile.

GNRH stimulation test:
In people with signs and symptoms of poor ovarian or testicular function, a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) stimulation test may be performed. GnRH is the hormone produced by the hypothalamus that stimulates the pituitary to release LH and FSH. This test allows for assessment of the pituitary gland’s ability to make LH in response to GnRH administration. For this test, a baseline blood sample is drawn and then the person is given an injection of GnRH. Subsequent blood samples are drawn at specified times and the level of LH is measured. This test can help differentiate between a disorder of the pituitary (secondary), when the serum LH level will not increase in response to GnRH, or hypothalamus (tertiary), when LH will increase in response to GnRH injection.
In children, FSH and LH tests are used in the diagnosis of delayed and precocious (early) puberty. Irregular timing of puberty may be an indication of a more serious problem involving the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the ovaries or testicles, or other systems. The measurement of LH and FSH can help in differentiating between benign symptoms and true disease. The GnRH stimulation test can assess pituitary function in pubertal disorders: the increase of serum LH to a certain level in response to administration of GnRH would suggest a pituitary gland that is primed for pubertal hormone responses. Further testing can then be done to discern the underlying cause.

magnesium,"['Mg', 'Mag']","

For a blood sample, overnight fasting may be required; follow any instructions that you are given.


","

To evaluate the level of magnesium in your blood and to help determine the cause of abnormal levels of magnesium, calcium and/or potassium


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm; sometimes a timed urine collection that most often requires a 24-hour sample collection


","



Magnesium is a mineral that is vital for energy production, muscle contraction, nerve function, and the maintenance of strong bones. It comes into the body through the diet and is absorbed by the small intestine and colon. Magnesium is stored in the bones, cells, and tissues. Normally, only about 1% of total body magnesium is present in the blood and this makes it difficult to get an accurate measurement of total magnesium content from blood tests alone. However, this test is still useful for evaluating a person's magnesium status.
A wide variety of foods contain small amounts of magnesium, especially green vegetables such as spinach, as well as whole grains and nuts. Foods that have dietary fiber are usually also sources of magnesium. The body maintains its magnesium level by regulating how much it absorbs and how much it excretes or conserves in the kidneys.
Magnesium deficiencies (hypomagnesemia) may be seen with malnutrition, conditions that cause malabsorption, and with excess loss of magnesium by the kidneys. Magnesium excess (hypermagnesemia) may be seen with the ingestion of antacids that contain magnesium and with decreased ability of the kidneys to excrete magnesium.
Someone with mild to moderate magnesium deficiency may have no or few nonspecific symptoms. Persistent or severe deficiencies can cause nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue, confusion, muscle cramps, seizures, changes in heart rate, and numbness or tingling. They can also affect calcium metabolism and exacerbate calcium deficiencies. Symptoms of excess magnesium can be similar to those of deficiency and include nausea, muscle weakness, loss of appetite, and an irregular heart rate.

Magnesium testing may be ordered as a follow up to chronically low blood levels of calcium and potassium. It also may be ordered when a person has symptoms that may be due to a magnesium deficiency, such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping, confusion, cardiac arrhythmias, and seizures. Magnesium depletion is known to be linked to severe alcohol intake or due to irregular or bad absorption of magnesium in the intestine.
A healthcare practitioner may order a magnesium level to check for a deficiency as part of an evaluation of malabsorption, malnutrition, diarrhea, or alcoholism. When someone is taking medications that can cause the kidneys to excrete magnesium, testing may be performed as well. When magnesium and/or calcium supplementation is necessary, the level of magnesium in the blood may be checked at intervals to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
When an individual has a kidney disorder or uncontrolled diabetes, a magnesium test may be ordered periodically, along with kidney function tests such as a BUN and creatinine, to help monitor kidney function and to make sure that the person is not excreting or retaining excessive amounts of magnesium.



","



Low blood levels of magnesium may indicate that a person is not consuming or absorbing enough magnesium or is eliminating too much from the body.
Decreased magnesium levels are typically seen with:

Low dietary intake, which may be seen in the elderly, people who are malnourished or those with alcoholism 
Digestive disorders (such as Crohn disease) 
Uncontrolled diabetes 
Hypoparathyroidism 
Long-term diuretic use 
Prolonged diarrhea 
Post-surgery
Severe burns
Pre-eclampsia

High blood levels of magnesium are rarely due to dietary sources but are usually the result of excessive supplementation or a problem with eliminating it from the body.
Increased magnesium levels are seen in:

End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
Hyperparathyroidism 
Hypothyroidism 
Dehydration
Diabetic acidosis (when first seen)
Addison disease 
Use of magnesium-containing antacids or laxatives




","



Since magnesium is an electrolyte, a magnesium test may be ordered along with other electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate (or total CO2), calcium, and phosphorus to evaluate a person's electrolyte balance. If magnesium is low, it is not unusual for potassium also to be low.
Magnesium blood levels tend to be decreased in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
Normal levels of magnesium do not necessarily reflect total body stores of magnesium. The body attempts to keep blood magnesium levels relatively stable and will release magnesium from bone and tissues to accomplish this. So, the blood level may be normal with early magnesium deficiencies.
Drugs that can increase magnesium levels include lithium, aspirin, thyroid medication, some antibiotics, and products that contain magnesium. Drugs that can decrease magnesium levels include digoxin, cyclosporine, diuretics, insulin, some antibiotics, laxatives, and phenytoin.



",,"



A magnesium test is used to measure the level of magnesium in the blood (or sometimes urine). Abnormal levels of magnesium are most frequently seen in conditions or diseases that cause impaired or excessive excretion of magnesium by the kidneys or that cause impaired absorption in the intestines. Magnesium levels may be checked as part of an evaluation of the severity of kidney problems and/or of uncontrolled diabetes and may help in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders.
Since a low magnesium blood level can, over time, cause persistently low calcium and potassium levels, it may be checked to help diagnose problems with calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and/or parathyroid hormone – another component of calcium regulation.
Magnesium levels may be measured frequently to monitor the response to oral or intravenous (IV) magnesium supplements. The test for magnesium may be ordered, along with calcium and phosphorus testing, to monitor calcium supplementation.

Cannabis, also referred to as marijuana, is a plant of the species Cannabis sativa that has psychoactive effects. Marijuana contains many chemical compounds that interact with the body, called cannabinoids. The main mind-altering cannabinoid in marijuana is THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The body breaks down THC into several inactive metabolites (e.g., THC-COOH, 11-nor-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). Since the metabolites of THC stay in the body for a longer period of time than THC does, most marijuana testing detects the presence of THC-COOH or other metabolites in urine. Some tests also detect the active compound, THC, for example when marijuana testing is done using blood or saliva.
Marijuana leaves can be smoked, prepared and eaten in food products, or ingested as a tincture. Smoking or ingesting marijuana causes a faster heartbeat and pulse rate, bloodshot eyes, and dry mouth and throat. It may cause short- and long-term effects, including impaired short-term memory, altered sense of time, decreased ability to concentrate, altered reaction time, decreased coordination, increased risk of psychosis, and cyclic episodes of nausea, stomach pain and vomiting. Marijuana use impairs driving ability, and accident risk greatly increases if the driver is also drinking alcohol. Marijuana today has higher THC concentrations than in the past, which can lead to greater levels of impairment.
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit substance as defined by U.S. federal law. However, marijuana is used both recreationally and medicinally, and its use has been legalized in a number of states and Canada.
Marijuana as medicine
Some people use marijuana to treat a variety of conditions. Due to legal restrictions on marijuana, its therapeutic effects and safety have been difficult to research.
Natural cannabis may be obtained in some states with a medical marijuana card, an identification card issued by the state with a healthcare practitioner's recommendation. It allows a patient to obtain, possess, and/or grow marijuana for medicinal use. The process for obtaining these cards varies by state.
Synthetic forms or purified forms of THC and other cannabinoids are available as prescription medications that can be taken by mouth, inhaled, or sprayed under the tongue.

Dronabinol and nabilone are two drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that contain THC. They are sometimes prescribed to treat chemotherapy-associated nausea that does not respond to standard treatments.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound related to THC that is a product of the marijuana plant. It is available in liquid form (CBD oil) as an FDA-approved medication that may be used to treat pain and inflammation and some epileptic seizures. Some ""herbal supplements"" also contain CBD but are not regulated by the FDA. Unlike THC, CBD is not intoxicating—it does not make people ""high."" However, because CBD is derived from the marijuana plant, it may contain variable amounts of THC.
Nabiximols is a marijuana-derived prescription drug that contains THC and CBD. It may be used to treat muscle control problems in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Though this drug has not been approved by the FDA, it has been approved for use in Canada, the United Kingdom, and some European countries.

Anything that contains THC has the potential to be detected as THC or THC-COOH in a marijuana test. In medical cases, drug testing results are typically reported to the physicians who ordered the tests and they interpret the meaning of results in the context of the medical cases. To aid the interpretation of results, patients should notify their physicians of any over-the-counter or prescription medications (including marijuana) or supplements they are taking.
Marijuana laws and policies
Drug testing policy for THC can become confusing due to conflicting state and federal laws and policies. Marijuana is a Schedule 1 drug according to U.S. federal law. The government considers Schedule 1 drugs to have high potential for abuse, lack evidence of safety and effectiveness, with no currently accepted medical use in the U.S.
Since 1986, U.S. federal employees and employees in federally-regulated jobs that affect public safety like transportation and air traffic control have been prohibited from using illegal drugs. In U.S. federally regulated tests, no marijuana use is considered legitimate, except in the case of prescription synthetic THC, such as dronabinol. Private employers not under federal drug testing regulations are free to determine their own drug testing policies and may or may not test for marijuana use.
If someone is given a drug test for legal or employment purposes while taking a prescription form of THC, they should report their prescription to the physician who will review the test results (Medical Review Officer or MRO) and/or list it under 'prescriptions' in the appropriate space on the specimen collection form. Positive drug testing results that are due to prescription medications may be reported by the MRO as ""negative.""
Marijuana testing
To test for marijuana, healthcare practitioners may send urine samples to a laboratory for screening or they may perform a test in their office. Testing may be performed with point-of-care tests, which are typically small strips that are dipped into the urine and interpreted by the appearance or absence of a colored line on the strip.
Positive screening tests for marijuana are presumptive. This is because all drug screening tests have the potential for false-positive results. Therefore, screening tests that are positive are often confirmed with a second test, which is referred to as a confirmatory test. Confirmatory tests are usually more sensitive and specific than screening tests. Confirmatory testing is usually performed with an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Types of mass spectrometry tests used for confirmatory testing include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Additional testing may also be performed to identify whether any substance has been added to the urine sample, such as water, bleach, or other types of chemicals (adulterants) in an attempt to interfere with the test result. If adulteration is suspected, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.
Urine samples may also be identified as dilute. Dilute urine may be produced if an individual drinks large amounts of water or other liquids prior to testing. Dilute urine may also result from some medical conditions. If an individual adds liquid such as water to a urine sample, this may also cause dilute urine. It may not always be possible to determine how the urine was diluted. If the urine is so dilute that the results are not reliable, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.

Medical Screening
Marijuana testing may be ordered by a healthcare practitioner, usually as part of a drug testing panel, during a medical evaluation or addiction treatment when a person is known or suspected of substance abuse or when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest drug use, including confusion or otherwise abnormal or dangerous behavior. Testing may also be ordered as part of general health screenings prior to the start of some insurance policies.
Legal, Forensic or Employment Testing
Forensic THC testing is performed when an employer or legal entity needs to determine if a person may have used marijuana. It may be ordered randomly or routinely as part of employment screening, during the hiring process, or part of broader drug testing in legal or forensic scenarios, such as after an accident. Testing may be ordered at random to satisfy court-ordered monitoring or probation requirements.



","



Just as for other types of lab tests, both screening and confirmatory tests are interpreted based on a defined cutoff level (e.g., 50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) for urine samples). If a drug is not present, or if the drug is present at a concentration below the test cutoff, the test will be reported as ""undetected,"" ""absent"" or ""negative."" If a drug is present at a concentration equal to or above the cutoff, the test will be reported as ""detected,"" ""present"", ""presumptive positive"" or ""positive.""
A positive or detected initial THC screening result means that the person tested may have used marijuana. Since screening tests are not definitive, confirmatory testing is typically done to verify the results. A positive confirmatory test means the person had THC or THC-COOH in their body when the sample was collected, but it does not confirm when THC was used or ingested.
Testing urine for THC cannot be used to determine the source of THC or its metabolites, time of exposure, amount, or the person's level of impairment.
A negative result does not necessarily mean that the person did not use marijuana. The person's THC levels may be below an established cutoff or the THC may have been already metabolized and eliminated from the body.
Detection times for marijuana vary widely depending on an individual's metabolism, the dose, and frequency of use. Testing can indicate use anywhere from 3 days to more than 30 days prior to testing. Chronic, heavy users of marijuana may test positive for even longer than 30 days after last use.



","



As states legalize marijuana, roadside testing for driver impairment due to marijuana use has become an urgent issue. This is a challenging testing problem because THC concentrations in the blood drop off quickly and the degree of impairment THC causes varies widely from person to person. That makes it very difficult to set a single legal level of THC in the blood, as is set with alcohol. While THC is currently the compound tested most often in blood to determine impairment, other cannabinoids are under investigation.
Some states, like Colorado, currently use blood testing and a cutoff concentration for THC in the absence of a better option. They are also piloting roadside oral fluid testing as a solution for determining impairment. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome before these tests are reliable.



","



Marijuana testing is used to detect the presence of the plant’s active chemicals or their breakdown products (metabolites), most commonly in urine or saliva. Marijuana testing may be used to screen for and confirm the presence of THC or THC metabolites that indicate marijuana or prescription cannabinoid use. Most marijuana tests look for an inactive metabolite of THC (THC-COOH), which stays in the body longer than THC itself.
Marijuana testing may be used for:
Medical Screening
Marijuana may be included in a panel of drug tests used for medical screening. This testing is used to determine what drugs or combination of drugs a person may have taken so that the person can receive proper medical treatment. With marijuana legalization in some areas, some clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals are no longer including marijuana testing in their drug testing panels.
A healthcare practitioner may order drug testing for medical reasons if an individual:

Is being treated in an addiction recovery or chemical dependency program
Is being treated for chronic pain, to ensure that the person is taking mediation as prescribed
Experiences symptoms that may be drug-related or shows signs of intoxication, such as unconsciousness, nausea, delirium, panic, paranoia, increased temperature, chest pain, respiratory failure, seizures, and/or headaches
Is involved in an accident that an emergency room physician suspects may be due to drug intoxication
Is suspected of drug abuse or is known to use illegal drugs
Is a candidate to receive an organ transplant
Is being treated for cancer
Is pregnant or has recently given birth, especially if she is thought to be at risk for drug abuse or has a newborn baby exhibiting certain characteristic behaviors
Is an applicant for a life insurance policy, as part of an overall health evaluation

For a more in-depth discussion of medical drug screening, see the article Emergency and Overdose Drug Testing.
Legal, Forensic and Employment Testing
Drug testing for legal, forensic, or employment purposes differs from medical testing in sample collection procedures. Sample collection for forensic testing is strictly controlled, with the custody of a sample continuously documented to maintain a legal ""chain-of-custody."" After a sample is provided, it is closed and secured with a tamperproof seal. A custody and control form accompanies the sample throughout all handling, testing, and storage. This creates a continuous legally binding record for the sample. Test results are usually reviewed by a specially trained and licensed physician called a medical review officer prior to reporting.
Examples of this type of testing include:

Court-mandated testing for someone who has been convicted of illegal drug use
Testing or monitoring of a parent in a child custody case
Forensic toxicology testing using a variety of body fluids and tissues that may be tested during a crime investigation; the goal may be to determine whether marijuana was a contributing factor to an accident or crime, such as DUI (driving under the influence).
Some athletic programs may test for marijuana as part of a general toxicology screen to detect performance-enhancing drug abuse in athletes.

Marijuana testing may also be required by an employer. This is also referred to as ""workplace drug testing,"" a specific type of forensic testing. It may be done prior to employment, on a random basis, following an accident, or if an employer has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is using illegal drugs.
Employment drug testing is common. It is required for employees of the U.S. Department of Transportation, military personnel, and other federal employees, and is an accepted practice in many other industries.
For additional information on this type of testing, see the article on The World of Forensic Laboratory Testing.

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Maternal serum screening, or the multiple marker test, measures several substances in the blood of a pregnant woman in the second trimester of pregnancy. The results can be used to determine the risk that the baby has a chromosome disorder or neural tube defect such as spina bifida.
These substances include the following, listed below. When the first three substances are measured together, it is called a triple screen. When the fourth substance, inhibin A, is added, it is called a quad screen.

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a protein produced by fetal tissue. During development, AFP levels in fetal blood and amniotic fluid rise until about 12 weeks, and then levels gradually fall until birth. Some AFP crosses the placenta into the mother's blood. With certain problems affecting a baby, an increased amount of AFP leaks into amniotic fluid and then into the mother's blood. As such, an AFP test is used to screen for neural tube defects such as spina bifida. It may be performed as part of the triple or quad screen. It may be performed by itself when risk for chromosome disorders (Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)) have already been assessed using first trimester Down syndrome screening or cell-free fetal DNA testing. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the AFP test detects neural tube defects in 85% of the cases.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta. Levels in maternal blood rise for the first trimester of pregnancy and then decrease during the remainder of the pregnancy. In pregnancies where the fetus is carrying the chromosomal defect that results in Down syndrome, hCG tends to be high whereas in pregnancies where the fetus has the chromosomal defect that results in Edwards syndrome, hCG tends to be low.
Unconjugated estriol (uE3) is a form of estrogen that is produced by the fetus through metabolism. This process involves the liver, adrenals, and the placenta. Some of the unconjugated estriol crosses the placenta and can be measured in the mother's blood. Levels rise around the 8th week and continue to increase until shortly before delivery. In pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome, uE3 tends to be low.
Inhibin A is a hormone produced by the placenta. Inhibin is a dimer (has two parts) and is sometimes referred to as DIA or dimeric inhibin A. Levels in maternal blood decrease slightly from 14 to 17 weeks gestation and then rise again. Levels tend to be higher in pregnancies where the fetus has Down syndrome.

Including the fourth marker, inhibin A, increases both the sensitivity and specificity of the screen for Down syndrome. According to ACOG, the triple screen detects Down syndrome in 69% of the cases while the quad screen detects it in 81% of the cases.
If the results of maternal serum screening are cause for concern, diagnostic tests such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may be recommended.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Blood is drawn from a vein in the woman's arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

Your healthcare practitioner may offer you the test between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy.

A genetic counselor or healthcare practitioner who can explain the meaning of the results and offer choices about follow up should interpret the screening results.
It is important to remember that positive screening tests are not diagnostic of a fetal abnormality. While they indicate an increased risk, only a small number of women who have positive maternal serum screening results have babies who actually have a neural tube defect or chromosomal abnormality.
In pregnancies where the fetus is carrying the chromosomal defect that results in Down syndrome (trisomy 21), the levels of AFP and unconjugated estriol tend to be low and hCG and inhibin A levels high.
In pregnancies where the fetus has Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), unconjugated estriol and hCG levels are low and AFP levels can be variable.
A baby with an open neural tube defect has an opening in its spine or head that allows higher-than-usual amounts of AFP to pass into the mother's blood. The other markers are not used in the evaluation of risk for carrying a fetus with a neural tube defect.

If a screen is positive, tests that are more definitive are needed to determine and confirm a diagnosis. These include high-resolution ultrasound and perhaps amniocentesis followed by chromosome analysis. These follow-up tests are used to help women and their healthcare practitioners make decisions about managing their pregnancies.
Screening will not detect all cases of fetal abnormalities.



","



The test result is very dependent on accurate determination of the gestational age of the fetus. If the gestational age of the fetus has not been accurately determined, the results may be either falsely high or low.
In multiple gestation pregnancies, calculation of the risk of Down syndrome or Edwards syndrome is difficult. For twin pregnancies, a ""pseudorisk"" can be calculated comparing results to normal results in other twin pregnancies.
Evaluation of the risk of open neural tube defects in twin pregnancies can be determined, although it is not as effective as in singleton pregnancies. For women further along in their pregnancies, risk cannot be calculated from these tests.
If you have had a first trimester Down syndrome screen, then second trimester maternal serum screening is typically not performed because the risks for Down syndrome and Edwards syndrome have already been assessed. However, if you and your healthcare practitioner wish to use the results of both first trimester and second trimester screening to assess the risk of chromosome abnormalities, then integrated or sequential screening may be employed. For more on these, see below.

Maternal serum screening is a group of tests used in the second trimester of pregnancy to help evaluate a woman's risk of carrying a baby with chromosome disorders, including Down syndrome (trisomy 21) or Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), or neural tube defects such as spina bifida or a condition called anencephaly.
The tests are often combined into a triple or quad screen because their value lies in their use together. A mathematical calculation involving the levels of these substances (AFP, hCG, unconjugated estriol, and, sometimes, inhibin A) as well as considerations of maternal age, family history, weight, race, and diabetic status is used to determine a numeric risk for abnormalities in the fetus.
The second trimester maternal serum screen is one of the options that may be offered for prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities. Others options include the first trimester screen and cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) testing.
An AFP test may be performed by itself and not as part of a triple or quad screen, especially when first trimester screening or cffDNA testing has already been used to assess the risk for a chromosomal disorder. The AFP is used to help determine the risk of neural tube defects.
The screening approach a woman may choose depends on what technology is available and when she first seeks prenatal care. For more information about how maternal serum screening fits in with other screening options, see below.

A blood sample drawn from a vein for measles or mumps antibody testing; to detect the virus itself, the sample may be blood, urine, nasopharyngeal (nasal) aspirate/washing, throat swab, swab of the inside of the cheek (buccal swab)


","



Measles (rubeola) and mumps are viruses that are members of the Paramyxoviridae family. They both cause infections that usually resolve within several days but can sometimes cause serious complications in certain cases. Both are preventable through vaccination.
Measles and mumps testing may include:

Testing for antibodies in the blood that develop in response to measles or mumps infection 
Testing for viral genetic material (RNA) in a sample using a molecular method such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This method may be used for a variety of samples. (Read ""How is it used?"" below for more testing details.)

The number of cases of measles and mumps infections in the U.S. has decreased because most people have received the MMR vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella. In recent years, the majority of new cases in the U.S. have occurred in occasional outbreaks (epidemics), primarily in people who have not been vaccinated, especially those who have traveled to areas of the world where measles or mumps are more prevalent.
Measles, also called rubeola, is a virus that infects cells in the lungs and the back of the throat. It is an extremely contagious viral infection that is easily spread through coughing and sneezing or touching a surface contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. According to the Centers for disease control and Prevention (CDC), the measles virus can live for up to two hours in the air where an infected person coughed or sneezed. Infected individuals are contagious for a couple of days before the symptoms appear.
About 1 to 2 weeks after infection, measles causes symptoms such as:

A high fever 
Dry cough
Red eyes 
Light sensitivity 
Runny nose 
Sore throat 
Tiny white spots inside the mouth 
A typical rash that starts on the face and spreads down the body to the trunk and legs

Most people recover within a couple of weeks, but up to 20% develop complications that may include an ear infection, bronchitis, pneumonia, diarrhea, or more rarely encephalitis or blindness. Although it is rare, one to two people, usually babies or young children, out of every thousand people infected, will die from a measles infection. People who are malnourished, have a vitamin A deficiency, or have weakened immune systems have increased risk of severe infections. Women who are pregnant when they are infected with measles are at a greater risk of miscarriage or of premature labor.
Vaccination has drastically reduced the number of people affected by measles in the United States and in many parts of the world, but the World Health Organization (WHO) still lists measles as a leading cause of death in young children. According to their estimates, measles causes about 450 deaths each day worldwide.
In 2000, endemic measles (measles continuously present in the population) was declared to be eliminated in the U.S. However, outbreaks continue to occur on an annual basis. Most cases are occurring in those people who are unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status, and most outbreaks are tied to travel to areas of the world where measles outbreaks are occurring.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2014, the U.S. had the highest number of measles cases reported in 20 years, with more than 600 cases. Many were linked to travelers who had visited the Philippines, where an exceptionally large outbreak of more than 50,000 cases occurred. Current CDC estimates for 2018 are 372 cases from 17 outbreaks, and for January to mid-March 2019 are 268 cases from six outbreaks. According to WHO, in 2018 there were 41,000 children and adults in Europe infected with measles in the first six months of that year. This estimate was much higher than any of the 12-month totals reported in Europe from 2000-2017.
The CDC and the U.S. and global medical communities remain concerned and vigilant. Measles is still common in many areas of the world, there is always the risk of travelers spreading measles, and there continue to be some unvaccinated individuals (including children too young for vaccination).
Mumps is a contagious viral infection that is easily spread through coughing, sneezing, talking, or by sharing items or touching surfaces with respiratory droplets or saliva on them (e.g. cups, utensils). About 2 to 3 weeks after infection you typically develop flu-like symptoms such as:

Headache

Followed by typical parotitis – swelling of the salivary (parotid) glands below one or both ears

For most people, mumps is a mild, self-limited illness, but some may develop complications such as temporary or permanent deafness, inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) or ovaries (oophoritis), pancreatitis, meningitis, or encephalitis.
Mumps, a milder illness than measles, is much less widespread than it used to be but is still common in many parts of the world. According to the CDC, mumps cases in the U.S. range from about 200 to 2,000 a year. In the first two months of 2019, for instance, there were 151 cases of mumps reported to the CDC from 30 states and the District of Columbia.Outbreaks can occur in environments where people come in close contact, such as classrooms, sports teams, or in college dormitories. During 2011-2013, for example, several small outbreaks occurred on college campuses in California, Maryland, and Virginia, but their spread was very limited.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Antibody testing requires a blood sample, obtained by inserting a needle into a vein. Viral molecular testing may be performed on a variety of samples, including nasopharyngeal (nasal) aspirate/washing, throat swab or a swab of the inside of the cheek (buccal swab).
A nasopharyngeal swab is collected by having a person tip their head back and then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip with a small head) is gently inserted into one of their nostrils until resistance is met. It is left in place for several seconds, then rotated several times to collect cells, and withdrawn. This is not painful, but it may tickle a bit and cause your eyes to tear. For a nasal aspirate, a syringe is used to push a small amount of sterile saline into the nose and then gentle suction is applied to collect the resulting fluid.
In order to fully evaluate a suspected measles case, the CDC recommends the collection of blood as well as samples for RT-PCR testing. For mumps, the CDC recommends the collection of blood and a buccal swab.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Prior to collection of a buccal swab for mumps, the salivary gland located in front of and below the ear (parotid gland) is massaged. For other specimens, no test preparation is needed.

When you have signs and symptoms or complications that may be due to a measles or mumps infection; when it is necessary or desired to determine measles or mumps immunity; when an outbreak is occurring in order to track the spread of measles or mumps in the community and prevent spread to others


","



An IgG antibody test for measles or mumps may be ordered when your health practitioner wants to determine whether you are immune to one or both of the viruses, either because of a previous infection or due to vaccination.
Measles or mumps IgM and IgG antibody tests or PCR may be ordered when you have typical signs and symptoms of measles or mumps or when you have had contact with an infected individual and now have symptoms that could be due to measles or mumps. 
Signs and symptoms of measles develop about 7 to 18 days after infection and usually include one or more of the following:

A characteristic rash that usually starts on the face and spreads down the body to the trunk and legs
High fever
Dry cough
Red, watery, itchy eyes
Sensitivity to light
A runny nose
Sore throat
Tiny white spots inside the mouth
	 

Signs and symptoms of mumps typically develop about 2 to 3 weeks after infection and often resemble symptoms of the flu, such as:

Headache
Muscle aches
Fever
These are followed by characteristic swelling of the salivary glands below one or both ears called parotitis.
	 

Testing may also be ordered during a suspected or confirmed outbreak, when several people may have been in contact with an infected person and are unvaccinated or have the signs and symptoms listed above.



","



Antibody testing
A positive IgM antibody test in someone who has not been recently vaccinated means it is likely that the person has a current measles or mumps infection. Positive IgM and IgG antibody tests or a fourfold increase in IgG levels (titers) in blood samples collected several days apart means it is likely that the person has a current or had a recent measles or mumps infection.
When measles or mumps IgG antibodies are present in a person who has been vaccinated and/or is not currently ill, then that person is protected against infection (immune). If a person does not have measles or mumps IgG antibodies, then that person is not considered immune to the viruses. 
The following table summarizes results that may be seen with antibody testing:



IgM
IgG
Possible Interpretation(s)


Positive
Negative
Early infection


Positive
Positive (with an increase in levels in blood samples collected several days apart; this would only be done if the IgM test is not available)
Current or recent infection


Negative
Positive
Immunity from prior infection or vaccination


Negative
Negative
No current or prior infection; not immune; no or low immune response due to compromised immune system



Viral detection
A positive measles or mumps PCR test for the virus's genetic material means that you have a current viral infection.
If a specific strain of measles or mumps virus is identified, then this genetic strain is the cause of the infection and the genetic information can be used to help determine the source of a measles or mumps infection, such as recent travel to a specific country or recent exposure to another person with an active infection. The result of measles or mumps genetic testing is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the spread of the virus, to identify cases that are part of outbreaks, and prevent further spread.
If the measles or mumps PCR test is negative, it may mean that you are not infected and signs and symptoms are due to another cause. However, a negative result does not necessarily rule out an active infection because the virus may have been present in numbers too low to detect or may not have been present in the sample tested. If an infection is strongly suspected after a negative result, repeat or follow-up testing may be done.



","



Viral cultures for measles and mumps are not routinely available but may occasionally be done on samples such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or washing, throat swab, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or urine,.to help make a diagnosis.



","



Measles and mumps tests may be used to:

Confirm that you are immune to the viruses due to previous infections or vaccination
Diagnose an active case of measles or mumps
Detect, monitor, and track outbreaks for public health purposes
	 

A few different methods are available to test for measles or mumps:
Antibody testing (serology)
Antibody testing detects the antibodies produced by the immune system in response to a measles or mumps infection or vaccine. This testing may be used to determine whether you are immune, diagnose an active case, or to track outbreaks. There are two classes of antibodies produced:

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first type of antibody produced after infection or vaccination. The IgM antibody level (titer) increases for several days, peaks, and then begin to taper off over the next few weeks.
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is produced later, but once they develoo, they remain in the body for life, providing protection against re-infection. Sometimes, two blood samples are collected several days apart (acute and convalescent samples) and the level of antibodies is measured and compared. This may help to differentiate between an active infection and a prior infection.
	 

Direct detection of the virus
Molecular methods such as PCR may be used to detect the measles or mumps virus directly in a sample. These methods only identify active infections and cannot confirm immunity.
Viral genetic testing (RT-PCR) detects and identifies the genetic strain of the virus. Most RT-PCR testing is performed by public health laboratories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Viral detection testing may occasionally be performed to identify the cause of severe complications that may be associated with an infection from the measles or mumps virus. Since people with weakened immune systems may not have a typical antibody response, a test to detect viral genetic material may be performed to confirm the diagnosis of a mumps or measles infection, especially if antibody results do not match clinical findings or a health practitioner's suspicions.

mercury,['Hg (chemical symbol)'],"

None needed; however, consult with your healthcare provider or laboratory about urine collection to avoid sample contamination.


","

To detect excessive exposure to mercury


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm and/or a random or 24-hour urine sample may be collected. Rarely, another sample such as hair, breast milk, or nails may be tested.


","



Mercury is an element that can be toxic in various forms, which are tested in different samples:

Metallic or elemental mercury is a liquid often used in dental fillings, some thermometers, and batteries. Urine samples are typically tested to detect this form of mercury.
Inorganic mercury salts, which are produced by the reaction of non-carbon based compounds with mercury, are normally in a form of powder or crystal and sometimes used in topical preparations such as skin-lightening or antiseptic creams. Urine samples are usually used to detect this form of mercury.
Methyl mercury and other organic mercury compounds are products of reactions between mercury and carbon-based organic compounds. Bacteria with elevated levels of methyl mercury are often found in large, older, predator fish such as sharks and king mackerel. People who eat these fish may be exposed to this form of mercury. Blood is primarily used to identify a high level of methyl mercury.

Mercury is found in small quantities throughout the environment. It is released by the breakdown of minerals in rocks and soils and as a byproduct of fossil fuel combustion and waste incineration. It is inhaled with the air that we breathe, absorbed through the skin, and ingested with food. Mercury is also used in some mirror coatings, pharmaceuticals, and agricultural chemicals. Energy efficient compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs contain small amounts of mercury, which is also used to make electrical equipment, wire, and switching devices.
The tiny amounts to which the vast majority of people are exposed do not generally cause health concerns. However, people may develop mercury-related symptoms or complications if they are exposed to dangerous concentrations of mercury, such as might be found at a hazardous waste site, or are exposed to mercury over long periods of time, especially if they work with heavy metals on the job.
Exposure to excessive amounts of mercury can be toxic. The amount of mercury absorbed by an individual and its effects on the person's health depends on the type of mercury, its concentration, and the nature of exposure. According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), very little metallic mercury (less than 0.01%) is absorbed by the body, even if it is swallowed. However, if the same mercury is inhaled as a vapor, about 80% is absorbed into the bloodstream.
About 95% of methyl mercury, which is the type found in fish and other seafood, is absorbed by the digestive tract. The most common source of human exposure to methyl mercury is eating contaminated seafood. Fish that come from contaminated waters and large predator fish that have eaten smaller fish may have significantly increased levels of methyl mercury. It is important to know the source of the fish that you consume and to limit the quantity of large predator fish eaten.
Once mercury is absorbed, the body may deposit it in a variety of body organs, including the kidneys and brain. The body will slowly rid itself of mercury through the urine and stool, but if an excessive amount accumulates, it can permanently damage the kidneys, nervous system, and brain.
Pregnant women with elevated levels of mercury can pass it on to their unborn baby, affecting development of the baby's brain, kidneys, and nerves especially. Mercury can also be passed from mother to baby through breast milk during nursing.

When you have signs and symptoms of mercury poisoning or have been exposed to mercury; to monitor occupational exposure to mercury


","



Mercury testing may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms suggesting excessive exposure to mercury. Acute signs and symptoms may include:

Burning in the mouth and lungs
Cough, difficulty breathing, chest tightness
Difficulty urinating and decreased urine output
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramping
Increased heart rate
Fever or chills
Dizziness
Headache
	 

Those who are chronically exposed may have nonspecific symptoms that involve the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system. Some of the chronic symptoms may include:

Problems with hearing, taste and smell
Blurry vision or sometimes tunnel vision
Tingling or tremors in the arms or legs
Difficulty walking
Irritability
Memory loss
	 

Testing may also be ordered even in the absence of symptoms when it is known that a person has been exposed to mercury in order to help evaluate the extent of the exposure.
Mercury measurements may be ordered on a regular basis to monitor people who work in industries that use mercury. It may be ordered, along with tests to detect lead and/or other heavy metals, for individuals who work with a variety of potentially hazardous materials.



","



Levels of mercury in blood and urine are normally very low. A test result showing no mercury or a low level indicates that it is likely that the person tested has not been exposed to excessive levels of mercury, at least not in the window of time that the test is measuring.
An increased blood level suggests a relatively recent exposure to mercury. In general, a blood level greater than 10 mcg/L indicates an unusual level of exposure for someone who does not regularly work with mercury.
In contrast to levels of mercury in the blood, a 24-hour urine sample gives more of an average past history of exposure to metallic or inorganic mercury. Normal urine levels are typically less than 10 mcg/L for someone without risk of occupational exposure. (For information on occupational exposure levels, see the Related Content section.)
Levels of mercury in either the blood or urine will not indicate the form or quantity of mercury to which a person was exposed.
An increased level of mercury in hair testing may indicate exposure to increased levels of methyl mercury, but hair samples are rarely used because of issues involving testing standardization, sample contamination, and the fact that hair is subject to many pre-analytical variables (hair exposure to dyes, bleach, shampoo, etc.).



","



Measures have been taken in recent years to reduce and control the public's exposure to mercury. Stricter regulations and recommendations have lowered the amounts allowable in the air, water, soil, food, and in the workplace.



","



Mercury testing is used to detect the presence of an excessive amount of mercury in a person's blood and/or urine sample. It may be ordered by a healthcare practitioner to determine whether a person has had short-term exposure to a toxic level of mercury (acute exposure) or has been exposed over an extended period of time (chronic exposure). Testing may also be used to monitor those who may be exposed to mercury in the workplace.
To test for the various forms of mercury, more than one type of sample may be collected and tested.

Blood is primarily tested to detect the presence of methyl mercury. Other forms of mercury (metallic and inorganic) can also be detected in the blood, but the amount present will decrease by half about every 3 days as the mercury moves into organs such as the brain and kidneys. Therefore, blood testing must be done within days of suspected exposure.
Urine is used to test for metallic mercury and inorganic forms of mercury, but it cannot be used to determine exposure to methyl mercury.
Hair testing may be useful to detect methyl mercury exposures that occurred several months previously, but hair testing is relatively complex and is not used frequently.
Although not routinely ordered tests, mercury has been shown to be present in nails, breast milk, stool, and breath.
	 

Other general laboratory tests may be used to help evaluate the health of various organ systems in someone who has been exposed or thought to be exposed to toxic levels of mercury. Some examples include a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and a complete blood count (CBC).

methotrexate,"['MTX ', 'Amethopterin']","

None, but timing of the sample for testing is important; your healthcare practitioner may specify collection at a certain number of hours after a methotrexate dose; when having your blood drawn, tell the person collecting your blood sample when you took your last dose of methotrexate.


","


To detect, monitor and evaluate toxic concentrations of methotrexate
To measure methotrexate levels in blood to determine the initial dosage requirement in individuals with immune disease



","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Methotrexate is a drug that is used to treat childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the lung, head, neck, and breast as well as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This test measures the amount of methotrexate in the blood.
Methotrexate prevents cells from using folate to make DNA and RNA, slowing growth of new cancer cells. Because it can also deter growth of new skin cells, methotrexate is also used to treat psoriasis. The drug blocks several enzymes involved in the immune system and can minimize joint damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
Methotrexate must be carefully monitored. Even when used correctly, it can cause significant side effects. Increased concentrations can be toxic, potentially damaging the liver, kidneys, and lungs and suppressing cell production in the bone marrow.
Methotrexate dosing depends upon the condition being treated. Methotrexate levels in the blood typically rise after a dose and then fall gradually. Methotrexate is eliminated from the body by the kidneys, so any condition that decreases kidney function or interferes with drug clearance has the potential to increase blood concentrations.

","

At specific timed intervals after a high dose of methotrexate to monitor blood levels and guide treatment and whenever symptoms suggest methotrexate toxicity


","



A methotrexate test is typically ordered at regular intervals (e.g., at 24 hours, 48 hours, and at 72 hours as needed) after administration of high-dose methotrexate. Tests to monitor blood cell counts and kidney and liver function are also ordered at regular intervals during methotrexate therapy.
A methotrexate test may also be ordered whenever a person has symptoms or signs that suggest methotrexate toxicity. It is rarely ordered in conjunction with low-dose methotrexate therapy.
Common side effects associated with methotrexate use (that may be seen without toxic concentrations of methotrexate) include:

Nausea
Thinning hair
Mouth sores, tender gums
Fatigue
Diarrhea
Sensitivity to sunlight
Headaches
Trouble sleeping
Low blood counts

More serious signs and symptoms seen with methotrexate toxicity include:

Dark stools or urine
Bruising and bleeding
Drug-induced hepatitis
Cough
Fever and chills
Shortness of breath
Chest pain
Abdominal pain
Bacterial septicemia
Severe skin rash
Seizures




","



With therapeutic drug monitoring, there is typically a ""therapeutic range,"" with a lower limit that is associated with effectiveness and an upper limit associated with unacceptable side effects and toxicity. With high-dose methotrexate, the primary focus is on an upper limit – toxicity, the drug's effect on the kidney, liver, and blood cell counts, and on unacceptable side effects.
Test results are used to guide the amount and timing of leucovorin (folinic acid) given as a ""rescue"" treatment.
Low-dose methotrexate is rarely monitored with a methotrexate test. The therapeutic concentration of the drug depends upon the condition and the timing of the blood collection.
Although the risks of side effects and organ damage increase with increasing levels of methotrexate, a person may experience side effects from methotrexate use without having high blood levels of the drug.



","



A variety of prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplements can interfere or interact with methotrexate, including aspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), phenytoin, retinol, theophylline, digoxin, sulfadiazine, warfarin, certain antibiotics, and vitamin E. Tell your healthcare practitioner about all prescription and over-the-counter medications and supplements that you take.
Excessive alcohol use can increase the risk of methotrexate-associated liver damage.
Methotrexate is eliminated from the body through the kidneys; thus, any kidney dysfunction will result in diminished release of methotrexate out of the body.
Sensitivity to methotrexate and associated side effects increase with age, while individuals' response to methotrexate therapy varies. Some of the variation in effectiveness and toxicity is thought to be due to genetic variations. Researchers are examining this idea and it may eventually lead to the clinical use of one or more genetic tests to help predict a person's response to methotrexate.



",,"



High-dose methotrexate therapy is monitored at regular intervals following a methotrexate dose. Testing detects toxic concentrations of methotrexate at these time points. A drug called leucovorin (folinic acid) can be given as a ""rescue"" treatment to protect a person from the toxic effects of methotrexate. The methotrexate test series identifies the need for leucovorin and guides the timing and amount of its administration.
Low-dose methotrexate therapy is rarely monitored by a methotrexate test. It is usually monitored by assessing the function of the kidney, the liver, and bone marrow cell production. Testing may include a complete blood count (CBC) to measure red blood cell counts, white blood cell counts, and platelets; a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine to evaluate kidney function; and a liver panel (or one or more of its component tests) to evaluate liver function.

methylmalonic-acid,['MMA'],"

Fasting is typically required for the blood test. For a random urine sample, you should fast overnight, discard the first urine sample of the morning, and then collect the second sample.


","

To help detect early and/or mild vitamin B12 deficiency; sometimes to help diagnose newborns with methylmalonic acidemia, a rare inherited metabolic disorder


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. For newborns, blood may be collected from a heelstick. A single random urine sample may be collected (the second morning sample is preferred) or a 24-hour collection of urine may be requested.


","



Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is a substance produced in very small amounts and is necessary for human metabolism and energy production. This test measures the level of MMA in blood or sometimes urine.
Vitamin B12 is responsible for two critical enzymatic reactions that promote cell metabolism. B12 promotes the conversion of methylmalonyl CoA (a form of MMA) to succinyl Coenzyme A, and with folic acid, aids in converting homocysteine to methionne.
Blood and/or urine levels of MMA rise when your B12 level begins to decrease. The measurement of elevated amounts of methylmalonic acid in the blood or urine serves as a sensitive and early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency.
A B12 deficiency can occur when your nutrition intake is poor or you have gastrointestinal malabsorption issues. Over time, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause blood cell changes, leading to anemia and the production of large red blood cells (macrocytes). It can also cause signs and symptoms of neuropathy, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet and/or, in advanced cases, mental or behavioral changes such as cognitive impairment, confusion, irritability, and depression. An increased concentration of MMA is often detectable even before B12 levels abnormally decrease, presence of blood cell changes, and/or before full-blown symptoms are apparent, though some people may have some degree of neuropathy.
The relationship between MMA and B12 has been known for over 40 years, but the use of MMA testing is not widespread nor is there agreement on its usefulness. Because a relatively large amount of the B12 found in the blood is bound to proteins and is not biologically active, some in the medical community think that MMA may be a better measure of bioavailable B12 than the usual vitamin B12 test. Others believe that MMA and homocysteine (which may also be elevated when either B12 or folate is deficient) are valuable in detecting early and mild cases of B12 deficiency. Still others argue that many of the mild deficiencies detected do not progress to more severe deficiencies and do not necessarily need to be identified or treated.

When you have a low vitamin B12 level and/or have symptoms of B12 deficiency such as numbness, tingling in the hands or feet, trouble walking, swelling of body tissues, or yellowing of the skin or eyes; as part of newborn screening (see Common Questions)


","



MMA is usually ordered, sometimes along with a homocysteine test, when your vitamin B12 test result is in the lower portion of the normal range, especially when you have symptoms associated with B12 deficiency, or if one or more risk factors are present.
Signs and symptoms of B12 deficiency may include:

Diarrhea
Dizziness
Fatigue, muscle weakness
Loss of appetite
Pale skin
Rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeats
Shortness of breath
Sore tongue and mouth
Tingling, numbness, and/or burning in the feet, hands, arms, and legs (with B12 deficiency)
Confusion or forgetfulness
Paranoia




","



If your MMA and homocysteine levels are increased and your vitamin B12 level is mildly decreased, then an early or mild B12 deficiency may be present. This may indicate a decrease in your available B12 at the tissue level.
If only your homocysteine level is elevated and not MMA, then you may have a folate deficiency. This distinction is important because giving folate to someone who is B12-deficient will treat the anemia but does not treat the neurologic damage, which may be irreversible.
If both your MMA and homocysteine levels are normal, then it is unlikely that you have a B12 deficiency.
A decreased level of MMA is not common and is not considered clinically significant.



","



An elevated MMA test may indicate a B12 deficiency, but the amount of MMA measured does not necessarily reflect the severity of the deficiency, its likelihood of progressing, or the presence or severity of any symptoms.
If you have kidney disease, you may have a high level of MMA in your blood. If your kidneys are not functioning properly, they cannot properly eliminate MMA in the urine, causing MMA to accumulate in the blood.
Some studies have found a high variation in MMA levels when they are measured over time.



","



The methylmalonic acid (MMA) test may be used to help diagnose an early or mild vitamin B12 deficiency. It may be ordered by itself but generally with a homocysteine test as a follow-up to a vitamin B12 test result that is in the lower end of the normal range.
There are currently no official guidelines for screening for average-risk adults. Testing may be warranted for asymptomatic adults with one or more risk factors, such as when you are elderly with inconsistent nutrition practices, in alcoholics, strict vegans/vegetarians, or when you have taken certain drugs, like Metformin, proton pump inhibitors, or H2 receptor antagonists for a long time. Also, cancer patients who have gastrointestinal malabsorption problems, have a poor dietary intake, or have had certain surgeries may be tested for B12 deficiency. In general, confirmation tests for MMA and/or homocysteine may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of B12 deficiency. MMA is a very sensitive test in indicating a B12 deficiency. It is more specific than homocysteine and is the confirmatory test of choice for a B12 deficiency.

To detect and help diagnose infectious mononucleosis (mono)


","

A blood sample drawn from pricking of your fingertip or from a vein in your arm


","



Infectious mononucleosis, commonly called mono, refers to an infection usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The mono test detects proteins in the blood called heterophile antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to an EBV infection.
Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by a particular set of symptoms that most often affects adolescents. People who have mono often have a fever, sore throat, swollen glands, and fatigue. Many will also have an enlarged spleen, and a few may have an enlarged liver. Symptoms of the infection usually arise about one month after the initial infection and may last for several weeks. The associated fatigue may last for several months. Mono is usually a self-limiting condition; the symptoms resolve without any specific treatment.
Epstein-Barr virus is very common and very contagious. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people in the United States are infected by EBV at some point in their lives. The virus is present in the saliva of an infected person and is easily spread from person to person through close contact such as kissing and through sharing utensils or cups.
Most of the time, EBV infection occurs in childhood and causes few or no symptoms. However, it can cause symptoms associated with infectious mononucleosis in about 25% of teens and young adults, according to the CDC. Mono can affect anyone at any age, but its prevalence is highest in populations of young people, such as students in high schools or colleges, or in the military.
The mono test is 71% to 90% accurate and may be used as an initial test for diagnosing infectious mononucleosis. However, the test does have a 25% false-negative rate due to the fact that some people infected with EBV do not produce the heterophile antibodies that the mono test is designed to detect. If a mono test is negative and suspicion it still high, then a test specific for EBV antibodies is usually performed.
A complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear are usually also performed, as mono is also characterized by a high white blood cell (WBC) count and the presence of atypical white blood cells (usually reported as reactive lymphocytes) as seen on a blood smear.
According to the CDC, examples of other causes of mono include:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
Hepatitis A, hepatitis B or hepatitis C
HIV
Rubella
Toxoplasmosis

When a person, especially an adolescent, has symptoms of mononucleosis, including fever, sore throat, swollen glands, and fatigue


","



The mono test is primarily ordered when a person, especially a teen or young adult, has symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects are due to infectious mononucleosis. Symptoms can sometimes be confused with those of a cold or the flu. Some of the more common signs and symptoms of mono include:

Fever
Headache
Sore throat
Swollen glands in the neck and/or armpits
Extreme weakness or fatigue

Some people may experience additional signs and symptoms such as:

Stomach pain
Enlarged liver and/or spleen
Rash

The test may be repeated when it is initially negative but suspicion of mono remains high.



","



A positive mono test with an increased number of white blood cells and reactive lymphocytes on a blood smear in the presence of symptoms associated with mono indicates a likely diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis.
A negative mono test requires careful interpretation.

If symptoms and reactive lymphocytes are present but the mono test is negative, then it may be too early to detect the heterophile antibodies or the affected person may be one of a small percentage of people who do not make heterophile antibodies. The mono test may be repeated at a later time and/or tests specific for EBV antibodies may be performed to help confirm or rule out the mononucleosis diagnosis.
Most infants and young children will not make heterophile antibodies, so they will have negative mono tests even when infected with EBV. This population is rarely tested, however, because they do not usually have symptoms of infectious mononucleosis.
People with negative mono tests and few or no reactive lymphocytes may be infected by another microorganism that is causing symptoms, such as a cytomegalovirus (CMV) or toxoplasmosis. If the infection occurs during pregnancy, it can be important to determine the cause since some of these other infections have been associated with pregnancy complications and injury to the fetus. It is also important to identify strep throat when present because it requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. (Since EBV is a virus, it cannot be treated with antibiotics.)




","



The mono test is rapid and easy to perform, but it is specific for heterophile antibodies, not EBV. It can also be positive in people with lymphoma, lupus, and some gastrointestinal cancers, although it is not used as a diagnostic or screening tool for these conditions.
When the mono test is negative and/or a healthcare practitioner wants to obtain more information about the presence and status of an EBV infection, the healthcare practitioner may order one or more of a combination of EBV antibodies. These tests can indicate whether a person is susceptible to EBV, has had a recent infection, has had EBV infection in the past, or has a reactivated EBV infection.
Heterophile antibodies decline after the sixth week of illness, and the mono test will become negative as the infection resolves.



",,"



The mononucleosis test is used to help determine whether a person with symptoms has infectious mononucleosis (mono). The test is used to detect proteins in the blood called heterophile antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, the most common cause of mono.
A mono test is frequently ordered along with a complete blood count (CBC). The CBC is used to determine whether the number of white blood cells (WBCs) is elevated and whether a significant number of reactive lymphocytes are present. Mono is characterized by the presence of atypical white blood cells.
If the mono test is initially negative but the healthcare practitioner still suspects mono, a repeat test done a week or so later may be used to determine whether heterophile antibodies have developed. If the mono test is persistently negative, a test specific for EBV antibodies may be used to help confirm or rule out the presence of an EBV infection. A strep test may also be ordered along with a mono test to determine whether a person's sore throat is due to strep throat (group A streptococcal infection) instead of or in addition to mononucleosis.

To determine whether you are a carrier of the bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and could potentially spread it to other people


","

Swab of the nose; occasionally, swab of wound infection site or skin lesion


","



Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are strains of Staphylococcus aureus, or ""staph,"" bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic methicillin as well as to related beta-lactam antibiotics, such as oxacillin, penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalosporins, that are used to treat ordinary staph infections. MRSA testing detects the presence of MRSA in a patient's sample.
Staphylococcus aureus frequently colonizes the human skin and is present in the nose of about a third of U.S. adults. It does not usually cause illness or symptoms. However, if there is a break in someone's skin from a wound or surgery, or if someone's immune system is weakened, then colonizing S. aureus can cause an infection.
Widespread use of antibiotics over the past several decades have led to the development of antibiotic-resistant strains of S. aureus. Infection with these strains can cause skin infections and potentially more severe, life-threatening infections such as pneumonia, bloodstream infections (septicemia), or infections at a surgical site. However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), less than 2% of the population carries the type of staph bacteria known as MRSA. [For more on this, see the article Staph Infections and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.]
MRSA can be spread in healthcare settings and in the community. Contaminated hands, medical equipment, and surfaces in places such as hospitals, clinics, or nursing homes allow the spread of MRSA from colonized or infected patients. In the community, anything that allows for skin-to-skin contact can spread MRSA. This includes sharing personal care items, participating in contact sports, or living or working in close contact with others.
Most hospitals have instituted measures to attempt to eradicate MRSA and to control the spread of MRSA from person to person. Those who test positive for MRSA may be isolated to prevent the spread to others and/or decolonized with a nasal antibiotic ointment and daily cleansing with special antimicrobial wipes. However, exactly how to implement MRSA screening and control in healthcare settings remains somewhat controversial. For example, a 2014 study comparing prevention strategies for bloodstream infections found that treating to eliminate MRSA from intensive care unit (ICU) patients who screen positive was not as effective at reducing these infections as treating all patients admitted to the ICU. This treatment may involve administering antibiotics within the nose and cleansing patients with special antimicrobial wipes. As a result, hospital policies may change in the future and less MRSA screening may be performed in these settings.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A nasal swab is collected by rotating a swab inside each nostril. Occasionally, a swab of a wound infection site or skin lesion is collected.

When you have no signs or symptoms of an active infection, but a healthcare practitioner wants to determine if you are a MRSA carrier, such as when you are hospitalized


","



A MRSA screening test may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner, hospital, or health department needs to evaluate potential MRSA colonization in an individual, their family members, and/or a group of people in the community as the source of a MRSA infection.
Specific populations that have close physical contact, such as a sports team, residents of a nursing home, or healthcare workers, may be tested for MRSA carrier status when an outbreak of MRSA is suspected.
Occasionally, a person who has been treated for MRSA may be screened to determine whether MRSA are still present.



","



If either a culture or a molecular test is positive for MRSA, then the bacteria are present at the site that was tested, such as the nostrils or a wound site.
If the nasal screen or wound site culture is negative, then MRSA are either not present or are present in numbers too low to be detected by the test.



","



Further testing may be performed on MRSA bacteria when they are isolated in a culture. These additional research tests can identify the type and subtype of S. aureus strains. Although the typing may not be used to determine treatment of the patient, it provides information to track the pattern of disease spread of the infection and characterize the toxins and other virulence factors present in the bacteria.



",,"



A methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screen tests solely for the presence of MRSA and no other microbes. It is primarily used to identify the presence of MRSA in a colonized person so they can be treated to eliminate MRSA and prevent its spread to others.
Often, the test is used to screen for MRSA in patients in hospitals, especially in intensive care units. On a community level, MRSA screening may be used to help determine the source of an outbreak. On a national level, additional testing may inform clinicians and researchers about the unique genetic characteristics of the strains of MRSA circulating in the community or healthcare setting. 
MRSA screening tests include:

Bacterial culture - a nasal swab is collected from the nares (nostrils) of an asymptomatic person and cultured (put onto a special nutrient medium, incubated, and then examined for the growth of characteristic MRSA colonies). A swab may be collected from a wound site or skin lesion of a person who has been previously treated for a MRSA infection and cultured similarly. A screening culture identifies the absence or presence of MRSA and usually takes 1 to 2 days for a result.
Molecular tests for MRSA screening can detect nasal or wound carriage within hours, allowing for prompt treatment as necessary. The same specimen types are used in a molecular test, but the specimen is analyzed for the genetic markers to identify S. aureus and the mecA gene that confers resistance to methicillin, oxacillin, nafcillin, dicloxacillin, and other similar antibiotics. Molecular MRSA screening is becoming more widespread.
	 

Some hospitals have instituted measures to control the spread of MRSA by screening those patients they feel are at risk of being colonized with these resistant bacteria (a carrier) or all new admissions to the hospital. When an outbreak of MRSA is under investigation, screening of healthcare workers, family members, and close contacts may be performed to identify the source of the infection and to help devise a plan to contain these infections. In some settings, such as nursing homes, a large number of people may be screened to evaluate the spread of colonization in a specific population.

To evaluate the cause of elevated homocysteine levels; sometimes to help determine your risk of thrombosis or premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), though some expert guidelines do not recommend it


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene contains the DNA code to produce the MTHFR enzyme. This test detects two of the most common mutations.
When there are mutations or variations in the MTHFR gene, it can lead to serious genetic disorders such as homocystinuria, anencephaly, spina bifida, and others. The MTHFR enzyme is critical for metabolizing one form of B vitamin, folate, into another. It is also part of the process that converts homocysteine into methionine, an important building block for many proteins.
If someone has increased levels of homocysteine, that means the body is not processing it properly. One cause of that could be a mutation in the MTHFR gene, causing homocystinuria. While at least seven unique MTHFR mutations have been found in people with homocystnuria, there are two relatively common DNA sequence variants, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that are tested. The two MTHFR variants are called C677T and A1298C, and individuals can inherit one or both variants. These SNPs result in changes in the DNA (or mutations) that are associated with decreased MTHFR activity and increased homocysteine levels in the blood, which may increase the risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), formation of inappropriate blood clots (thrombosis), and stroke.
Approximately 5-14% of the U.S. population is homozygous for C677T, meaning that they have two copies of it. There is some ethnic variability in the frequency, with the highest being in those of Mediterranean ancestry and the lowest in those of African ancestry.
The C677T variant results in a less active form of the MTHFR enzyme and reduced ability to process folate and homocysteine. When a person has two copies of the MTHFR C677T gene mutation (homozygous) or one copy of MTHFR C677T and one copy of A1298C (compound heterozygous), decreased MTHFR enzyme activity slows down the homocysteine-to-methionine conversion process and can lead to a buildup of homocysteine in the blood.
The increase in homocysteine is often mild to moderate but will vary from person to person depending upon the amount of MTHFR enzyme activity. Even if a person has two copies of the MTHFR mutation, that person may not develop high homocysteine levels since adequate folate intake can ""cancel out"" the effect of the MTHFR mutation.
Results of some studies suggest that high levels of homocysteine in the blood may contribute to risk of CVD by damaging blood vessel walls and promoting formation of plaque (atherosclerosis) and inappropriate blood clots. However, a direct link between homocysteine levels and cardiovascular disease or thrombotic risk has not been found. For more on this, see the article on Homocysteine.

When you have elevated homocysteine levels; sometimes when a close relative has MTHFR gene mutations or has developed CVD or thrombosis at an early age


","



The MTHFR mutation test may sometimes be ordered when a person has elevated homocysteine levels, especially when the person has a personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease or thrombosis. It may sometimes be ordered when a close relative has MTHFR gene mutations, although it may not be useful if that relative has normal homocysteine levels, and some laboratories and organizations recommend against using it for thrombophilia screening.
If a person is suspected to have high homocysteine levels, it is recommended to test for homocysteine level rather than MTHFR mutation. In a significant number of cases of homocysteinemia (increase in blood homocysteine level), the MTHFR mutation test is unnecessary.



","



Results typically are reported as negative or positive and, if positive, the report will name the mutation(s) present. Often, an interpretation of the results is also provided.
Only a small percentage of cases of elevated homocysteine are due to an inherited cause. Of these, MTHFR C677T and A1298C mutations are among the most common.
If a person has two copies (homozygous) of MTHFR C677T, or has one copy of C677T and one of A1298C, then it is likely that elevated homocysteine levels are due to these inherited mutations, or that the mutations are contributing to them.
Two copies of A1298C are not typically associated with increased homocysteine levels.
If the MTHFR mutation test is negative, then the C677T and A1298C mutations were not detected and the tested person's elevated homocysteine level is likely due to another cause. Other, more rare MTHFR genetic mutations will not be detected with typical testing.
Those with MTHFR mutations and other clotting risk factors, such as Factor V Leiden or PT 20210 mutations, may be at an increased risk of thrombosis. Research suggests that women with two C677T variants have double the risk of having a child with a neural tube defect, but the risk is far below 1%.



","



People who have elevated homocysteine levels may be at an increased risk of developing premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and/or thrombosis, but many, including those with MTHFR mutations, will never develop CVD or thrombosis. A review of data published in 2012 determined that lifelong moderately elevated homocysteine levels had little to no effect on coronary heart disease.
Besides MTHFR mutations, there are other causes of elevated homocysteine levels, including deficiency of vitamins B6, B12, and/or folate; these vitamins are required for homocysteine metabolism. The MTHFR mutation may not be present with these acquired, as opposed to inherited, causes of elevated homcysteine. Additionally, if a more rare mutation of MTHFR is causing elevated homocysteine levels, the C677T and A1298C tests will not detect those other mutations.
For MTHFR mutations, the C677T variant results in substitution of the amino acid alanine for valine. The A1298C variant results in an alanine substitution (versus a glutamine). The C677T valine substitution results in a less active form of the MTHFR enzyme.
A review of studies published in 2014 supported an association between the MTHFR C677T allele and congenital heart disease in Asian populations and the A1298C allele and CHD in the pediatric Caucasian population.
The MTHFR enzyme is involved in folate metabolism. Because of this, those who have MTHFR mutations and take drugs that affect folate metabolism, such as methotrexate, may be more likely to experience toxicity. An MTHFR mutation test may be performed for a person who is prescribed methotrexate in order to adjust dosages and reduce risk of toxicity.



",,"



The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation test may be used to detect two relatively common mutations in the MTHFR gene that are associated with elevated levels of homocysteine in the blood. It is not routinely ordered.
This test is sometimes ordered as a follow-up to an elevated homocysteine test and may be occasionally ordered along with other cardiac risk tests if a person has a personal or family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) or inappropriate blood clots (thrombosis). However, its utility for assessing risk of CVD has not been established and some expert guidelines do not recommend it for thrombosis screening.
It may be ordered if a person has a close relative with known MTHFR genetic mutations, particularly if that person also has elevated homocysteine levels. MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene mutations are the most common and the ones that are typically tested. If someone has a different mutation in their family, then that specific mutation should be tested.
An MTHFR test may sometimes be ordered along with other inherited clotting risk tests, such as Factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 mutation tests to help evaluate a person's overall risk of developing inappropriate blood clots.
Although the MTHFR mutation test may be used to help determine the cause of elevated homocysteine, the value of measuring homocysteine levels is not clear. While evidence from some studies suggests that elevated homocysteine levels contribute to the risk of CVD and/or thrombosis, a direct link has not been established. Routine testing for homocysteine levels as a cardiac risk marker is not recommended by the American Heart Association. The College of American Pathologists and the American College of Medical Genetics recommend against testing for the C677T variant, citing limited utility for patients with blood clots. Furthermore, use of homocysteine levels for the purpose of determining risk of CVD, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke is in doubt at this time given that several studies show no benefit or risk reduction in people who were treated with folic acid and vitamin B supplements that lowered their homocysteine level.

mycophenolic-acid,"['MPA', 'Mycophenolate Mofetil', 'MMF', 'Mycophenolate Sodium']","

None


","

To determine the concentration of mycophenolic acid (MPA), an immunosuppressant drug, in the blood in order to monitor levels in transplant recipients and prevent toxicity


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate, a drug that is primarily given to people who have had a heart, kidney, or liver transplant to help prevent rejection and secondarily to people with a variety of autoimmune disorders. This test measures the amount of mycophenolic acid in the blood.
Normally, a healthy immune system distinguishes the body's own healthy tissue (self) from threats such as viruses, bacteria, and parasites (non-self). However, the immune system recognizes a transplanted organ as non-self and may attack it. In the case of autoimmune disorders, the immune system mistakenly targets the body's own cells and tissues, causing damage and inflammation.
Mycophenolate belongs to a group of drugs called immunosuppressants that suppress the immune system and helps to prevent organ rejection, tissue inflammation, and damage. Mycophenolate acts by inhibiting formation of an enzyme necessary to produce special immune cells called T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Inhibiting lymphocyte formation decreases both immune system function and antibody production, reducing the body's immune response to transplanted organs or to its own tissues and cells.
Organ transplant recipients receive mycophenolate in conjunction with other immunosuppressant drugs such as cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Autoimmune disorder patients may be prescribed mycophenolate as a single agent, although they may take other medications. It has been used to treat lupus (especially with symptoms of kidney disease), rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohns disease, inflammatory eye diseases including iritis and scleritis, and some other kidney or skin disorders.
Mycophenolate, like most immunosuppressants, must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, then the person may develop toxicity. The mycophenolic acid blood test uses blood samples collected when the drugs are at their lowest, typically just prior to the next dose. Such levels are called trough levels and they are correlated to clinical side effects.

","

As soon as mycophenolate therapy begins and whenever the dose is changed; may be ordered frequently at first, then at regular intervals; whenever excess or deficient levels of MPA are suspected


","



MPA and complete blood count (CBC) tests are ordered frequently at the start of therapy and then at intervals for as long as the person is taking mycophenolate. The MPA test may be performed whenever there is a change in dosage, a change in other medications that the person is taking, or whenever someone has persistent side effects, toxicity, or organ rejection.
The most common side effects include:

Upset stomach or pain
Constipation
Diarrhea
Nausea and/or vomiting
Gas
Sleeplessness (insomnia)
Tremors
Muscle pain
Rash
Headache

Some side effects can be serious. If any of the following become severe or persistent, the person's healthcare provider should be notified, who may wish to check the level of drug:

Swelling of the hands, arms, feet, ankles or lower legs
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
Itching
Fast heartbeat
Dizziness, fainting, lack of energy
Pale skin
Black or tarry stools, blood in stools
Bloody vomit

People older than age 65 may have increased risk for some side effects, particularly infections and gastrointestinal bleeding.



","



An MPA level that is higher than the therapeutic range may cause toxicity. A level that is below the range may lead to rejection of the transplanted organ. Depending on the results, a healthcare practitioner may adjust the dose that the person is given.
Monitoring blood levels can help establish the range in which mycophenolic acid is therapeutic for a particular individual (i.e., individualize therapy). The level at which the person has minimal side effects but is not rejecting the organ is the target range for that person. If other immunosuppressants and/or drugs are added or illnesses occur, the healthcare provider can adjust the dose of mycophenolic acid, if necessary, until the blood level falls within the individualized therapeutic range for this person.



","



Mycophenolic acid levels can be affected by other medications. Drugs that reduce MPA concentrations include antacids containing magnesium or aluminum hydroxide and cholestyramine. Drugs that can increase MPA include ganciclovir, probenecid, and acyclovir. Herbal supplements such as Echinacea, Cats Claw, and St. John's wort should be avoided while taking mycophenolate.
A partial list of medications that may also interfere with mycophenolate includes:

Azathioprine (Imuran)
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim)
Theophylline (Theo-Dur)
Phenytoin (Dilantin)
Aspirin and other salicylates

Oral contraceptives can interfere with MPA, while MPA can decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives and has been linked with first trimester miscarriages and congenital birth defects. Women should not become pregnant while taking mycophenolate and should not breastfeed. Two forms of birth control are recommended as is a pregnancy test prior to the start of the medication. Women who become pregnant should talk to their healthcare practitioner about the associated risks.
Those who are taking mycophenolate should talk to their healthcare provider before getting any vaccines. MPA could increase risk of infection.
People may have side effects and experience complications such as infections and slow healing even when taking mycophenolate properly. Like other immunosuppressant agents, MPA is associated with an increased risk of infection and the development of both lymphoma and skin cancer. People who take MPA should avoid exposure to sunlight and wear protective clothing and sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher) when they are outdoors.



",,"



The mycophenolic acid (MPA) test is ordered to monitor the amount of the drug in the blood over time in organ transplant recipients who are taking the drug to prevent organ rejection. The test is used to determine whether the drug concentration is within the therapeutic range and is below the toxic level. Treatment with MPA is monitored because the range in which the drug is effective but not toxic is very narrow.
A healthcare practitioner may order an MPA test to monitor drug interaction with other immunosuppressants in combination therapy or to correlate with clinical symptoms and side effects. If someone is taking MPA in addition to cyclosporine or tacrolimus, the healthcare practitioner will order both MPA as well as the other immunosuppressant drug tests.

mycoplasma,"['Mycoplasma by PCR', 'Mycoplasma Culture', 'Ureaplasma Culture']","

None


","

To detect an active or recent mycoplasma (type of bacteria) infection


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm, a throat swab, sputum sample, body fluid or tissue sample; occasionally, genital or urethral swab


","



Mycoplasmas are the smallest free-living microbes known. They may exist as part of the normal flora found in the throat, upper respiratory tract, and genitourinary tract. Mycoplasmas are unlike other types of bacteria in many ways and can be difficult to culture and identify. Mycoplasma testing is used to determine whether someone currently has or recently had a mycoplasma infection.
Mycoplasma testing includes a group of tests that either measure antibodies in the blood produced in response to a mycoplasma infection or detect the microbe directly through culturing or by detecting its genetic material (DNA) in a body sample. It is most often used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), the causative agent of respiratory infections often referred to as ""atypical pneumonia.""
M. pneumoniae is a common cause of upper respiratory infections, with an estimated 2 million cases in the U.S. each year. It is responsible for 15-20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, appearing as single cases and as periodic epidemics, especially in school-age children and in military populations or other settings where people live in close quarters. Infections can occur at any time of the year, but outbreaks are more prevalent in the late summer and early fall.
Most cases of M. pneumoniae infection are mild and self-limited, causing nonspecific symptoms such as bronchitis, a runny nose, and a nonproductive cough that may persist for several weeks. Symptoms may become more severe, causing fever, sore throat, headaches, and muscle aches, when the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract and causes ""walking pneumonia,"" or, more rarely, spreads to other parts of the body. This is especially true in very young infants, in those who have underlying health conditions, such as asthma, or who have compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. Depending upon what parts of the body become infected, complications may range from meningitis to difficulty breathing, cardiac inflammation and arrhythmia, skin rashes, lesions or nodules, arthritis, anemia, or to Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Testing may occasionally be done to detect other species of mycoplasma. Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections are less common than those seen with M. pneumoniae. In adults, these organisms are primarily sexually transmitted, causing nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) and some inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) in men and sometimes associated with vaginal discharge and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women. M. hominis and U. urealyticum can be passed from mother to baby during birth when the baby passes through an infected birth canal. They typically colonize infants for their first couple of years. Rarely, they can cause systemic infections in infants and in those with compromised immune systems.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The sample required depends on the method being used and on the health status of the person being tested:

Antibody testing requires a blood sample, obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Direct detection of mycoplasma may be done on a variety of samples. For a respiratory infection, samples may include sputum, a washing of the bronchi in the lungs, or throat swab. If a systemic infection is being diagnosed, blood, joint fluid, body fluids, or tissues samples may be cultured. Some samples may require a special procedure to collect them. To detect a genital infection, a swab of the cervix or urethra may be collected.

","

When your healthcare practitioner suspects that your respiratory or other symptoms are caused by a mycoplasma infection; when a genital infection may be caused by mycoplasma or ureaplasma (a particular type of mycoplasma)


","



M. pneumoniae testing may be ordered when someone has severe respiratory symptoms that are not due to a typical bacterial infection, such as pneumococcal pneumonia. Some of these symptoms may include:

Nonproductive cough that may persist for several weeks
Fever
Sore throat
Headaches and muscle aches

Testing may be done when an infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, causing ""walking pneumonia,"" and/or spreads to other parts of the body and causes complications such as rash, arthritis, encephalitis, inflammation of the heart muscle or the lining that surrounds the heart or hemolytic anemia, and when a person is not responding to standard treatments. It may also be ordered to help track and control the spread of M. pneumoniae infections during an outbreak.
Testing for other species of mycoplasma may be performed, in addition to M. pneumoniae testing, when very young infants and those with compromised immune systems have lung and/or systemic infections or complications that could be due to a mycoplasma infection.
In general, IgM and IgG testing are performed when a health practitioner suspects that a person has an active M. pneumoniae infection, and another IgG test may be performed 2-4 weeks later to document a rise in antibody levels in response to an infection. A M. pneumoniae culture and a DNA test may also be ordered when an active infection is suspected.
Testing of genital samples is not often done because mycoplasmas are frequently part of the normal flora of the genital tract. However, a culture for M. hominis and U. urealyticum may sometimes be ordered when a sexually active male has inflammation of the urethra that is not due to gonorrhea or chlamydia (non-gonococcal urethritis, NGU) or when a female is suspected of having a genital mycoplasma infection, after tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia have come back negative.



","



Antibody testing
Significant concentrations of M. pneumoniae IgM and/or a four-fold increase in IgG levels between the initial sample and the convalescent sample indicate an active or recent M. pneumoniae infection. Increases in IgG, without IgM, can also be seen with a re-infection.
If neither IgM or IgG are present in detectable concentrations, then it means that a person being tested either does not have an active infection, has not had a mycoplasma infection (recent or in the past), or that the person's immune system has not produced antibodies in response to the microbe.
Direct detection
The detection of one of the mycoplasmas or U. urealyticum in a cultured sample may indicate that the person being tested has a mycoplasma infection, particularly if the sample is from a body site that is normally sterile, such as joint fluid or blood. However, if the sample is from the respiratory tract or the genital tract, a positive culture may also mean that the mycoplasma is present as part of their normal flora. For example, U. urealyticum is present in the genital tract of about 60% of healthy women and M. hominis is present in about 20%.
If mycoplasma is not detected in a culture, then it may mean that the person is not infected by that microbe or that the organism was not present in sufficient quantity to be detected in the sample tested.
With DNA testing for M. pneumoniae, if the mycoplasma is present in the sample, then the person may have M. pneumoniae or may be colonized by the organism. If it is not detected, then the person may not have a M. pneumoniae infection or the microbe was present in numbers too low to be detected.



","



Mycoplasma infections often cause symptoms that resemble viral infections. Unlike viruses, they respond to specific antibiotics that treat this type of microbe and decrease the duration of symptoms.
Having a mycoplasma infection does not confer immunity. A person can become re-infected.
Mycoplasmas cannot be seen under the microscope on a gram stain, a test that is often used to help identify bacteria.
An older test called cold agglutinins may sometimes be ordered to help detect a M. pneumoniae infection. It is based on the concept that during an active mycoplasma infection, an antibody is produced in the blood that will cause red blood cells to clump together when cooled. This test is not specific for mycoplasma, but more than half of those with a M. pneumoniae infection will have significant amounts of cold agglutinins.



",,"



Mycoplasma testing is primarily used to help determine if Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the cause of a respiratory tract infection. It may also be used to help diagnose a systemic infection that is thought to be due to mycoplasma.
Blood tests for antibody to M. pneumoniae
Two types of antibodies produced in response to an M. pneumoniae infection may be measured in the blood, IgM and IgG.

IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to infection. Levels of IgM rise for a short time period and then decline, often remaining detectable in the blood for several months.
IgG antibody production follows IgM production, rising over time, and then stabilizing. Once a person has had a mycoplasma infection, they will typically have some measurable amount of mycoplasma IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their life.

In order to diagnose an active M. pneumoniae infection, a health practitioner may order both M. pneumoniae IgM and IgG antibody tests as acute samples and then collect another M. pneumoniae IgG test two to four weeks later as a convalescent sample. This combination of tests is ordered so that the change in the amount of IgG can be evaluated and because some people, especially infants and those with compromised immune systems, may not produce expected amounts of IgG or IgM.
Direct detection
M. pneumoniae detection involves finding the microbe in the respiratory secretions, blood, fluid, or tissue sample. This can be done either by culturing the mycoplasma in a supportive environment or by detecting its genetic material (DNA).
A mycoplasma culture is the traditional method of detection, but it can be challenging and is not always successful. Culturing mycoplasma is more difficult than culturing common bacteria such as staphylococci or streptococci. Mycoplasma lack cell walls and do not grow well on routine bacterial culture media. They lack cell walls and cannot be visualized with a Gram stain as done with most bacteria. Growing mycoplasma involves incubating the patient's sample in a special nutrient media to promote the growth of these microbes, which are slow to grow.
A negative M. pneumoniae culture must be held for 3-4 weeks to confirm that a mycoplasma is not present, compared to 2-4 days for most bacteria. Antibody testing, or sometimes DNA testing, is usually ordered in addition to, or instead of, a M. pneumoniae culture because of this long incubation period before results can be released.
DNA testing is rapid and sensitive but was not routinely offered in many microbiology laboratories because there was not a commercial source for the test. Now there are syndromic panels available that allow the detection of multiple respiratory pathogens that include M. pneumoniae and that will increase the ability of laboratories to test for this microbe. However, the detection of mycoplasma DNA does not confirm a current infection. The presence of mycoplasma DNA may indicate the microbe is colonizing a person or mycoplasma DNA may be detectable after the symptoms of infection have resolved and the organisms are no longer viable.
M. pneumoniae DNA testing may sometimes be ordered, along with other tests, such as testing for Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Legionella species to help distinguish between these organisms as the cause of a respiratory infection.
Occasionally, testing may be used to determine if Mycoplasma hominis, Mycoplasma genitalium, or Ureaplasma urealyticum is the cause of an infection of the genital or urinary tract. M. hominis and U. urealyticum genital samples are typically tested using a culture method that takes several days to recover the microbes, but M. genitalium, which can take 1-2 months to grow, may be more reliably detected with DNA testing.
The choice of tests and body samples collected depends on the age of the person being tested, their general health status and symptoms, and on the healthcare practitioner's clinical findings and suspicions of organ involvement. A person with a suspected mycoplasma infection may be treated based upon clinical findings and imaging studies with or without laboratory testing.

Myoglobin is a small protein found in heart and skeletal muscles that binds oxygen. It traps oxygen within muscle cells, allowing the cells to produce the energy required for muscles to contract. When heart or skeletal muscle is injured, myoglobin is released into the blood. Elevated levels can be measured within a few hours following an injury.
Myoglobin is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and is released into the urine. Large quantities of myoglobin are toxic to the kidneys. If significant amounts of myoglobin are released into the bloodstream, which can happen after severe trauma or muscle injuries, the excess myoglobin may cause damage to the kidneys and eventually result in kidney failure. Measurement of myoglobin in urine helps to detect this condition.

Inflammation of skeletal muscles (myositis)
Heart attack

A significantly elevated level of myoglobin may be caused by rhabdomyolysis (see below).
Myoglobin levels are normally very low or not detectable in the urine. High levels of urine myoglobin indicate an increased risk for kidney damage and failure. Additional tests, such as BUN, creatinine, and urinalysis, are done to monitor kidney function in these people.
Some examples of conditions associated with myoglobin in the urine include:

Excessive physical activity in untrained individuals
Crush injuries and other trauma

Increased myoglobin levels can occur after muscle injections or strenuous exercise. Because the kidneys remove myoglobin from the blood, the myoglobin level may be high in people whose kidneys are failing. Heavy alcohol consumption and certain drugs can also cause muscle injury and increase myoglobin in the blood.
A urine dipstick test for hemoglobin can also be positive in the presence of myoglobin. If the urine dipstick test is positive and myoglobin is suspected to be the cause, it should be followed up with more specific testing for myoglobin.



","



A myoglobin blood test may be used detect muscle damage. When heart or skeletal muscle is injured, myoglobin is released into the blood. Blood levels of myoglobin can rise very quickly with severe muscle damage and can be measured within a few hours following an injury.
Myoglobin is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and is released into the urine. Sometimes, a urine test is used to evaluate myoglobin levels in people who have had extensive damage to their skeletal muscles (rhabdomyolysis). Urine myoglobin levels reflect the degree of muscle injury and, since myoglobin is toxic to the kidneys, reflect the risk of kidney damage.

To detect the presence of and/or measure the quantity of nicotine or its metabolite cotinine in blood, urine, saliva, or sometimes hair; to determine whether someone uses products containing tobacco or nicotine or has been exposed to secondhand smoke; sometimes performed to evaluate for acute nicotine poisoning


","

A blood sample collected from a vein in your arm or a random urine sample; sometimes a saliva sample or, rarely, a hair sample

Nicotine is an addictive chemical found naturally in the tobacco plant and in some manufactured products, such as some e-cigarettes and nicotine-replacement products (e.g., gum, patch). It is inhaled or ingested and subsequently absorbed into the blood. This testing detects and/or measures nicotine and its primary breakdown product (metabolite) cotinine in the blood, urine, saliva, or hair.
Nicotine is metabolized by the liver into more than 20 compounds, which are eliminated from the body in the urine. Both tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke can increase nicotine and cotinine concentrations in the body. Levels also rise with use of nicotine replacement products such as nicotine patches and gums, and with the use of smokeless nicotine vapor (e-cigarettes). In large amounts, nicotine can be poisonous.
Long-term smoking of tobacco products can increase the risk of developing many diseases, including lung cancer, oral cancer, COPD, stroke, heart disease, and respiratory infections. Years of smokeless tobacco use also increases the risk of developing oral cancer (cheeks, gums, and lips). Long-term tobacco use can worsen asthma and help promote blood clot formation. In pregnant women, smoking can impair growth of the developing baby and lead to low birth weight babies.
Cotinine is usually the test of choice to evaluate tobacco use or exposure to tobacco smoke because it is stable and is only produced when nicotine is metabolized. Cotinine has a half-life in the body of between 7 and 40 hours, while nicotine has a half-life of 1 to 4 hours.
Blood and/or urine cotinine tests may be ordered along with nicotine tests. In some cases, other nicotine metabolites, such as nicotine-1'-N-oxide, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, or nornicotine, or other tobacco chemicals, such as anabasine in urine, may also be tested. The presence of anabasine in someone's urine indicates that the person is actively using a tobacco product, as it is not found in commercial nicotine replacement products, such as a patch.
The presence of nicotine and/or cotinine in an individual's sample may indicate the use of tobacco or nicotine products or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Testing may be used in a number of situations to evaluate the possible use of tobacco products, such as in smoking cessation programs, prospective employment assessments, and evaluations of applicants for health or life insurance.
Nicotine and cotinine testing may also be ordered in cases of suspected nicotine poisoning. Acute overdoses of nicotine, such as might happen if a child ingests nicotine lozenges or gum, are relatively rare but generally require immediate medical attention.

Cotinine and/or nicotine testing may be ordered whenever an evaluation of tobacco use status or tobacco smoke exposure is required.
A court may order testing for child custody purposes. When a person enters a smoking cessation program, blood or urine cotinine tests may be ordered to evaluate his or her compliance. Urine, blood, or saliva testing may serve as a screen for tobacco use when someone is applying for life or health insurance.
Nicotine and cotinine are sometimes measured when someone has symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to a nicotine overdose. Symptoms of mild nicotine poisoning may include:

Nausea, vomiting
Dizziness
Drooling
Weakness

More serious nicotine poisoning may result in:

Increased blood pressure and/or heart rate, which suddenly drops
Slowed or difficulty breathing
Abdominal cramps
Agitation, restlessness, or excitement
Burning sensation in mouth
Confusion
Fainting
Headache
Muscular twitching
Seizures, convulsions
Coma

Hair testing is rarely performed in a clinical setting but may be ordered when an evaluation of longer-term tobacco use is desired.



","



Nicotine and/or cotinine results may be reported as positive or negative, or as a level (e.g., nanograms per milliliter or ng/mL).
The level of nicotine and/or metabolites in a person's sample depends on a few factors, such as how much the person inhales or ingests. Also, the rate at which nicotine is metabolized and cotinine is cleared from the body varies from person to person.  
When someone stops using tobacco and nicotine products, it can take more than two weeks for the blood level of cotinine to drop to the level that a non-tobacco user would have and several weeks more for the urine level to decrease to a very low concentration.

In general, a high level of nicotine or cotinine indicates active tobacco or nicotine product use.
A moderate concentration indicates that the person has not had tobacco or nicotine for two to three weeks.
A lower level may be found in a non-tobacco user who has been exposed to environmental smoke.
Very low to non-detectible concentrations may be found in people who have not used tobacco or nicotine and have not been exposed to environmental smoke or in tobacco or nicotine users who have refrained from tobacco and nicotine for several weeks.




","



Test results based on different samples (blood, urine, saliva) are not interchangeable.
Some pesticides contain high concentrations of nicotine. This can be another source of nicotine poisoning. In fact, nicotine is itself a pesticide sometimes used in ""organic"" farming as an alternative to organophosphate or pyrethrinoid derivatives.
Nicotine is found not just in the tobacco plant but also in other plants in the same family. These include potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants, and red peppers. The concentration of nicotine in these plants, however, is much lower than that in tobacco. The cutoffs of the nicotine/cotinine tests have been set to discriminate dietary sources of nicotine from tobacco use and second-hand smoking.
A person's genetic makeup may influence how they metabolize nicotine. Variations in the genes that code for the CYP2A6 and CYP2B6 liver enzymes affect the rate of nicotine metabolism. (For more on this, see our article on Pharmacogenetic Tests.)



",,"



Nicotine, and/or its primary metabolite cotinine, is most often tested to evaluate tobacco use.  Because the use of tobacco products can greatly affect the health of individuals, companies may use nicotine/cotinine testing to evaluate prospective employees for tobacco use. Many health and life insurance companies test applicants for nicotine or cotinine as well.
Nicotine and cotinine can both be measured qualitatively or quantitatively. Qualitative testing detects the presence or absence of the substances, while quantitative testing measures the concentration of the substance. Quantitative testing can help distinguish between active smokers, tobacco users who have recently quit, non-tobacco users who have been exposed to significant environmental tobacco smoke, and non-users who have not been exposed.
Cotinine may also be measured in saliva and in hair, although hair testing is primarily used in a research setting, such as a study of non-smokers exposure to tobacco smoke.
A blood or urine nicotine test may be ordered by itself or along with cotinine if a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone is experiencing a nicotine overdose.
When a person has reported that he or she is using nicotine replacement products but is no longer smoking, nicotine, cotinine, and urine anabasine measurements may sometimes be ordered. Anabasine, an alkaloid, is present in tobacco but not in commercial nicotine replacement products. If a sample tests positive for anabasine, then the person is still using tobacco products.

non-high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol,"['Non-HDL', 'Non-HDL-C']","

For a fasting lipid profile, fasting for 9-12 hours (water only) before having your blood drawn is typically required, but some labs offer non-fasting lipid testing. In particular, testing may be done without fasting for youths without risk factors. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted.

","



Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the total amount of cholesterol contained in lipoproteins other than high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL is a particle that contains cholesterol, which is called HDL cholesterol or HDL-C. Non-HDL-C is calculated from the results of a lipid profile by subtracting the HDL-C result from the total cholesterol.
Lipoproteins are responsible for the transport and metabolism of cholesterol. Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transport cholesterol from the liver to other tissues, including blood vessel walls. Therefore, high LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is considered to be associated with the development of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). High density lipoproteins (HDL) have an inverse function - they transport cholesterol from the blood vessels to the liver, thus providing protection against CVD.
Monitoring and maintaining healthy levels of lipids is important for staying healthy. Eating too much of foods that are high in saturated fats and trans unsaturated fats (trans fats) or having an inherited predisposition can result in a high level of cholesterol in the blood. The extra cholesterol may be deposited in plaques on the walls of blood vessels. Plaques can narrow or eventually block the opening of blood vessels, leading to atherosclerosis and increased risk of numerous health problems, including heart disease and stroke. Additionally, rupture of plaque can cause a heart attack.
In the standard lipid profile, the level of total cholesterol and HDL-C are measured. LDL-C is usually not measured directly but is calculated from the results of the other components of the lipid profile, including total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides. Non-HDL-C may be reported as part of the lipid profile. It reflects the amount of cholesterol in all fractions of lipoproteins that may contribute to your risk of heart disease (atherogenic): LDL, intermediate and very low density lipoproteins (IDL, VLDL) and lipoprotein a (Lp (a)).
How is the sample collected for testing?
The test requires a blood sample taken from a vein in the arm or from a fingerstick.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For a fasting lipid profile, which may include a results for non-HDL-C, fasting for 9-12 hours before having the blood sample drawn is typically required; only water is permitted. However, some laboratories offer non-fasting lipid profiles. In particular, children and teens may have testing done without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and be sure to tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted.

For Screening when no risk factors present: for adults, every four to six years; for youths, once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between ages 17 and 21
For Monitoring: at regular intervals when risk factors are present, when prior results showed high-risk levels, and/or to monitor effectiveness of treatment


","



The calculation of non-HDL-C can be reported as an additional parameter to the traditional lipid profile, along with total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides when a person has a routine health exam.
Adults 
It is recommended that all adults with no risk factors for heart disease be tested every four to six years.
For people who have one or more major risk factors for heart disease (see below), a fasting lipid profile may be ordered more frequently.
Major risk factors for heart disease other than a high LDL-C include:

Cigarette smoking
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Being physically inactive, not getting enough exercise
Age (males 45 years or older or females 55 years or older)
High blood pressure (blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or taking high blood pressure medications)
Family history of premature heart disease (heart disease in a first degree male relative under age 55 or a first degree female relative under age 65)
Pre-existing coronary heart disease or already having had a heart attack
Diabetes or prediabetes
Low HDL-C and/or elevated triglycerides

Youth 
For children and teens, routine lipid testing is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics once between the ages of 9 and 11 and again between the ages of 17 and 21. Earlier and more frequent screening with a lipid profile is recommended for children and youth who are at increased risk of developing heart disease and who have a family history of elevated cholesterol. Some of the risk factors are similar to those in adults and include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight. High-risk children should have their first lipid profile between 2 and 8 years of age. Children younger than 2 years old are too young to be tested.
Non-HDL-C can also be reported along with a lipid profile periodically in order to assess the treatment of lipid disorders, both with diet, increased physical activity and after drug therapy, such as statins. Non-HDL-C is considered to be the second target, after LDL-C, of lipid-lowering therapy.



","



In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. A healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of non-HDL-C and the other components of a lipid profile as well as other risk factors to help determine a person's overall risk of heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower the person's risk.
Adults
In 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) provided guidelines for evaluating lipid levels and determining treatment. However, in 2013, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) issued guidelines for adults that made recommendations on who should receive cholesterol-lowing therapy, depending on age, presence of heart disease and/or diabetes, and LDL-C level.
In healthy adults with no heart disease, the decision to treat is based on a risk calculator that takes into account several factors (e.g., age, gender, race, blood pressure, cholesterol level) and determines the risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. A person with a 7.5% or higher risk should be prescribed statins, according to the ACC/AHA guidelines. Recent guidelines also recommend focusing on a percentage reduction in LDL-C rather than target values to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
However, use of the updated risk calculator and guidelines remains controversial. Many still use the older guidelines from the NCEP ATP III to evaluate lipid levels and heart disease risk. According to the NCEP, if a person has no other risk factors, a non-HDL level can be evaluated as follows:



Optimal:
Less than 130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L)


Near/above optimal:
130-159 mg/dL (3.37-4.12mmol/L)


Borderline high:
160-189 mg/dL (4.15-4.90 mmol/L)


High:
190-219 mg/dL (4.9-5.7 mmol/L)


Very high:
Greater than 220 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L)
			 



Youths
A full, fasting lipid profile is recommended for screening youths with risk factors for developing heart disease, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Fasting prior to lipid screening in children without risk factors is unnecessary. Non-HDL-C is the recommended test for non-fasting lipid screening. Recommended cut-off values include:

Children and Teens
Total Cholesterol
Less than 170 mg/dL (4.40 mmol/L)
170-199 mg/dL (4.40-5.14 mmol/L)
Greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (5.17 mmol/L)


 
Non-HDL Cholesterol
Less than 120 mg/dL (3.11 mmol/L)
120-144 mg/dL (3.11-3.73 mmol/L)
Greater than or equal to 145 mg/dL (3.76 mmol/L)


Young Adults
Total Cholesterol
Less than 190 mg/dL (4.91 mmol/L)
190-224 mg/dL (4.91-5.79 mmol/L)
Greater than or equal to 225 mg/dL (5.81 mmol/L)


 
Non-HDL Cholesterol
Less than 150 mg/dL (3.89 mmol/L)
150-189 mg/dL (3.89-4.90 mmol/L)
Greater than or equal to 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L)



Low levels of non-HDL-C, as well as LDL-C, are not usually a cause for concern and do not require monitoring. This state might occur in hyperthyroidism, liver diseases or inherited deficiency of lipoproteins.



","



Since non-HDL-C is a calculated parameter, the measurement of total cholesterol and HDL-C must be performed first.
The concentration of non-HDL-C, like LDL-C, may temporarily decrease due to acute infections, myocardial infarction or injury. Higher concentrations can be observed in pregnant women. Accordingly, the assay should be performed in relatively healthy patients. Otherwise, the determination should be done about 6 weeks after disease or giving birth.



",,"



Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) may be calculated and reported as part of a lipid profile to help determine an individual's risk of heart disease. Results of non-HDL-C and other components of the lipid profile may be considered along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up if there is intermediate or high risk. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes such as diet or exercise programs or lipid-lowering drugs such as statins. The components of the lipid profile may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment once it is initiated.

For pregnant women, to assess the risk of your developing baby (fetus) having certain chromosome disorders


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in the mother's arm


","



Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) helps determine the risk that a pregnant woman's developing baby (fetus) has a chromosome disorder. It is not a diagnostic test, meaning it cannot tell for certain whether your baby is affected or unaffected. If NIPS shows an increased risk for a specific chromosome disorder, diagnostic testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis is recommended to establish the true diagnosis.
NIPS evaluates a type of genetic material called cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that is released by cells from the placenta and circulates in the mother's blood during pregnancy. The cfDNA from the placenta generally reflects the genetic makeup of the developing baby (fetus). NIPS detects chromosome disorders in placental cfDNA and can be performed as early as the 10th week of pregnancy.
Although there are many similarities among various versions of NIPS, laboratories may offer opt-in or opt-out choices for things like the sex chromosomes or microdeletions. It is important to speak to your healthcare practitioner about which test is being recommended for you. NIPS may screen for:

The presence of extra chromosomes (trisomies) such as:
	
Down syndrome (trisomy 21)—Down syndrome is the most common of the three trisomies screened for by NIPS. While all individuals with Down syndrome share certain characteristics, the severity of these characteristics can vary quite broadly.
Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) are both less common than Down syndrome and typically much more severe. Many babies with Edwards or Patau syndrome do not survive to the first year.


Sex chromosome disorders—some people elect to have the sex chromosomes screened to learn the anticipated sex of their baby, but there are also sex chromosome disorders, such as Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome and XXX syndrome that may be identified. For additional information on sex chromosome abnormalities (SCAs), please see the links in the Related Content section.
Microdeletion syndromes—although not recommended by professional guidelines, some laboratories also offer screening for a set of disorders caused by small missing segments of specific chromosomes, called microdeletion syndromes. When chromosomal segments are missing, differences in the amount of chromosomal information present alter the baby's development and cause the features of these disorders. With the exception of DiGeorge syndrome (also called deletion 22q11.2 syndrome), the other conditions are quite rare, and the test's ability to correctly identify microdeletions is unclear.

During or after the 10th week of pregnancy


","



The non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) can be offered during or after the tenth week of pregnancy. Samples collected prior to this time are automatically rejected, so it is important to be certain that the pregnancy is at a minimum of 10 weeks along.



","



Results may be reported as ""low risk"" (negative) or ""high risk"" (positive).
A NIPS result that is reported as ""negative"" or as ""low risk"" means that it is unlikely the baby has any of the specific chromosome disorders that were screened. Most NIPS tests evaluate the risk for Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18) and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), but depending on how your healthcare practitioner ordered the test, it may also include the sex chromosomes (X and Y) and certain microdeletion syndromes.
It is important to remember that NIPS is a screening test, not a diagnostic test, so it is possible that the baby actually has a chromosomal disorder, even though the screening results show low risk (a false-negative result). In addition, NIPS does not screen every chromosome and does not detect the many genetic disorders that are caused by smaller changes in DNA. This means that other chromosome abnormalities or genetic disorders could be present and would not be identified by NIPS.
A NIPS result that is reported as ""positive"" or ""increased/high risk"" means that the baby is at an increased risk of having the abnormality identified. It is important to note that, while the test's ability to correctly identify pregnancies at increased risk of Down syndrome is high, it is not as good at correctly identifying abnormalities of other chromosomes, including 18, 13 and X. It is important to remember that NIPS is a screening test and not a diagnostic test, so it is possible that the baby actually does not have the disorder indicated (false-positive result).
Diagnostic testing can be performed with either chorionic villus sampling (CVS), which samples placental tissue, between the 10th and 13th week of pregnancy, or amniocentesis (amnio), which samples amniotic fluid, after about 16 weeks of pregnancy. Chromosomal analysis by karyotyping or chromosomal microarray is performed on the sample to rule out or confirm a suspected chromosome disorder.
In some cases, the laboratory that performs the NIPS testing will return an ""indeterminate"" or ""no call"" result when there is an insufficient amount of cfDNA from the placenta in the mother’s blood sample. There are a number of factors that may affect this measurement, such as the gestational age, the presence of multiple fetuses (e.g., twins) and the mother's weight. Obese women tend to have a lower concentration of placental cfDNA in their bloodstream.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) recommend that women with a ""no call"" result be offered diagnostic testing using CVS or amniocentesis rather than repeating the NIPS testing (unless the sample was accidentally collected too early in the pregnancy). For mothers who are obese, their healthcare practitioner may offer a prenatal screen that is less affected by maternal weight than NIPS.
There are different versions of NIPS offered by different laboratories. Healthcare practitioners should be prepared to offer pre- and post-test genetic counseling for the version of NIPS that are chosen for their patients. If there are additional questions about result interpretation, a referral to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and/or genetic counselor is appropriate.

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) may be used to assess the risk of a pregnant woman's developing baby (fetus) having a chromosome disorder, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), or Patau syndrome (trisomy 13). It may also be used to identify sex chromosome abnormalities (changes to the number of X or Y chromosomes present). Some laboratories offer additional testing for conditions caused by small segments of missing information on specific chromosomes, called microdeletion syndromes.
You should discuss this and other screening options with your healthcare practitioner to ensure it is the best choice for you. If you are not certain which prenatal screening or diagnostic test is right for you, it may be a good idea to speak with a genetic counselor.

opioid-testing,,"

Prior to testing, you should declare any prescription or over-the-counter medications or supplements that you are taking so that test results will be correctly interpreted. Certain prescription and over-the-counter medications may give positive opioid results. These include quinolone antibiotics and the antibiotic rifampin. Verapamil, quetiapine, diphenhydramine, and doxylamine have been reported to give false-positive results for methadone testing.
Consumption of poppy seed-containing foods is well known to produce a positive result for opiates and poppy seeds should be avoided prior to testing when possible.
If your saliva is to be collected for testing, you typically should not put anything in your mouth for the 10 minutes prior to the collection of the sample. You should follow the directions provided with the sample container.

To monitor compliance with prescribed medications
To screen for opioid abuse or drug diversion (when a person gives, trades, or sells the prescription to another individual)
To monitor someone with an opioid addiction
To detect and evaluate opioid overdose



","


Urine is the most frequently tested sample for opioids. Urine is collected in a clean container.
Alternatively, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm and drawing blood into a tube.
Hair may be tested and is usually collected from the crown of the head, although hair may also be collected from other locations, such as the chest or underarm.
Saliva is collected in an absorbent pad or swab placed between the lower cheek and gums for a few minutes.
A sweat sample is collected with a patch that may be worn for several days.



","



Opioids are a class of drugs that are used to reduce pain (narcotic analgesics). Opioid testing is used to confirm the presence of opioids in the urine, blood, saliva, hair, or sweat.
Opioids include opiates that are derived from natural sources (e.g., heroin and morphine) and semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone and fentanyl). Testing methods may detect only a few opiates or may include testing for a large number of specific opioids.
Opioid tests may be ordered for medical reasons, for example, to determine compliance with opioid prescription medications, to determine adherence to a chemical dependency rehabilitation program, or for legal reasons, for example, as part of a court-ordered probation requirement.
Opioid addiction is currently an epidemic and is considered a public health emergency in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose deaths have quadrupled since 1999. To combat opioid addiction, the CDC's 2016 guidelines on prescribing opioids for chronic pain include annual urine testing to monitor patients for signs of opioid misuse and/or diversion. Most medical guidelines recommend that patients prescribed opioids for longer than 90 days be urine drug tested at least annually and prior to starting therapy.
People who use opioids may ingest, inhale, smoke, or inject them. The effect of an opioid depends on the particular opioid used, the amount used, its purity, and the method of use, such as whether it is taken in tablet form or injected.
To test for opioids, healthcare practitioners may send urine samples to a laboratory for screening or they may perform a test in their office. Testing may be performed as point-of-care tests, which are typically small strips that are dipped into the urine and interpreted by the appearance of a colored line on the strip. Most tests will detect the drug in urine if someone has taken an opioid in the previous 1 to 3 days, but this timeframe depends on the specific opioid consumed and the individual's ability to metabolize the drug.
Some opioids may be difficult to detect with the routine screening tests because the test may not be designed to detect the specific drug of interest. Healthcare practitioners may identify which opioid they want to detect when they order the test. Often, laboratories will offer a pre-determined panel test that will include several individual screens that target commonly prescribed opioids. The following table lists some examples of opioids or opioid metabolites that may be tested.



Opioid Type
Examples


Opiates (from natural sources)
Codeine, morphine, heroin and heroin metabolite (6-monoacetylmorphine)


Semi-synthetic opioids
Hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone


Synthetic opioids
Fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, meperidine, methadone, propoxyphene, tramadol, tapentadol


Other drugs loosely referred to as opioids (antagonists and agonist/antagonist)
Buprenorphine, naloxone, naltrexone



Positive screening tests are presumptive. This is because some screening tests have the potential for false-positive results. Therefore, screening tests that are positive are often confirmed with a second test that identifies the exact substance that is present. Confirmatory tests are usually more sensitive than screening tests and will detect lower levels of specific opioids. Confirmatory testing is usually performed with an instrument called a mass spectrometer. Types of mass spectrometry tests used for confirmatory testing include gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
Both screening and confirmatory tests are interpreted based on a cut-off. If a drug is not present, or if the drug is present at a concentration below the test cut-off, the test will be reported as ""undetected,"" ""absent"" or ""negative."" If a drug is present at a concentration equal to or above the cutoff, the test will be reported as ""detected,"" ""present"" or ""positive.""
Testing may also be performed to identify whether anything has been added to the urine sample, such as water, bleach or other types of chemicals (adulterants) that may have been added in an attempt to interfere with the test. If adulteration is suspected, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.
Urine samples may also be identified as dilute. Dilute urine may be produced if an individual consumes large amounts of water or other liquids prior to testing. Dilute urine may also result from some medical conditions. If an individual adds liquid such as water to a urine sample, this may also cause dilute urine. It may not always be possible to determine how the urine was diluted. If the urine is so dilute that the results are not reliable, the test may be reported as invalid or adulterated.

Monitoring Pain Medication Use
Opioid testing may be ordered by a health practitioner when a person is prescribed opioids for more than 90 days for pain in order to determine whether the person is taking the prescribed opioids and make sure the person is not taking any additional non-prescribed opioids or illicit drugs.
Medical Screening
Opioid testing may also be ordered by a health practitioner when a person is known or suspected of substance abuse or when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest opioid use or withdrawal. These symptoms may affect an individual's mood, behavior and physical state in the following ways:

Dilated or small pupils

Slow or slurred speech
Agitation
Nausea
Difficulty breathing
Delirium
Seizures
Changes in blood pressure or heart rhythm

Symptoms associated with opioid abuse and overdose may vary from person to person and cannot be determined strictly from dose.

Forensic opioid testing is performed when an employer or legal entity needs to determine if a person may have taken non-prescribed opioids. Testing may be ordered prior to the start of some new jobs and insurance policies and at random to satisfy workplace, court-ordered monitoring, or probation requirements.



","



A positive or detected initial drug screening means that the person tested may have taken an opioid. Screening tests are not definitive, and confirmatory testing may be ordered to confirm the screening test result.
Drug testing of urine cannot be used to determine when or how much drug was consumed, nor can testing prove what influence the drug is having on the person tested.
A negative result does not necessarily mean that the person did not take an opioid. The drug may be present but below the established cutoff, the drug may have been already metabolized and eliminated from the body, or the testing method may not detect the particular drug that is present in the sample.
Tests of different body samples reveal drug use within varying windows of time. For example:

Urine testing shows drug use over the last 1 to 3 days for opioids, depending on the specific drug. Certain opioids may be detectable for less than 1 day after use, and some opioids will be detected for longer than 3 days after last use. This time frame will depend on the specific test cutoff used too.
Blood testing will identify the level of drug that is present in the blood. Drugs are detected for a shorter amount of time in blood compared to urine.
Hair samples, which test the root end of the hair, typically cover drug use within the last 90 days. This average window may vary based on an individual's hair growth rate and other factors.
Saliva testing shows opioid use ranging from within the last few hours up to 50 hours, depending on the drug.
Samples of sweat may be collected on an absorbent patch worn for several days and positive results may indicate opioid use at any point during sweat collection.




","



Elements of a urine drug screen may include testing to ensure the sample is valid and that the urine sample and has not been tampered with or otherwise adulterated. This testing may include a visual inspection of the urine, a temperature check of urine immediately after collection, measurement of urine creatinine, urine specific gravity (urine concentration), and urine pH. Urine may also be tested for oxidants, nitrite, glutaraldehyde, or other possible adulterants.
Urine collection rooms may be altered to prevent tampering of the sample, including absence of hot or running water or the addition of blue coloring in the toilet water. In some workplace drug testing programs, observed re-collection may be requested when there is high suspicion of cheating. Some states and cities prohibit observed collections for workplace drug testing. Federal laws may supersede state laws for federally-regulated testing.
For some types of testing, such as workplace testing of federal employees, there are many regulations that cover the testing process, from collection through interpretation and reporting of results. It is important for the ordering physician, law enforcement representative, forensic professional, government entity, insurance agent, employer, and sports organization as well as for the person being tested to understand what exactly is included in the testing, how testing is performed, and how the results are interpreted, including whether the individual was given any medically necessary drugs prior to the test. This process is not nearly as simple or straightforward as collecting a sample and requesting ""drug testing.""



","



Opioid testing is used to detect the presence of one or more opioids in urine, saliva, blood or hair.
Opioid testing may be used for:
Monitoring Pain Medication Use
Opioid testing of urine is used to monitor adherence of patients to prescribed opioids for chronic pain. A health practitioner may periodically order a full drug testing panel to ensure that a patient is taking the prescribed opioid and to check that the patient is not taking any other non-prescribed opioids or other illegal substances.
Urine drug screening is recommended by the CDC and other medical organizations in order to confirm patient adherence with prescription opioids in combination with other screening tools, such as pill counts or prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). The purpose is to minimize risks associated with prescribing opioids.
Medical Screening
Medical screening for opioids is used to determine what drugs or combination of drugs a person may have taken or been exposed to so that the person can receive proper medical treatment. A drug's overall effect on an individual may depend on how that person's body responds to the drug, how often the individual is exposed to the drug, on the quantity of the drug taken, and whether the drug is taken in combination with other drugs.
A health practitioner may order drug testing for medical reasons if an individual:

Experiences symptoms that may be drug-related or shows signs of intoxication, such as unconsciousness, nausea, delirium, panic, paranoia, increased temperature, chest pain, respiratory failure, seizures, and/or headaches
Is involved in an accident that an emergency room physician suspects may be due to drug intoxication
Is suspected of drug use or is known to use legal and/or illegal drugs
Is being treated in an addiction recovery or chemical dependency program

For a more in-depth discussion of this, see the article Emergency and Overdose Drug Testing.
Legal or Forensic Testing
Drug testing for legal purposes or forensic testing differs from clinical testing primarily in sample collection procedures. Sample collection for forensic testing is strictly controlled, with the custody of a sample continuously documented to maintain a legal ""chain-of-custody."" After a sample is provided, it is closed and secured with a tamperproof seal. A custody and control form accompanies the sample throughout all handling, testing, and storage. This creates a continuous record for the sample and links it to the person who is being tested.
Examples of this type of testing include:

Court-mandated testing for someone who has been convicted of illegal drug use
Testing or monitoring of a parent in a custody case
Forensic toxicology testing using a variety of body fluids and tissues that may be tested during a crime investigation; the goal may be to determine whether opioids were a contributing factor to an accident or crime, such as DUI (driving under the influence). Testing may also determine whether someone died of a drug overdose or drug-related condition.
Applicants for life insurance policies may undergo general drug screening, possibly including tests for opioids.
Some athletic programs may test for opioids as part of a general toxicology screen to detect drug abuse in athletes.

For additional information on this type of testing, see the article on The World of Forensic Laboratory Testing.
Employment Drug Testing 
Opioid testing may be part of a job requirement. This is also referred to as ""workplace drug testing,"" a specific type of forensic testing (see above). It may be done prior to employment, on a random basis, following an accident, or if an employer has a reasonable suspicion that an employee is using illegal drugs. Employment drug testing is not uncommon. It is required for employees of the U.S. Department of Transportation, military personnel, and other federal employees, and is an accepted practice in many other industries.
As with legal or forensic drug testing, the sample collection and testing procedures for employment drug testing are often strictly controlled and documented to maintain a legal ""chain-of-custody."" Test results are also reviewed by a specially trained and licensed physician called a medical review officer prior to reporting.

Primarily, to detect poisoning due to ingestion of toxins such as methanol or ethylene glycol; to help evaluate the body's water and electrolyte balance; to investigate low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia) 


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; sometimes a random urine sample is collected


","



Osmolality is a measure of the number of dissolved particles in a fluid. A test for osmolality measures the amount of dissolved substances such as sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, and urea in a sample of blood and sometimes in urine. Alternatively, it can be estimated from the major solutes expected to be in the blood or urine.
Water balance in the body is a dynamic process that is regulated by controlling the amount of water eliminated in the urine by the kidneys and by increasing or decreasing water drinking by regulating ""thirst."" In a healthy person, the body perceives and reacts to changes in the amount of water and particles in the blood.

When blood osmolality increases with a decrease in the amount of water in the blood or an increase in the number of particles such as sodium, chloride, and glucose, a gland called the hypothalamus releases antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The kidneys respond to ADH by conserving water and producing urine that is more concentrated. The retained water dilutes the blood and lowers blood osmolality back to normal. This also increases blood volume and blood pressure. If this is not sufficient to restore the water balance, then thirst is also stimulated so that the affected person will drink more water.
When blood osmolality decreases, the release of ADH is suppressed, the kidneys release more dilute urine, the amount of water in the body decreases, thirst is diminished, and blood osmolality increases back toward normal.

A blood (serum) osmolality test is primarily a measure of sodium dissolved in the serum (the liquid portion of blood). Sodium is the major electrolyte in the blood and urine. It works with potassium, chloride, and CO2 (in the form of bicarbonate) to maintain electrical neutrality in the body and acid-base balance. Sodium comes into the body in the diet and is normally conserved or eliminated in the urine by the kidneys to maintain its concentration in the blood within a healthy range.
In addition to electrolytes, glucose and urea contribute to osmolality. Normally their contributions are small, but when someone has high blood glucose (hyperglycemia, as found in untreated diabetes) or high blood urea (seen in diseases such as kidney failure), their influence can be significant.
Serum osmolality is often used in cases of suspected poisoning or overdose. Toxins such as methanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, and acetone, and drugs such as salicylates (aspirin) can also affect osmolality when ingested in sufficiently large amounts.
A urine osmolality test primarily measures the waste products urea and creatinine. Urea and creatinine are produced and removed by the body at a relatively constant rate.
A serum osmolal gap (osmotic gap) may also be calculated. It is the difference between measured and calculated (estimated) osmolality results. In order to calculate the osmolal gap, tests for blood sodium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and glucose must be performed to calculate the expected osmolality. Some versions of the expected osmolality calculation also include the measurement of ethanol. An increase in the osmolal gap (greater than 10) indicates the presence of substances such as toxins, aspirin (salicylates), or mannitol.

When you may have ingested methanol, ethylene glycol, or isopropyl alcohol; when you have a low blood sodium level 
 


","



This test may be ordered when it is suspected that someone has ingested a toxin such as methanol or ethylene glycol.
Testing may be ordered when a person has an unexplained low blood sodium or signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to low blood sodium such as:

Excessive thirst
Confusion
Nausea
Headache
Lethargy
In severe cases, seizures or coma
	 

A urine osmolality test may be ordered along with blood testing when a health practitioner wants to compare urine results with the serum osmolality and/or when the person being tested is producing increased or decreased amounts of urine.



","



Osmolality is dynamic and will fluctuate as the body responds to and corrects temporary water imbalances. Serum and urine osmolality tests must be evaluated in the context of the person's signs and symptoms and along with the findings of other tests, such as sodium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Osmolality results are not diagnostic; they suggest that a person has an imbalance, but they do not pinpoint the cause.
In general, increased serum osmolality may be due to either decreased water in the blood or increased solutes. Examples of conditions in which blood (serum) osmolality may be increased include:

Toxic ingestion of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol or aspirin (salicylates), for example
Dehydration
Diabetes
Increase blood glucose
Increased blood sodium
Increased nitrogen waste products in the blood (uremia)
Stroke or head trauma that leads to decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
Kidney damage and disease
Mannitol therapy--used in the treatment of brain swelling (cerebral edema)
Shock
	 

In general, a decreased serum osmolality may be due to increased fluids. Examples of conditions causing decreased blood osmolality include:

Excess hydration (drinking excessive amounts of water, water retention or decreased ability of the kidneys to produce urine)
Decreased blood sodium
Increased ADH secretion
	 

Osmolal gap 
A serum osmolal gap of greater than 10 is considered abnormal and indicates the presence of an osmotically active substance in the blood. When someone has an increased osmolal gap, a toxic ingestion, such as methanol, is suspected, and the size of the gap is proportional to the amount of toxin. Other common causes of an elevated osmolal gap are alcoholic ketoacidosis, kidney failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, and shock. During monitoring of treatment, the osmolal gap, and findings such as a low sodium level, return to normal.
Urine osmolality
Urine osmolality is often evaluated in the context of how much urine the person is producing. Increased amounts of urine may be due to increased fluid intake, lack of appropriate amounts of ADH, or diabetes, with increased glucose levels leading to increased urine output. Decreased amounts of urine may be due to a variety of causes, including decreased blood flow to the kidneys, an appropriate response to dehydration, or damage to tubular cells in the kidneys.

When a person produces increased amounts of urine and urine osmolality is low, then the person either is ridding their body of excess fluids or is unable to concentrate urine appropriately.
Increased amounts of urine and a high osmolality may be seen when there is a substance being flushed from the body, such as excess glucose with diabetes.
If a person produces decreased amounts of urine and has high urine osmolality, then the person may be dehydrated
If someone produces decreased amounts of urine and has low or normal urine osmolality, the person may have kidney damage.
	 

Examples of conditions that can cause increased urine osmolality include:

Dehydration
Congestive heart failure
Increased sodium
Inappropriate ADH secretion
Adrenal insufficiency/Addison's disease
Liver damage
Shock
Glucose in the urine (from uncontrolled diabetes)
	 

Examples of conditions that can cause decreased urine osmolality include:

Diabetes insipidus
Drinking excess fluids
Increased blood calcium
Decreased blood potassium
Kidney disease or kidney failure

The blood osmolality test is primarily used to help determine whether a person has ingested a toxin such as methanol or ethylene glycol (antifreeze). Sometimes it may be used to investigate low blood sodium and your body’s water balance. Osmolality may be measured directly or estimated using a calculation.
In addition to osmolality, the osmolal gap (osmotic gap) may be calculated and used to detect and/or measure toxins in the blood, such as methanol, ethylene glycol, isopropyl alcohol, and propylene glycol.
Urine osmolality may be used along with serum osmolality to help evaluate the body's water balance and to investigate increased and decreased urination. Urine sodium and creatinine are often ordered along with urine osmolality. Sometimes a urine osmolal gap is calculated and used to help evaluate the kidney's ability to eliminate acid and reabsorb bicarbonate, to detect the presence of osmotically active molecules, and to compare with the serum osmolal gap.

","

To determine whether you have a parasite infecting your digestive tract


","

A fresh stool sample transported to the lab within 2 hours or a preserved stool sample; usually multiple samples are collected on different days.


","



An ova and parasite (O&P) exam is a test in which a laboratory professional uses a microscope to examine a stool sample and look for parasites. A variety of parasites can cause infections of the digestive system (gastrointestinal (GI) infections). When you have a parasite infecting your lower digestive tract, causing symptoms such as diarrhea, the parasites and their eggs (ova) are shed from your lower digestive tract into your stool.
For the exam, thin smears of your fresh or preserved stool are put onto glass slides and stained. The parasites and/or their ova or cysts (the form in which the parasite is surrounded by a resistant cover or capsule) may be seen and identified using a microscope. Different ova and parasites have distinct shapes, sizes, and internal structures that are characteristic of their species.
There are a wide variety of parasites that can infect humans. Each type of parasite has a specific life cycle and maturation process and may live in one or more hosts. Some parasites spend part of their life in an intermediate host, such as a sheep, before infecting humans. Some infect humans ""by accident."" There are parasites that are a single cell while others are worms (helminths). Most parasites have more than one form through which they develop. Many have a mature form and a cyst and/or egg (ova) form. Some also have a larval phase, which is between the egg and the mature form. Ova are hardy and can exist for some time in the environment without living in a host and remain infectious.
Most people who are infected by gastrointestinal parasites become infected by drinking water or eating food that has been contaminated with the ova. (For more details, read Food and Waterborne Illness.) Ova and parasites from infected people or animals are released in the stool and can then contaminate any water, food, or surfaces that come into contact with them. This contamination cannot be seen. The food and water will look, smell, and taste completely normal. If you eat contaminated food or drink contaminated water, you can become infected. Without careful sanitation (hand washing and care with food preparation), you can pass the infection to others.
The most common symptoms of a parasitic infection are prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, mucus in your stool, abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms typically arise days to weeks after infection and can continue for some time. You may also have headaches and fever, or few or no noticeable symptoms.
If your diarrhea lasts more than a few days, it may lead to weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. These complications are especially dangerous in children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems (e.g., people with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and transplant recipients). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), foodborne and waterborne diarrheal diseases, including those caused by parasites, kill more than 700,000 people a year.
The three most common parasites in the United States are the single-cell parasites Giardia species, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium species. These parasites may infect swimming pools, hot tubs, and occasionally community water supplies and can be found throughout the world in even the most remote and pristine mountain streams and lakes.

Giardia species are some of the most common intestinal parasites in the U.S.
Cryptosporidium (often called crypto) is one of the leading causes of recreational water-related disease outbreaks in the U.S.
Entamoeba histolytica is common but only causes illness in about 10% to 20% of those infected.

In many cases, Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts can survive in water for weeks or months and are resistant to low levels of chlorine. The number of those infected with these parasites tends to increase during the summer months when more people are pursuing outdoor activities such as backpacking, hiking, and swimming and they drink untreated water or contaminated food.
If you travel outside the U.S., especially to resource-limited nations, you may be exposed to a much wider variety of parasites. In warm climates and places where water and sewage treatment are less effective, parasites are more prevalent. Besides Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and E. histolytica, there are also a wide range of flat worms, roundworms, hookworms, and flukes that can affect the digestive tract and other parts of the body. As a visitor, you would usually become infected by eating or drinking something that has been contaminated with the parasites' ova, even something as simple as ice cubes in a drink or a fresh salad, but some of the tiny worm-like parasites can also penetrate the skin, such as through the skin of your foot when you are walking barefoot.
If your illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, your healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if your symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in your stool, or if it persists, then a stool culture may be ordered. This is especially true if you have been outside the U.S. and/or have eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to you ill.
To aid diagnosis, an ova and parasite exam may be done along with or following a GI pathogens panel that simultaneously tests for multiple disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Other tests that may be done include a stool culture and antigen tests to identify specific microbes.
How is the sample collected for testing?
You collect a fresh stool sample in a clean container provided by the laboratory or your healthcare practitioner. The stool sample should not be contaminated with urine or water. Once it has been collected, your stool should either be taken to the laboratory within two hours after collection or transferred into special transport vials containing preservative solutions.
Often, multiple samples are collected and tested. These should be collected at different times on different days because parasites are shed periodically and may not be in your stool at all times. Multiple samples can increase the likelihood that parasites will be detected.

Prolonged diarrhea
Abdominal pain, cramping
Nausea, vomiting

","



Results are typically reported as negative or positive.
A negative result means there were no ova or parasites seen and your diarrhea may be due to another cause. However, there may also be too few parasites to detect in the sample tested. A healthcare practitioner may order additional O&P tests to confirm this finding and/or may order other tests to search for the cause of your persistent symptoms.
A positive result means you have a parasite infecting your digestive tract. The ova and parasites present in your stool samples are identified and counted. Numbers may range from many to very few or rare.
Typically you will only have one type of parasite that is causing your symptoms, but there could be more than one. The most common and frequently detected parasites in the U.S. are:

Giardia species—some of the most common intestinal parasites in the United States.
Cryptosporidium (often called crypto)—one of the leading causes of recreational water-related disease outbreaks in the U.S.
Entamoeba histolytica—common but only causes illness in about 10% to 20% of those infected.

Some examples of other intestinal parasites that may be detected with an O&P include the following.
Single cell parasites:

Dientamoeba fragilis
Balantidium coli
Cyclospora cayetanensis

Worms (helminths):

Roundworms such as Ascaris, Strongyloides
Hookworms
Tapeworms such as Hymenolepis nana, Taenia solium and Diphyllobthrium latum
Flatworms and flukes such as Fasciolopsis buski

The ova and parasite (O&P) exam is used to detect the presence of parasites in your stool sample and help diagnose an infection of the digestive system (gastrointestinal, GI tract). Since there are many causes of GI infections, an O&P may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens panel or a stool culture, to help establish your diagnosis.
Many GI infections in the U.S. resolve with no specific treatment, with only supportive care, and may not require testing. If you are otherwise healthy, the infections are considered common illnesses that are not serious and sometimes thought of as ""food poisoning"" or ""stomach flu."" However, there are cases where it is useful to perform testing that identifies the cause of your GI infection – to guide its treatment, eliminate its source, and limit its spread.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) helps the body maintain stable levels of calcium in the blood. It is part of a feedback loop that includes calcium, PTH, vitamin D, and, to some extent, phosphorus (phosphate) and magnesium. Conditions and diseases that disrupt this feedback loop can cause inappropriate elevations or decreases in calcium and PTH levels and lead to symptoms of hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia. This test measures the amount of PTH in the blood.
PTH is produced by four button-sized parathyroid glands that are located in the neck behind the thyroid gland. Normally, these glands secrete PTH into the bloodstream in response to low blood calcium levels. The hormone works in three ways to help raise blood calcium levels back to normal (two are direct and one is indirect):

PTH directly promotes the release of calcium from bones into the bloodstream.
It directly acts on the kidneys to reduce the elimination of calcium in the urine while promoting the elimination of phosphorus in the urine.
The indirect effect stimulates the kidneys to convert vitamin D from the inactive to the active form, which in turn increases the absorption of calcium from food in the intestines.

As calcium levels begin to increase in the blood, PTH normally decreases.
Parathyroid hormone itself is composed of 84 amino acids (sometimes called PTH (1-84)). Intact and fragmented hormone is present in and secreted by the parathyroid gland. The intact hormone represents a smaller fraction, but its portion is increased when calcium levels are low and decreased when calcium levels are high.
Once released into the bloodstream, PTH has a very short life span; levels fall by half in less than 5 minutes due to uptake and cleavage in the liver and kidneys. The fragments are referred to as C-terminal fragments and are variably sized, missing anywhere from 6 amino acids to more than half the N-terminal portion of the molecule. C-terminal fragments have a longer half-life, exist in much higher concentrations, and are eventually cleared by the kidneys.
Although it was originally thought that the C-terminal fragments were inactive, it now appears that certain fragments may have biologic activities that are able to oppose those of intact PTH.

A PTH test may be ordered when a test for calcium is abnormal. It may be ordered when someone has symptoms associated with increased calcium, such as:

Fatigue
Nausea
Abdominal pain
Thirst

PTH may also be ordered when a person has symptoms associated with decreased calcium, such as:

Abdominal pain
Muscle cramps
Tingling fingers or toes

A healthcare practitioner may order a PTH test along with a calcium test at intervals when someone has been treated for a disease or condition that affects calcium regulation, such as the removal of a parathyroid tumor, or when a person has end-stage renal disease.
Sometimes, an intraoperative PTH test will be ordered when someone who has hyperparathyroidism is undergoing surgery to have abnormal parathyroid tissue removed to ensure removal of all of the abnormal glands, which can occasionally vary in number and location.



","



A healthcare practitioner will evaluate both calcium  and PTH results together to determine whether the levels are appropriate and are in balance as they should be. If both PTH and calcium levels are normal, then it is likely that the body's calcium regulation system is functioning properly.
Low levels of PTH may be due to conditions causing increased calcium or to an abnormality in PTH production causing hypoparathyroidism.
Excess PTH secretion may be due to hyperparathyroidism, which is most frequently caused by a benign parathyroid tumor. In rare cases, it may be caused by cancer.
The table below summarizes results that may be seen:



Calcium

Calcium - PTH Relationship

If calcium levels are low and PTH levels high, then the parathyroid glands are responding appropriately, producing appropriate amounts of PTH. Depending on the degree of hypocalcemia, a healthcare practitioner may investigate a low calcium level further by measuring vitamin D, phosphorus, and magnesium levels.
If calcium levels are low and PTH levels are normal or low, then PTH is not responding properly and the person tested probably has hypoparathyroidism. Hypoparathyroidism is a failure of the parathyroid glands to produce sufficient PTH. It may be due to a variety of conditions and may be persistent, progressive, or transient. Causes include an autoimmune disorder, parathyroid damage or removal during surgery, a genetic condition, or a severe illness. Those affected will generally have low PTH levels, low calcium levels, and high phosphorus levels.
If calcium levels are high and PTH levels are high, then the parathyroid glands are producing inappropriately high amounts of PTH. A healthcare practitioner may order X-rays or other imaging studies to help determine the cause and evaluate the severity of hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is a group of conditions characterized by an overproduction of PTH by the parathyroid glands that is separated into primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. (See Parathyroid Diseases for more on this.)
If calcium levels are high and PTH levels are low, then the parathyroid glands are responding properly, but a healthcare practitioner is likely to perform further investigations to check for non-parathyroid-related reasons for the elevated calcium, such as rare mutations in calcium receptors or tumors that secrete a peptide that has PTH-like activity and increases calcium concentration, which in turn decreases PTH.




","



Currently, the most prevalent assay for PTH is the intact PTH assay, which typically measures the whole molecule (PTH 1-84) and the larger fragments (predominantly PTH 1-74). While this assay is known as the ""intact"" assay, it measures large fragments that are slightly smaller than the truly intact hormone. There are less common but newer assays that detect only the whole molecule, which has the greatest bioactivity. The ""intact"" and ""whole or bioactive"" assays have different reference ranges, but typically their results yield similar interpretations. The effects of fragmentation and disease are still being studied, and there are instances when the two assays may yield a different interpretation.
Drugs that may increase PTH levels include phosphates, anticonvulsants, steroids, isoniazid, lithium, and rifampin.
Parathyroid cancers may be associated with familial hyperparathyroidism and MEN- I syndromes.



",,"



The so-called intact PTH is the most frequently ordered parathyroid hormone test. It is used to help diagnose the cause of a low or high calcium level and to help distinguish between parathyroid-related and non-parathyroid-related causes. It may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment when an individual has a parathyroid-related condition. PTH is routinely monitored for people with chronic kidney disease or who are on dialysis.
A calcium test is almost always ordered along with a PTH test. It is not just the level in the blood that is important but the balance between calcium and PTH and the response of the parathyroid glands to changing levels of calcium. Usually, healthcare practitioners are concerned about either severe imbalances in calcium regulation that may require medical intervention or persistent imbalances that indicate an underlying problem.
PTH levels can be used to monitor people who have conditions or diseases that cause chronic calcium imbalances or to monitor those who have had surgery or another treatment for a parathyroid tumor.

To help diagnose pernicious anemia, the most common cause of vitamin B12 deficiency


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Parietal cell antibodies are autoantibodies, proteins produced by the immune system that mistakenly target a type of specialized cells that line the stomach wall. This test detects these antibodies in the blood to help diagnose pernicious anemia.
Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition that can occur when the body's immune system targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against the parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor.

Parietal cells are specialized cells in the stomach that make acid to help in food digestion and also make intrinsic factor.
Intrinsic factor is required for the absorption of vitamin B12 from food.

During digestion, stomach acids produced by parietal cells release vitamin B12 from food, which binds to intrinsic factor to form a complex. The formation of this complex allows vitamin B12 to be absorbed in the small intestine. Among having functional roles in the brain and nervous system, vitamin B12 is important in the production of red blood cells (RBCs).
When the body’s immune system mistakenly targets its own tissues and develops antibodies directed against parietal cells and/or intrinsic factor, it can cause inflammation and progressively damage the parietal cells. This autoimmune condition, called autoimmune atrophic gastritis, can disrupt the production or function of intrinsic factor.
Without sufficient intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 goes largely unabsorbed, leading to vitamin B12 deficiency. Deficiency in vitamin B12 can result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the production of fewer but larger red blood cells (macrocytes). Vitamin B12 deficiency can also result in nerve-related signs and symptoms (neuropathy), such as numbness and tingling that start first in the hands and feet, muscle weakness, slow reflexes, loss of balance and unsteady walking. Other disorders can cause vitamin B12 deficiency and result in megaloblastic anemia. When it is due to a lack of intrinsic factor, it is called pernicious anemia. Besides anemia, a decrease in the numbers of neutrophils and platelets (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) may also occur.
The tests for parietal cell and/or intrinsic factor antibodies may be used along with several other tests, such as complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear, to help diagnose pernicious anemia.

As part of an investigation, when you have anemia and/or neuropathy that may be due to a vitamin B12 deficiency; when you have red blood cells that are much larger than normal (macrocytic)


","



The parietal cell antibody test is not a frequently ordered test because it is not as specific as the intrinsic factor antibody test. It may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest a vitamin B12 deficiency and when pernicious anemia is suspected. Signs and symptoms may include:

Larger than normal red blood cells (RBCs); these are often detected before the other signs and symptoms emerge, found, for example, with a CBC during routine testing for a health examination.
Pale complexion
Weakness, fatigue
Numbness and tingling in the feet and/or hands that may be due to neuropathy

These findings usually prompt vitamin B12 and folate testing and may lead to methylmalonic acid testing (an early indicator of vitamin B12 deficiency) and homocysteine testing.
An intrinsic factor antibody test and parietal cell antibody test may be ordered as follow-up tests when a person has a decreased vitamin B12 level and increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels.



","



The results of this test are often taken into consideration with the results of other laboratory tests to help make a diagnosis.
A decreased vitamin B12 level and/or increased methylmalonic acid and homocysteine levels as well as a positive test result for intrinsic factor antibodies and/or parietal cell antibodies means that it is likely that the person tested has pernicious anemia.
A negative test result does not necessarily mean that a person does not have pernicious anemia. At least 10% of those affected will not have parietal cell antibodies.
Parietal cell antibodies are not as specific as intrinsic factor antibodies. About 90% of those with pernicious anemia will have parietal cell antibodies, but they may also be found in:

Up to 50% of people with gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining)
Up to 30% of people with inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis)
A variety of other conditions and autoimmune disorders
A small percentage of the general population

The parietal cell antibody test is not used to diagnose or monitor these conditions.



","



Vitamin B12-associated anemia may take several years to develop as a normal person typically has large stores of B12 in reserve. Symptoms tend to emerge only when these stores become depleted.
Recent evidence indicates that people with type 1 diabetes may have an increase in the risk of developing parietal cell antibodies.



",,"



A parietal cell antibody test may be used along with or following an intrinsic factor antibody test to help determine the cause of a vitamin B12 deficiency and to help confirm a diagnosis of pernicious anemia.
It is usually used as a follow-up test after other laboratory tests, such as a vitamin B12 test, a methylmalonic acid test, or a complete blood count (CBC) with a blood smear examination, establish that a person has a vitamin B12 deficiency and associated megaloblastic anemia and/or neuropathy.

The partial thromboplastin time (PTT; also known as activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)) is a screening test that helps evaluate a person's ability to appropriately form blood clots. It measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in a sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. The PTT assesses the amount and the function of certain proteins in the blood called coagulation or clotting factors that are an important part of blood clot formation.
When body tissue(s) or blood vessel walls are injured, bleeding occurs and a process called hemostasis begins. Small cell fragments called platelets stick to and then clump (aggregate) at the injury site. At the same time, a process called the coagulation cascade begins and coagulation factors are activated in a step-by-step process. Through the cascading reactions, threads called fibrin form and crosslink into a net that clings to the injury site and stabilizes it. This forms a stable blood clot to seal off injuries to blood vessels, prevents additional blood loss, and gives the damaged areas time to heal.
Each part of this hemostatic process must function properly and be present in sufficient quantity for normal blood clot formation. If the amount of one or more factors is too low, or if the factors cannot do their job properly, then a stable clot may not form and bleeding continues.
With a PTT, your result is compared to a normal reference interval for clotting time. When your PTT takes longer than normal to clot, the PTT is considered ""prolonged.""
When a PTT is used to investigate bleeding or clotting episodes or to rule out a bleeding or clotting disease (e.g., preoperative evaluation), it is often ordered along with a prothrombin time (PT). A healthcare practitioner will evaluate the results of both tests to help rule out or determine the cause of bleeding or clotting disorder.
It is now understood that coagulation tests such as the PT and PTT are based on what happens artificially in the test setting (in vitro) and thus do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, they can be used to evaluate certain components of the hemostasis system. The PTT and PT tests each evaluate coagulation factors that are part of different groups of chemical reaction pathways in the cascade, called the intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways.

The PTT is used to evaluate the coagulation factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK).
A PT test evaluates the coagulation factors VII, X, V, II, and I (fibrinogen).

The PTT may be ordered along with other tests such as a PT when you have:

Unexplained bleeding or easy bruising
A blood clot in a vein or artery
An acute condition such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that may cause both bleeding and clotting as coagulation factors are used up at a rapid rate
A chronic condition such as liver disease that may affect clotting

A PTT may be ordered:

When you are switched from heparin therapy to longer-term warfarin (Coumadin®) therapy, the two are overlapped and both the PTT and PT are monitored until you have stabilized.
When you have a surgical operation scheduled; you may have a PTT prior to surgery when the surgery carries an increased risk of blood loss and/or when you have a clinical history of bleeding, such as frequent or excessive nose bleeds and easy bruising, which may indicate the presence of a bleeding disorder.

PTT results are typically reported in seconds.
A PTT result that falls within a laboratory's reference interval usually indicates normal clotting function. However, even with a normal PTT result, mild to moderate deficiencies of a single coagulation factor may be present. The PTT may not be prolonged until the factor levels have decreased to 30% to 40% of normal. On the other hand, lupus anticoagulant may be present but may not prolong the PTT result. If the lupus anticoagulant (LA) is suspected, a more sensitive LA-sensitive PTT or a dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) can be used to test for it. (See below for more about LA-sensitive PTT.)
A prolonged PTT means that clotting is taking longer to occur than normal and may be due to a variety of causes.
A prolonged PTT may be due to:

Underlying conditions that cause low levels of clotting factors, such as:
	
Liver disease—most coagulation factors are produced by the liver, thus liver disease may cause prolonged PT and PTT. However, PT is more likely to be prolonged than PTT.
Vitamin K deficiency—vitamin K is essential for the formation of several clotting factors. Vitamin K deficiencies are rare but can be caused by an extremely poor diet, malabsorption disorders, or prolonged use of certain antibiotics, for example. PT is more likely to be prolonged than is PTT.




Less common inherited clotting factor deficiencies:
	
von Willebrand disease (vWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder and it affects platelet function due to decreased von Willebrand factor. PTT is normal in most cases of vWD but can be prolonged in severe vWD.
Hemophilia A and hemophilia B (Christmas disease) are two other inherited bleeding disorders resulting from a decrease in factors VIII and IX, respectively.
Deficiencies of other coagulation factors, like factors XII and XI. Deficiency in XI can cause abnormal bleeding, but deficiency of XII is not associated with bleeding risk in the body.
		 


A nonspecific inhibitor such as the lupus anticoagulant— this is an autoantibody (antiphospholipid antibody) that interferes with the PTT because it targets substances called phospholipids that are used in the PTT. Though they can prolong the PTT result, in the body they are associated with excessive clotting. A person who produces these antibodies may be at an increased risk for a blood clot. (See the article on Antiphospholipid Antibodies and Antiphospholipid Syndrome for additional details.)
	 
A specific inhibitor—although relatively rare, these are antibodies that specifically target certain coagulation factors (known as factor-specific inhibitor), affecting how they function. An example is an antibody that targets factor VIII. Factor-specific inhibitors can cause severe bleeding.
	 
Heparin—is an anticoagulant and will prolong a PTT, either as a contaminant of the sample or as part of anticoagulation therapy. For anticoagulant therapy, the target PTT is often about 1.5 to 2.5 times longer than a person's pretreatment level. PTT is still being used to monitor standard heparin therapy.
	 
Warfarin (Coumadin®) anticoagulation therapy—the PTT is not used to monitor warfarin therapy, but PTT may be prolonged by warfarin at high dose. Typically, the prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) is used to monitor warfarin therapy.
	 
Other anticoagulants—anticoagulation therapy with direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., argatroban, dabigatran) or direct factor Xa inhibitor (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban)
	 
Prolonged PTT levels may also be seen with certain types of leukemia, excessive bleeding in pregnant women prior to or after giving birth, or recurrent miscarriages.


Results of the PTT are often interpreted with results of the PT in determining what condition may be present.

A shortened PTT may be due to:

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)—in the early stages of DIC, there are circulating procoagulants that shorten the PTT.
Advanced cancer (ovarian, pancreatic, colon), except when the liver is involved
An acute-phase reaction: this is a condition causing extensive tissue inflammation or trauma that significantly elevates factor VIII levels. It is usually a temporary change that is not monitored with a PTT. When the condition causing the acute phase reaction is resolved, the PTT returns to normal.




","



Two anticoagulants often used, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and danaparoid, may not prolong the PTT and, if indicated, should be monitored using the heparin anti-factor Xa assay.
Several factors can affect results of a PTT and the interpretation of test results:

People with high hematocrit levels may have falsely prolonged PTTs.
Heparin contamination – this is the most common problem, especially when blood is collected from intravenous lines that are being kept ""open"" with heparin flushes.
Drugs such as antihistamines, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), aspirin, and chlorpromazine
In some cases, heparin can unintentionally decrease a person's platelet count in a complication called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. When this occurs, substitute anticoagulants such as a direct thrombin inhibitor (e.g., argatroban or bivalirudin) may be given. The PTT test may also be used to monitor these therapies. It does not directly measure the anticoagulants used but measures their effect on blood clotting.




",,"



The PTT is used primarily to investigate unexplained bleeding or clotting. It may be ordered along with a prothrombin time (PT/INR) to evaluate the process that the body uses to form blood clots to help stop bleeding. These tests are usually the starting points for investigating excessive bleeding or clotting disorders.
By evaluating the results of the two tests together, a healthcare practitioner can gain clues as to what bleeding or clotting disorder may be present. The PTT and PT are not diagnostic but usually provide information on whether further tests may be needed.
Some examples of uses of a PTT include:

To identify coagulation factor deficiency; if the PTT is prolonged, further studies can then be performed to identify what coagulation factors may be deficient or dysfunctional, or to determine if an antibody against a coagulation factor (known as a factor-specific inhibitor) is present in the blood.
To detect nonspecific autoantibodies (antiphospholipid antibodies), such as lupus anticoagulant; these are associated with clotting episodes and with recurrent miscarriages. For this reason, PTT testing may be performed as part of a clotting disorder panel to help investigate recurrent miscarriages or diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). A variation of the PTT called the LA-sensitive PTT may be used for this purpose.
To monitor standard (unfractionated, UF) heparin anticoagulant therapy; however, some labs now use the anti-Xa test to monitor heparin therapy. Heparin is an anticoagulation drug that is given intravenously (IV) or by injection to prevent and to treat blood clots (embolism and thromboembolism). It prolongs PTT. When heparin is administered for therapeutic purposes, it must be closely monitored. If too much is given, the treated person may bleed excessively; with too little, the treated person may continue to clot.
Based on carefully obtained patient histories, the PTT and PT are sometimes selectively performed before a scheduled surgery or other invasive procedures to screen for potential bleeding tendencies.

","

To determine if you have, or recently had, a parvovirus B19 infection if you are at increased risk of complications from this viral infection; if a fetus is at high risk of contracting parvovirus B19 from a mother who is infected or has been exposed


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm for parvovirus B19 antibody testing; to detect the virus itself, the sample tested may be blood or, rarely, bone marrow; in certain cases, fetal cord blood or amniotic fluid may be collected to test for fetal parvovirus B19 infection.


","



Parvovirus B19 is a virus that causes a common childhood illness, also called ""fifth disease"" or ""erythema infectiosum."" The virus is found in respiratory droplets during an infection and is easily transmitted to others through close physical contact. Parvovirus can also be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus and transmitted through exposure to blood and blood products.
In the United States, as many as 50% of adults and 85% of the elderly have been infected with parvovirus B19, usually as children or young adults. The infection typically has an incubation period of several days to 2-3 weeks, is active for a short period, and then begins to resolve.
For most people, parvovirus B19 infection is indistinguishable from other mild illnesses that develop and go away within a short time period. Many who are infected have no symptoms or have mild flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, a slight fever, headache, or an upset stomach, and many may not know that they have had a parvovirus B19 infection. The majority of people do not experience any significant symptoms or health problems and once the initial infection resolves, the person becomes immune and will not get the infection again.
Some children with the infection develop a characteristic and distinctive bright red ""slapped-cheek"" rash on both cheeks and a raised lacy rash on the torso and extremities. The rashes may come and go for several weeks, reappearing and/or intensifying with exposure to heat and sunlight and with stress. By the time the rash appears, the child is no longer considered infectious. Parvovirus is sometimes called fifth disease because it is the fifth of six common childhood illnesses that can cause rashes.
Less commonly, some adults become infected and may develop ""gloves and socks syndrome"" with painful swelling of joints and reddening of the hands and feet that typically ends abruptly at the wrists and ankles. This condition usually resolves within a few weeks. Symptoms of arthritis may also occur in adults and children, but like ""gloves and socks syndrome,"" tends to resolve a few weeks after infection. Some severe cases, however, have been tied to chronic arthritis and even to the development of rheumatoid arthritis.
Parvovirus B19 can cause major health problems in three types of patients:

People with iron deficiency anemia or a condition that affects or shortens the life of red blood cells (RBCs), such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia, may develop severe acute anemia during a parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 targets cells in the bone marrow that become RBCs and disrupts the production of new RBCs, which can more severely affect those with underlying blood disorders.
Women who are infected during pregnancy can pass the infection to their babies. Most fetuses will be fine, but a small percentage will develop severe anemia and a few may have an inflammation and infection of the heart muscle (myocarditis). These conditions can cause miscarriage, congestive heart failure in the fetus, hydrops fetalis (associated with fluid accumulation), and sometimes stillbirth. The greatest risk for fetal complications is during the second trimester of pregnancy.
In those with compromised immune systems, a parvovirus B19 infection may cause chronic anemia and be challenging to resolve. This includes people with HIV/AIDS, those who have had organ or bone marrow transplants, and those undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer.

Parvovirus B19 testing is not typically used to screen the general population and is not deemed necessary in most cases of infection because symptoms are mild and time-limited. It is usually ordered to determine whether someone is currently, or has recently been, infected with parvovirus only if they are at risk of complications. It may also sometimes be ordered to determine whether someone has ever been exposed to parvovirus. Testing involves either a measurement of parvovirus antibodies—immune proteins produced in response to parvovirus B19 exposure—or the detection of the genetic material of the virus itself (its DNA) during an active infection.

When a pregnant woman has a parvovirus B19 infection or has been exposed to someone with the virus; when someone, especially an immune-compromised person, has persistent or severe anemia


","



Parvovirus B19 testing is usually not required when a child has the characteristic ""slapped cheek"" and lacy rashes. The distinctive rashes are sufficient evidence for the health practitioner to be able to diagnose the infection. In general, most people who have or have had parvovirus B19 do not require laboratory testing because illness does not typically last more than 5-7 days and symptoms are usually mild.
Parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM antibody tests may be ordered when a pregnant female has flu-like symptoms and/or has been exposed to someone with a parvovirus B19 infection to determine if she has an active infection, had a recent infection, or has been exposed in the past.  DNA testing may be performed on fetal samples in some cases.
Antibody testing and/or DNA testing may be ordered when someone has acute or persistent anemia or joint pain that the health practitioner suspects may be due to a parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 DNA testing is usually ordered when the affected person is immune-compromised.
One or more parvovirus B19 tests may be repeated if they are initially negative but the health practitioner still suspects that a parvovirus infection is present, or to evaluate changes in concentrations of antibody over time.



","



Antibody testing
If both parvovirus B19 IgG and IgM are present, then it is likely that the person tested has an active, or had a recent, parvovirus infection. This can be confirmed by measuring IgG levels again 2 or 3 weeks later. A high level of IgG is not as important as an increasing concentration of antibody. If there is a 4-fold increase in IgG between the first and second sample, then the person has an active, or had a recent, infection.
If only IgM is present, then the person may have very recently been infected, within the previous 2-4 months. If only parvovirus B19 IgG is present, then the person had a parvovirus infection at some time in the past and has protection against the virus.
If antibody tests are negative, then the person tested has not had the infection and is not immune. If a pregnant woman is not immune and has been exposed to someone with the disease, she will typically be closely monitored by her doctor.
If someone is symptomatic but has low or undetectable levels of IgG and/or IgM, it may mean that the person either has a condition other than parvovirus B19 or that their immune system is not responding normally. i.e., not producing an adequate amount of antibody even if parvovirus is present. This may be true for people with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) and DNA testing may need to be done.
Viral detection
If a parvovirus B19 DNA test is positive, then the person is currently infected with parvovirus B19. A negative result does not rule out the infection. The virus may not be present in sufficient amount in the sample to be detected.
Fetal infection of parvovirus B19 is often detected through testing of viral DNA in maternal samples as well as samples from the baby.
The PCR assay is used to detect viral DNA and is the optimal method for detecting chronic infection in immunocompromised patients as the antibody levels are variable.



","



Sometimes a reticulocyte test may be performed along with parvovirus B19 testing to evaluate red blood cell (RBC) production. This test measures new immature RBCs, called reticulocytes, in the blood that still contain genetic material. Since parvovirus B19 disrupts RBC production, the number of reticulocytes will decrease during an active infection.
Parvovirus B19 infections are usually self-limiting (limited in duration) in otherwise healthy people. Treatment may be given to relieve symptoms and, when necessary, to address anemia.
A pregnant woman who passes parvovirus B19 infection to her fetus will be closely monitored for several weeks with periodic ultrasounds. In most cases, the fetus will be healthy. When hydrops fetalis or severe anemia develops, it can sometimes be addressed by giving the fetus a blood transfusion. The parvovirus B19 infection is not known to cause birth defects.



",,"



Parvovirus B19 testing is generally not used to test those with mild and uncomplicated infections. It is typically used to detect a current infection or determine immunity in those who are at an increased risk of complications, such as those with sickle cell anemia. There are several methods of detecting a parvovirus B19 infection:
Antibody testing
Two types of parvovirus B19 antibodies may be produced in response to an infection: IgM and IgG. IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to a parvovirus infection. They are present in most individuals within a week or two after the initial exposure. IgM antibody production rises for a short time period and then declines. Eventually, the level of parvovirus IgM antibody usually falls below detectable levels. IgG antibodies are produced by the body a few weeks after the initial infection to provide long-term protection. Levels of IgG rise during the active infection, then stabilize as the parvovirus B19 infection resolves. Once a person has been exposed to parvovirus B19, that person will have some measurable amount of IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their lifetime.
Parvovirus B19 antibody testing may be performed to determine immunity to parvovirus in pregnant women who have been exposed to someone with parvovirus B19 or who have symptoms suggestive of parvovirus infection. It may also be ordered for people who have acute or chronic anemia or persistent joint pain that may be due to a parvovirus B19 infection. By comparing the absence or presence of both IgG and IgM in the same sample, the health practitioner can distinguish between current, recent, and previous infections. Antibody testing is usually not performed on children who have the characteristic fifth disease rashes and, since parvovirus B19 infection is widespread and causes few problems to those with healthy immune systems, general population screening is rarely done.
Viral detection
Viral detection involves finding parvovirus B19 genetic material (DNA) in a blood sample or, less commonly, in a sample of bone marrow, fetal cord blood, or amniotic fluid. Parvovirus B19 DNA testing is performed primarily to detect active parvovirus infection in immune-compromised people who have acute or persistent anemia. These people will frequently not produce a sufficient amount of antibodies to detect or to resolve the infection. It may also be performed to detect the presence of the virus in babies when a mother is infected or was exposed during the pregnancy.

To help determine if a repeat prostate biopsy is indicated to help detect prostate cancer


","

The first amount of urine collected after a healthcare practitioner performs a digital rectal exam (DRE)


","



The prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) test detects genetic material (messenger RNA (mRNA)) that is produced only by the prostate. The protein PCA3 and its associated mRNA are present at low levels in normal prostate tissue. PCA3 is present in increased amounts (over-expressed) in about 90% of prostate cancers. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is also produced in increased amounts by prostate cancers but can be increased in a number of benign conditions as well.
This test measures PCA3 mRNA and PSA mRNA in the first urine sample collected following a digital rectal exam (DRE). Laboratories report a score based on the ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA called the PCA3 score.
Prostate cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate, a small gland that encircles the urethra in men. Some men may choose to undergo screening for prostate cancer using a PSA blood test. An increased PSA level is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, but PSA can also be increased with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis, infection, and a variety of other temporary conditions.
Diagnosis of prostate cancer requires performing a prostate biopsy and identifying cancer cells under the microscope. This biopsy may be done after an increased PSA result and/or an abnormal DRE. The accuracy of biopsies depends on the number of tissue samples and the sites from which they are taken. Since the biopsy takes small tissue samples, and since PSA is not cancer-specific, the initial biopsy is often negative.
A negative initial biopsy may leave the healthcare practitioner questioning whether the patient is truly cancer-free or if the cancer has been missed. Concerns over missing clinically significant cancer may prompt additional biopsies, especially if a repeat PSA is still elevated or has increased. However, each biopsy has potential complications, such as discomfort, blood in the urine (hematuria) or semen, rectal bleeding, difficulty urinating, infection, and in rare cases septicemia, so minimizing the number of biopsies performed is also desirable.
The PCA3 test can help determine if a repeat prostate biopsy would likely be positive and whether a man may avoid an unnecessary repeat biopsy. PCA3 is significantly over-expressed with prostate cancer but (unlike PSA) it is not affected by prostatitis or BPH.

",,"



The test may be ordered when a man has had an elevated PSA blood test and/or abnormal digital rectal exam (DRE) and one or more previous negative prostate biopsies. It may be ordered when another biopsy would normally be recommended and a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate the likelihood that the repeat biopsy would be positive.



","



The PCA3 test result is a ratio of PCA3 mRNA to PSA mRNA that is reported as a score. The laboratory report provides a cut-off number at which the score is considered positive.
The PCA3 test does not provide a definitive answer as to whether a man has a cancer or not. Rather, healthcare practitioners consider the test results in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical data to determine the likelihood that a repeat biopsy will be positive.
A PCA3 score that is less than the laboratory's established cutoff is considered negative and is associated with a decreased likelihood of a positive biopsy.
A PCA3 score that is greater than the laboratory's established cutoff is considered positive and is associated with an increased likelihood of a positive biopsy. Some labs provide a range in which PCA3 is considered positive but with a caution about interpreting results that are close to the cut-off value, due to normal test variability.
About 90% of prostate cancers will over-express PCA3, but the PCA3 result cannot be used to diagnose or completely rule out prostate cancer. It just helps to guide decision-making on performing another biopsy. Prostate biopsy is still the gold standard for diagnosing prostate cancer.



","



Many prostate cancers are slow-growing and not considered clinically significant. A man who has prostate cancer is more likely to live with the condition and die of something else. Prostate cancer may be managed through ""watchful waiting"" and treated if or when needed. Some prostate cancers, however, are aggressive and can grow and spread throughout the body. Distinguishing between the two can be challenging but is important. In recent years, there has been considerable concern about over-diagnosing and over-treating prostate cancers that are not clinically significant. In part, this is because the treatments carry the potential for significant complications that can impact a man's quality of life, including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.
The medical community has become increasingly conservative about recommending PSA as a screening tool in asymptomatic men (See Screening Tests for Adults (30-49): Prostate cancer and Screening Tests for Adults (50 and Up): Prostate cancer for details on screening recommendations) and are eager to find additional tools that can aid in decision-making. PCA3 is one of these tools.
A wide range of other tests and biomarkers are being investigated.

The PCA3 test is used to help decide whether a repeat prostate biopsy should be performed on a man age 50 or older who has had one or more previous negative biopsies.

","



Programmed Death-Ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a protein that can be found on the surface of many cells throughout the body. Some, but not all, tumor cells have large amounts of PD-L1 that help the tumor cells evade the body's natural defense system—the immune system. A lab test measures how much PD-L1 is present on tumor cells, which can help guide treatment of certain cancers.
One of the ways our immune system fights diseases like cancer is with T cells (T lymphocytes), a type of white blood cell. Some types of T-cells recognize and directly attack cancer cells as well as some other abnormal or infected cells. However, the body has ""immune checkpoints,"" which prevent T-cells from attacking normal cells. PD-L1 and another protein called PD-1 (Programmed Death-1) are part of an immune checkpoint. PD-L1 on the body’s normal cells recognizes and attaches to PD-1 on T cells, turning off (inactivating) the T cell so it can't attack cells.
However, some tumor cells have large amounts of PD-L1. This is a problem because it helps protect the cancer from being attacked by T cells. The cancer cells are more likely to inactivate T cells, escape immune system action, and survive.
New cancer drugs (immunotherapies) have been developed to disrupt the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1. These immunotherapies are antibodies that attach to PD-L1 or PD-1 and block their interaction so that T cells are not inactivated by cancer cells. This boosts the body's natural immune system and its ability to recognize and fight the cancer.
Blocking this immune checkpoint pathway with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies has stopped or slowed the growth of cancers such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, head and neck cancers, and Hodgkin lymphoma. These immunotherapies are also being studied for treatment of many other types of cancer.

The results of PD-L1 testing may report that PD-L1 is present or absent (expressed or not expressed) in tumor tissue, or it may be reported as a score specific for the test that you had done. The report may also include an interpretation.
If PD-L1 protein is present on the tumor tissue, then you may be a good candidate for the immunotherapy drug being considered. Not every person who has a cancer with increased PD-L1 will respond to the immunotherapy, however, and your response may change over time.
If there is little or insufficient PD-L1 present, then it is less likely that you would benefit from the immunotherapy, and a different treatment is likely to be considered.
A negative result means that insufficient PD-L1 was present in the sample tested. The amount of PD-L1 can sometimes vary in different parts of the tumor. A biopsy sample may or may not be representative of most of the tumor. PD-L1 amounts can also vary over time, for example, being present in different quantities in the original tumor compared to a recurrent tumor.



",,"



This test is used to detect PD-L1 in tumor tissue to help guide treatment of some cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer or several other cancers. Knowing whether PD-L1 is present on the cells can help determine if immunotherapy (PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors), such as atezolizumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, may be beneficial for treating the tumor.
Tissue from a tumor may be tested for PD-L1 using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine if there is a sufficient amount of PD-L1 present to make you a good candidate for inhibitor therapy. (For details about IHC, see the ""Special Techniques"" section of the article on Anatomic Pathology).
PD-L1 test variations
There are several variations of the PD-L1 test, and they are not interchangeable. Tests and test interpretation ""scoring"" types are matched up both with the kind of cancer you have and the specific immunotherapy drug that your healthcare practitioner is considering.
PD-L1 testing is required before treatment with some drugs and recommended before others. Whether testing is required or recommended depends on the specific cancer and the type of drug. Your healthcare provider can discuss the current guidance for PD-L1 testing based on your specific situation.
Testing and treatments continue to evolve. Currently, PD-L1 testing may be used to help guide therapy for cancers such as:

Non-small cell lung cancer
Bladder cancer and related urothelial cancers
Gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
Cervical cancer
Breast cancer
Melanoma

To help diagnose the cause of inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart (pericardium) and/or fluid accumulation around the heart


","

A sample of fluid collected from the pericardial sac using a procedure called a pericardiocentesis


","



The pericardium is a two-layered, sac-like membrane that surrounds the heart. Pericardial membranes produce pericardial fluid, a liquid that sits between the pericardium's membranes. The fluid acts as a lubricant for the movement of the heart, reducing friction as the heart pumps blood.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) and/or excessive accumulation of pericardial fluid (pericardial effusion). Pericardial fluid analysis is a group of tests that evaluate this liquid to help diagnose the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons for fluid accumulation in the pericardial space are:

An imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels—which drives fluid out of blood vessels—and the amount of protein in blood—which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure or cirrhosis.
An injury or inflammation of the pericardium, in which case the fluid that accumulates is called an exudate. Conditions such as infections, malignancies (metastatic cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma), or autoimmune disease may cause the accumulation of exudate.

Determining if the increased fluid is transudate or exudate is important because it helps narrow down the possible causes of pericardial fluid buildup. Healthcare practitioners and laboratorians use an initial set of tests, including cell count, protein or albumin level, and appearance of the fluid, to distinguish between transudates and exudates. Once the fluid is determined to be one or the other, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing pericarditis and/or pericardial effusion.

When a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a condition associated with inflammation of the pericardium and/or fluid accumulation around your heart


","



Pericardial fluid analysis may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a condition or disease that is causing pericarditis and/or pericardial effusion. It may be ordered when someone has some combination of the following signs and symptoms:

Chest pain, sharp or sometimes dull, that may be relieved by bending forward
Coughing
Difficulty breathing
Fever
Fatigue
Changes in heart rhythm
Enlarged heart size on chest X-ray
Abnormal pericardial appearance on echocardiogram




","



Test results can help distinguish between types of pericardial fluid and help diagnose the cause of fluid accumulation. The initial set of tests performed on a sample of pericardial fluid helps determine whether the fluid is a transudate or exudate.
Transudate
Transudates are most often caused by either congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. Typical fluid analysis results include:

Physical characteristics—fluid appears clear
Protein or albumin level—low
Cell count—few cells are present

Exudate
Exudates can be caused by a variety of conditions and diseases. Initial test results may show:

Physical characteristics—fluid may appear cloudy
Protein or albumin level—high
Cell count—increased

Additional test results and their associated causes may include:
Physical characteristics – the normal appearance of a sample of pericardial fluid is straw-colored and clear. Abnormal results may give clues to the conditions or diseases present and may include:

Milky appearance—may point to lymphatic system involvement.
Reddish pericardial fluid may indicate the presence of blood.
Cloudy, thick pericardial fluid may indicate the presence of microorganisms and/or white blood cells.

Chemical tests – in addition to protein or albumin, a glucose test may be performed. Glucose in pericardial fluid samples is typically about the same as blood glucose levels. It may be lower with infection.
Microscopic examination – normal pericardial fluid has small numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) but no red blood cells (RBCs) or microorganisms. Results of an evaluation of the different kinds of cells present may include:

Total cell counts—quantity of WBCs and RBCs in the sample. Increased WBCs may be seen with infections and other causes of pericarditis.
WBC differential—determination of percentages of different types of WBCs. An increased number of neutrophils may be seen with bacterial infections.
Cytology—a cytocentrifuged sample is treated with a special stain and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells. This may be done when a mesothelioma or metastatic cancer is suspected. The presence of certain abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or immature blood cells, can indicate what type of cancer is involved.

Infectious disease tests – routine tests may be performed to look for microorganisms if infection is suspected:

Gram stain—for direct observation of bacteria or fungi under a microscope. There should be no organisms present in pericardial fluid.
Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing—if bacteria are present, susceptibility testing can be performed to guide antimicrobial therapy. If there are no microorganisms present, it does not rule out an infection. Bacteria may be present in small numbers or their growth may be inhibited because of prior antibiotic therapy.
Adenosine deaminase—a markedly elevated level in percardial fluid in a person with symptoms that suggest tuberculosis means it is likely that person has a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in the pericardium. This is especially true when there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis in the geographic region where a person lives. (For more details, see the test page on adenosine deaminase.)

Other less common tests for infectious diseases may be performed. Those tests may identify pericardial fluid accumulation due to a viral infection, mycobacteria (such as the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis), or a parasite.



","



Increased amounts of pericardial fluid can restrict the movement of the heart. Cardiac tamponade is a condition that reflects pericardial fluid buildup to the point that pressure on the heart prevents it from filling normally. Rapid fluid buildup can be a medical emergency, causing heart failure and death. When fluid accumulates slowly, the pericardial sac stretches and symptoms gradually worsen.
A blood glucose, protein, or albumin test may be ordered to compare concentrations with those in the pericardial fluid.

Pericardial fluid analysis is used to help diagnose the cause of inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis) and/or fluid accumulation around the heart (pericardial effusion). There are two main reasons for fluid accumulation: an imbalance of pressure within blood vessels or inflammation of the pericardium. An initial set of tests, including fluid protein or albumin level, cell count, and appearance, is used to differentiate between the two types of resulting fluids, called transudate and exudate.

Transudate—an imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels (which drives fluid out of the blood vessel) and the amount of protein in blood (which keeps fluid in the blood vessel) can result in accumulation of fluid. Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. If the fluid is determined to be a transudate, then usually no more tests on the fluid are necessary.
Exudate—injury or inflammation of the pericardium may cause abnormal collection of fluid (called an exudate). Exudates are associated with a variety of conditions and diseases. If the fluid is an exudate, then several additional tests may be ordered to help diagnose the specific condition, which may include:
	
Infectious diseases – caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Infections may originate in the pericardium or spread there from other places in the body. For example, pericarditis may follow a respiratory infection or a chest cold.
Bleeding – bleeding disorders and/or trauma can lead to blood in the pericardial fluid.
Inflammatory conditions – pericarditis may follow a heart attack, radiation treatment, or be part of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Cancer – such as mesothelioma that has arisen in the pericardium or metastatic cancer that has spread to it.



Additional testing on exudate fluid may include:

Pericardial fluid glucose
Microscopic examination—a laboratory professional may place a sample of the fluid on a slide and examine it under a microscope. Normal pericardial fluid has small numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) but no red blood cells (RBCs) or microorganisms. Laboratories may examine drops of the pericardial fluid and/or use a special centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) to concentrate the fluid's cells at the bottom of a test tube. Samples are placed on a slide, treated with a special stain, and an evaluation of the different kinds of cells present is performed.
Cytology—a laboratory professional may use a cytocentrifuge to concentrate the fluid's cells on a slide. The slide is treated with a special stain and evaluated for abnormal cells, such as malignant cells (cancer cells).
Gram stain—for direct observation of bacteria or fungi under a microscope. There should be no organisms present in pericardial fluid.
Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing—ordered to detect any microorganisms, which will grow in the culture, and to guide antimicrobial therapy.
Adenosine deaminase—rarely, this test may be used to help detect tuberculosis (TB).
Less commonly ordered tests for infectious diseases, such as tests for viruses, mycobacteria (AFB smear and culture), and parasites.

To help diagnose the cause of peritonitis, an inflammation of the membrane lining the abdomen, and/or peritoneal fluid accumulation, where fluid builds up in the abdomen or around internal organs (called ascites)


","

A peritoneal fluid sample obtained by inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity


","



Peritoneal fluid is a liquid that acts as a lubricant in the abdominal cavity. It is found in small quantities (generally 5-20 mL) between the layers of the peritoneum that line the abdominal wall. Peritoneal fluid acts to moisten the outside of the organs and to reduce the friction of organ movement during digestion and movement.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis) and/or excessive accumulation of peritoneal fluid (peritoneal effusion or ascites). Peritoneal fluid analysis is a group of tests that evaluate this liquid to determine the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons that fluid may collect in the abdominal cavity are:

An imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels—which drives fluid out of blood vessels—and the amount of protein in blood—which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis.
An injury or inflammation of the peritoneum, in which case the fluid is called an exudate. This type of fluid may be the result of conditions such as infection, malignancies (metastatic cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma), pancreatitis, ruptured gallbladder, or autoimmune disease.

Determining the type of fluid present (transudate or exudates) is important because it helps narrow down the possible causes of fluid buildup or inflammation. Healthcare practitioners and laboratorians use an initial set of tests, including cell count, serum and fluid albumin levels, and appearance of the fluid, to distinguish between transudates and exudates. Once the fluid is determined to be one or the other, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing ascites.

","



Test results can help distinguish between types of peritoneal fluid and help diagnose the cause of fluid accumulation. The initial set of tests performed on a sample of peritoneal fluid helps determine whether the fluid is a transudate or exudate. Findings may include:
Transudate
Most ascitic fluids are transudates and are caused by either congestive heart failure or hepatic cirrhosis. Typical fluid analysis results include:

Physical characteristics—fluid generally appears clear or straw-colored
Protein—less than 3 g/dL 
Albumin level—low (typically evaluated as the difference between serum albumin and peritoneal fluid albumin, termed serum-ascites albumin gradient, or SAAG; values above 1.1 g/dL are considered evidence of a transudate.)
Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) fluid/serum ratio—less than 0.6
Glucose—equal to glucose level in the blood
Cell count—few cells are present, usually lymphocytes
Specific gravity—less than 1.015

Exudate

Physical characteristics—fluid may appear cloudy
Protein—greater than 3 g/dL 
Albumin level—higher than in transudates (typically with a SAAG less than 1.1 g/dL)
Lactate dehydrogenase (LD) fluid/serum ratio—greater than 0.6
Glucose—less than 60 mg/dL
Cell count—increased
Specific gravity—greater than 1.015

Exudates can be caused by a variety of conditions and diseases and usually require further testing to aid in the diagnosis. Infections, trauma, various cancers, or pancreatitis may cause exudates. The following is a list of additional tests that a healthcare practitioner may order depending on the suspected cause and typical results.
Physical characteristics – the normal appearance of a peritoneal fluid sample is usually straw-colored and clear. Abnormal appearances may give clues to conditions or diseases present and may include:

Yellow with liver disease, milky from obstruction of the lymphatic system, and greenish from bile
Reddish peritoneal fluid may indicate the presence of blood, most often due to trauma.
Cloudy peritoneal fluid may indicate the presence of microbes and/or white blood cells (WBCs), pointing to an infection. It may also indicate lymph system blockage or trauma.

Chemical tests – tests that may be performed in addition to albumin may include:

Glucose—typically about the same as blood glucose levels; may be lower with infection
Amylase—increased with pancreatitis
Tumor markers—to identify type of malignancy

Microscopic examination – may be performed if infection or cancer is suspected; normal peritoneal fluid has small numbers of WBCs but no red blood cells (RBCs) or microbes. Results of an evaluation of the different kinds of cells present may include:

Total cell counts—WBCs and RBCs in the sample are enumerated. Increased WBCs may be seen with infections and malignant conditions.
WBC differential—determination of percentages of different types of WBCs; an increased number of neutrophils may be seen with bacterial infections.
Cytology—a special centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) concentrates a small sample of cells that is then treated with a special stain to be examined under a microscope for abnormal cells and for white blood cell differentiation. The differential can help determine whether the cells are the result of an infection or the presence of a tumor.

Infectious disease tests – tests may be performed to look for microbes if an infection is suspected.

Gram stain—for direct observation of bacteria or fungi under a microscope; there should be no microbes present in peritoneal fluid.
Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing—if bacteria are present, susceptibility testing can be performed to guide antimicrobial therapy. If there are no microbes present, it does not rule out an infection; they may be present in small numbers or their growth may be inhibited because of prior antibiotic therapy.
Fungal tests—if a culture is positive, the fungus or fungi causing the infection will be identified in the report and susceptibility testing may be done to guide therapy.
Adenosine deaminase—a markedly elevated level in peritoneal fluid in a person with symptoms that suggest tuberculosis means it is likely that person has a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in that region of the body. This is especially true when there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis in the geographic region where a person lives. (For more details, see the article on Adenosine Deaminase.)

Other less common tests for infectious diseases may be performed to identify a virus, mycobacteria (such as the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis), or a parasite as the cause of an infection and fluid accumulation.

A blood glucose or albumin may be ordered to compare concentrations with those in the peritoneal fluid. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have a systemic infection, then a blood culture may be ordered in addition to the peritoneal fluid analysis.

Peritoneal fluid analysis is used to help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites) and/or inflammation of the peritoneum (peritonitis). There are two main reasons for fluid accumulation, and an initial set of tests is used to differentiate between the two types of fluid that may be produced, transudate or exudate. These tests typically include:

Fluid albumin level—the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) calculation (serum albumin level minus the fluid albumin level) may be used to differentiate between transudates and exudates. A SAAG level of 1.1 g/dL or greater suggests the presence of a transudate and less than 1.1 g/dL, an exudate.
Cell count and differential
Appearance

Transudate—an imbalance between the pressure within blood vessels (which drives fluid out of the blood vessel) and the amount of protein in blood (which keeps fluid in the blood vessel) can result in accumulation of fluid (called a transudate). Transudates are most often caused by congestive heart failure , nephrotic syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis. If the fluid is determined to be a transudate, then usually no more tests on the fluid are necessary.
Exudate—injury or inflammation of the peritoneum may cause abnormal collection of fluid (called an exudate). Exudates are associated with infections, malignancies, pancreatitis, ruptured gallbladder, or autoimmune disease. Laboratory tests may be performed to determine one of the following conditions:

Infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi; infections may originate in the peritoneum due to a rupture of the appendix, perforation of the intestines or the abdominal wall, contamination during surgery, or an infection from other places in the body that has spread to the peritoneum.
Inflammatory conditions – peritonitis due to certain chemicals, irradiation, or rarely an autoimmune disorder
Malignancies – such as mesothelioma, tumor of the liver (hepatoma), lymphoma, or metastatic cancer
Pancreatitis – due to certain drugs, infections, blockages, and circulating lipids (fats)

Additional testing on exudate fluid may include:

Peritoneal fluid glucose, amylase, tumor markers, bilirubin, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LD)
Microscopic examination – may be performed if infection or cancer is suspected; a laboratory professional may use a special centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) to concentrate the fluid's cells on a slide. The slide is treated with a special stain and evaluated for abnormal cells, such as malignant cells (cancer cells).

Pharmacogenetic testing is available for a relatively limited number of medications. Pharmacogenetics tests are generally not widely used and not all insurers will cover their cost. Individuals should consult with their healthcare practitioners about these issues.
Pharmacogenetic tests are intended to provide the healthcare practitioner and patient with additional information when selecting drug treatments and dosages. For a better understanding, patients may want to consult with a genetic counselor prior to and after having a pharmacogenetic test performed. Genetic counseling and informed consent are recommended for all genetic testing.

To monitor the phenobarbital level in your blood to ensure a therapeutic level while avoiding toxic side effects


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Phenobarbital is a long-acting barbiturate, an anti-epileptic drug (AED) and sedating drug that depresses the nervous system. Healthcare practitioners usually prescribe it to prevent seizures or to relieve anxiety. It is often prescribed to treat epilepsy and other seizure disorders because the drug stabilizes electrical activity in the brain. This test measures the phenobarbital level in the blood.
When you are being treated with phenobarbital, it is important to maintain a stable level of phenobarbital in the blood within the therapeutic range. If the level is too low, you may experience seizures or anxiety. If the level is too high, you could experience side effects or even toxicity. The toxic effects include drowsiness, confusion, and lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movement (ataxia), which can affect things like driving performance. If you are treated long-term, you may also develop tolerance to the sedative effects of the drug and become psychologically or physically dependent.
Maintaining a constant, therapeutic level of phenobarbital in the blood can be difficult. The gap between the level at which the drug is therapeutic and the level at which toxic side effects can occur is very small. This is called a narrow therapeutic index and is a primary reason the drug requires close monitoring.
Furthermore, phenobarbital is broken down (metabolized) by liver enzymes and eliminated in the urine at different rates, depending on your age and overall health. For different dose, age and health, elimination can take several days to weeks. Once the body has reached its maximum capacity to metabolize phenobarbital, even small increases in dose can result in large increases of the drug level in the blood. Side effects can become more severe and toxicity may occur.
Your healthcare provider will monitor your response to phenobarbital to make sure that the desired level of the drug is maintained in the blood and to determine the dose that works best for you. Your healthcare practitioner might order a phenobarbital level at the start of treatment and any time while you are on the medication to determine if the dose is right. The practitioner might also decide to order a test if you begin taking another medication because clinically significant drug interactions may occur.

","

At the start of therapy and at a regular intervals during treatment; when someone has signs and symptoms of toxicity or is experiencing seizures


","



A healthcare practitioner will usually order the test after the start of phenobarbital treatment and every few weeks thereafter. Testing may be more frequent any time the dose is adjusted up or down. Once a stable blood level of phenobarbital is achieved and is in the therapeutic range, then the healthcare practitioner will typically monitor levels at regular intervals to ensure that they are stable.
More frequent testing may be done if you begin taking or discontinue another medication that affects phenobarbital levels.
A healthcare provider might also order phenobarbital levels if you do not appear to be responding to the medication and continue to experience seizures.
Testing may be ordered when you experience side effects from phenobarbital. Most side effects are not serious and often go away with no further action. You should notify their healthcare provider if any of the following persist or become severe:

Drowsiness
Headache, dizziness
Depression
Excitement (especially in children)
Upset stomach, vomiting
Nightmares, increased dreaming
Constipation
Joint or muscle pain

If any of the following symptoms are present, the healthcare provider should be notified immediately:

Seizures
Mouth sores, sore throat
Easy bruising, bloody nose, unusual bleeding
Unexplained fever
Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Severe skin rash




","



The therapeutic range for adults taking phenobarbital is 15-40 micrograms/milliliter (mcg/ml) (65-173 micromole/liter) for seizure treatment, and 5-15 micrograms/milliliter (mcg/ml) (22-65 micromole/liter) for sedative-hypnotic use. The therapeutic range for seizure treatment in children (younger than 5 years old) is narrower: 15-30 micrograms/milliliter (mcg/ml) (65-130 micromole/liter).
Within these ranges, most people will respond to the drug without displaying symptoms of toxicity. However, each person's response to the drug and side effects is individual. You may experience side effects even with blood levels at the low end of the therapeutic range or continue to have seizures at the upper end. As with other anti-epileptic drugs, your healthcare provider will work with you to find the dosage that works best.



","



Keep all appointments with your healthcare provider and the laboratory. Your healthcare practitioner will order certain lab tests to check your response to phenobarbital.
Do not let anyone else take your medication. Ask your pharmacist any questions you have about refilling your prescription.
It is important for you to keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines you are taking, as well as any products such as vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements. You should bring this list with you each time you visit a healthcare provider or if you are admitted to a hospital. It is also important information to carry with you in case of emergencies.
You should take phenobarbital exactly as your healthcare provider has prescribed it. Do not decrease, increase the dose, or discontinue the medication on your own because doing so can increase your risk of having a seizure and can affect the levels of your other medications. Always consult your healthcare provider if you are having problems taking phenobarbital.



","



This test is used to measure and monitor the amount of phenobarbital in the blood and to determine whether the drug level is within a therapeutic range. This test is used to ensure that the blood level of phenobarbital is not too low to cause a recurrence of seizures or too high to cause side effects. Depending on the result, your healthcare practitioner may adjust the drug dose up or down.
Your healthcare practitioner might decide to order a phenobarbital level if you begin taking another medication because drug interactions can affect how your body responds to phenobarbital. The following drugs are reported to have clinically significant interactions with phenobarbital:

Oral blood-thinning medications like warfarin
Antidepressants and tricyclics, including MAO inhibitor antidepressants
Central nervous system depressants, sedatives, hypnotics and tranquilizers
Antihistamines
Alcohol
Oral contraceptives
Corticosteroids like prednisone

To determine the level of the drug phenytoin in your blood in order to maintain a therapeutic level and to detect potential for toxicity


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



This test measures the amount of phenytoin in the blood.
Phenytoin is a drug prescribed to treat or prevent the recurrence of certain types of seizures (see Epilepsy), including complex partial seizures (impaired consciousness that is preceded, accompanied, or followed by psychological symptoms) or generalized tonic-clonic seizures (involve abrupt loss of consciousness, respiratory arrest, muscle rigidity). It has been widely used in the United States since its development in 1938. It is still being prescribed but is beginning to be replaced by newer drugs. Phenytoin may be used alone or with phenobarbital or other anticonvulsants.
Phenytoin blood testing is ordered because phenytoin blood levels must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If levels are too low, the affected person may experience seizures; if they are too high, the person may experience symptoms associated with phenytoin toxicity. These may include loss of balance and falling, involuntary eye movement from side to side (nystagmus), confusion, slurred speech, tremors, and low blood pressure.
Maintaining a therapeutic level of phenytoin in the blood can be a challenge due to several reasons:

The absorption rates vary among different preparations of the drug.
Phenytoin is metabolized by the liver enzymes. Enzymes in the liver process phenytoin at rates that differ from person to person and are affected by age (children metabolize it more quickly while the elderly metabolize it more slowly) and by the health of the liver. When the body has reached its capacity to process phenytoin, small increases in the dose can cause large increases in blood concentration, increasing the severity of side effects and causing phenytoin toxicity.
Most phenytoin is bound to protein in the bloodstream. But it is the unbound ""free"" portion that is active. If a person has a lower than normal amount of protein in their blood, such as low albumin in liver failure or in elderly, then the person may have an excess of active phenytoin.
A number of drug interactions could cause alteration of phenytoin levels.

Phenytoin's total effect can be unpredictable. Dosages must be adjusted slowly until a steady concentration in the blood is reached. The time to attain a steady-state level of phenytoin may vary from several days to several weeks because of substantial variations among patients in the amount of time it takes to metabolize phenytoin. Healthcare practitioners must also watch for side effects and adverse reactions during initial dosage adjustment and over time. In some cases, the severity of side effects may make it necessary to consider treating a patient with an alternative anti-seizure medication.

At regular intervals to monitor; as needed to detect low or toxic concentrations


","



Phenytoin is ordered frequently when a person begins phenytoin treatment and when/if a person's medications change (other drugs are started, stopped, or changed) or if there is a change in the status of the person's health. Once stable blood concentrations in the therapeutic range have been achieved, phenytoin is monitored at regular intervals to ensure that it remains in this range.
The test may be ordered when a person's condition does not appear to be responding to phenytoin (e.g., the person continues to have seizures) to determine whether the concentration is too low, the medication is ineffective, and/or to determine if the person is complying with therapy (taking the phenytoin regularly).
The test may also be ordered when a person experiences side effects or exhibits symptoms that the healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to toxicity. Toxic symptoms can affect the mouth, cardiovascular and nervous systems, and the eyes and include:

Swelling of the gums and/or lymph nodes
Excess facial and body hair (hirsutism)
Insomnia
Nausea
Vomiting
Confusion and irritability
Difficulty swallowing
Fatigue
Fever
Rashes
Involuntary eye movement
Abnormal heartbeat
Low blood pressure
Coma
Osteoporosis

A free phenytoin level may be ordered when a person has a condition in which the percentage of free or active phenytoin may be increased. Some examples of these conditions include:

Kidney failure
Liver disease
Low blood levels of albumin (hypoalbuminemia)




","



Test results may vary depending on the person's age, gender, health history, the method used for the testing and co-administrated medications.
The therapeutic ranges for most adults have been established at 10.0-20.0 mcg/mL for total phenytoin (bound plus unbound) and 1.0-2.0 mcg/mL for free phenytoin (unbound only). This reference range for unbound phenytoin (free) was established based on an assumed 10% unbound drug fraction. However, the free fraction of phenytoin can vary from 3% to 37% among patients.
In general, when phenytoin results are in the therapeutic range, most patients will respond to the drug without symptoms of toxicity. Response and side effects will be individual, however. Some people will experience seizures at the low end of the therapeutic range and some people will experience excessive side effects at the upper end. People should work closely with their healthcare practitioner to find the dosage and concentration that works the best for them. Dosage determinations and adjustments must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.



","



People who take phenytoin long-term may develop vitamin D deficiency, numbness in their extremities due to nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy), acne, excessive hair on their face or body, a thickening of facial features, or weakness of their bones. Rarely, a person may develop a severe rash and skin condition that requires hospitalization.
Women who use phenytoin during pregnancy are at an increased risk of having babies born with several types of birth defects, such as growth problems, heart defects, and cleft palate. Women who want to become pregnant should talk to their healthcare practitioner.
Phenytoin is sometimes prescribed for other conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia, which causes episodes of sharp pain along the jaw, and other causes of nerve pain. This use must also be monitored.
Phenytoin is not effective for patients with absence seizures (impaired consciousness, often abrupt onset and brief).
A large variety of prescribed drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements can increase, decrease, or interfere with the concentration of phenytoin in the blood and its effects.

Drugs whose effects and/or levels are reduced by phenytoin include corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), estrogens (for hormone replacement), warfarin, antidepressants, antilipidemic agents (e.g., atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin), calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, verapamil), azoles (e.g., variconazole), oral contraceptives and other forms of birth control such as Depo-Provera or implants.
Drugs that may increase phenytoin blood levels include antiepileptic drugs (e.g., ethosuximide, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide), antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline), gastric acid reducing agents (e.g., H2 antagonists, omeprazole), sulfonamides (e.g., sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, and sulfamethoxazole) and others (e.g., amiodarone, methylphenidate, and isoniazid).
Drugs that may reduce phenytoin blood levels include antiepileptic drugs (e.g., carbamazepine), antiviral agents (e.g., fosamprenavir, ritonavir), others (e.g., diazepam, rifampin, theophylline) and chronic alcohol abuse.
The oral absorption of phenytoin can be reduced by antacids containing magnesium, calcium carbonate, calcium salts, or enteral feeding products.

Many more drugs interact with phenytoin, so tell your healthcare practitioner about any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, supplements, or herbal products you take. Patients should not increase, decrease, or stop taking their medication without consulting with their healthcare provider as it can increase their risk of having a seizure and may affect other medications that they are taking.



","



The phenytoin test is used to optimize drug therapy, monitor the amount of phenytoin in the blood, determine whether drug concentrations are in the therapeutic range, and to monitor patient adherence.
It may be ordered every few days when a person first begins taking phenytoin to help adjust the dose to the desired blood level. The test is then ordered at regular intervals and as needed to monitor blood concentrations. One or more phenytoin tests may be ordered if a person starts or stops taking additional medications (to judge their effect, if any, on phenytoin levels) and may be ordered if the person has a seizure or if a healthcare practitioner suspects toxicity.
Under normal conditions, a total phenytoin test is appropriate for monitoring therapeutic levels because the balance between bound and unbound phenytoin in the blood is relatively stable.
In certain conditions and disease states (e.g., renal disease, low blood levels of albumin), a free phenytoin test may be considered. These conditions and disease states can lead to an increase of ""free"" phenytoin and thus patients may experience symptoms of toxicity even though their total phenytoin results fall within the therapeutic range.

To evaluate the level of phosphorus in your blood and to aid in the diagnosis of conditions known to cause abnormally high or low levels of phosphorus


","

A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. If a timed urine sample is required, you will be asked to save all of your urine over a set time period (usually 24 hours).


","



Phosphorus is a mineral that combines with other substances to form organic and inorganic phosphate compounds. The terms phosphorus and phosphate are often used interchangeably when talking about testing, but it is the amount of inorganic phosphate in the blood that is measured with a serum phosphorus/phosphate test.
Phosphates are vital for energy production, muscle and nerve function, and bone growth. They also play an important role as a buffer, helping to maintain the body's acid-base balance.
We get the phosphorus we need through the foods we eat. It is found in many foods and is readily absorbed by the digestive tract. Most of the body's phosphates combine with calcium to help form bones and teeth. Smaller amounts are found in muscle and nerve tissue. The rest is found within cells throughout the body, where they are mainly used to store energy.
Normally, only about 1% of total body phosphates are present in the blood.   A wide variety of foods, such as beans, peas and nuts, cereals, dairy products, eggs, beef, chicken, and fish, contain significant amounts of phosphorus. The body maintains phosphorus/phosphate levels in the blood by regulating how much it absorbs from the intestines and how much it excretes via the kidneys. Phosphate levels are also affected by the interaction of parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium, and vitamin D.
Phosphorus deficiencies (hypophosphatemia) may be seen with malnutrition, malabsorption, acid-base imbalances, increased blood calcium, and with disorders that affect kidney function. Phosphorus excesses (hyperphosphatemia) may be seen with increased intake of the mineral, low blood calcium, and with kidney dysfunction.
Someone with a mild to moderate phosphorus deficiency often does not have any symptoms. With a severe phosphorus deficiency, symptoms may include muscle weakness and confusion. An extreme excess of phosphorus may cause symptoms that are similar to those seen with low calcium, including muscle cramps, confusion, and even seizures.

In follow up to an abnormal calcium level; when you have a kidney disorder or uncontrolled diabetes; when you are taking calcium or phosphate supplements


","



Since mildly abnormal phosphorus levels usually cause no symptoms, phosphorus testing is typically performed in follow up to an abnormal calcium test and/or when symptoms of abnormal calcium such as fatigue, muscle weakness, cramping, or bone problems are present.
Phosphorus testing may also be ordered along with other tests when symptoms suggest kidney and gastrointestinal disorders.
When conditions causing abnormal phosphorus and/or calcium levels are found, testing for both may be ordered at regular intervals to monitor treatment effectiveness.
When someone has diabetes or signs of an acid-base imbalance, a healthcare practitioner may sometimes monitor phosphorus levels.



","



Low levels of phosphorus (hypophosphatemia) in the blood may be due to or associated with:

Increased blood calcium (hypercalcemia), especially due to hyperparathyroidism
Overuse of diuretics
Malnutrition
Alcoholism
Severe burns
Diabetic ketoacidosis (after treatment)
Hypothyroidism
Decreased blood potassium (hypokalemia)
Chronic antacid use 
Rickets and osteomalacia (due to vitamin D deficiencies)

Higher than normal levels of phosphorus (hyperphosphatemia) in the blood may be due to or associated with:

Kidney failure
Liver disease
Hypoparathyroidism
Diabetic ketoacidosis (when first seen)
Increased dietary intake (phosphate supplementation)




","



Abnormally high levels of phosphorus can lead to organ damage due to calcification, deposits of calcium phosphate in the tissues. This is rare, however, and it is more common that high phosphorus levels lead to cardiovascular disease or osteoporosis.
Phosphate levels are normally higher in children than in adults because their bones are actively growing. Low phosphate levels in children can inhibit bone growth and high levels may be an indication of a condition that disrupts the body's balance of minerals.
Soft drinks and pre-packaged food items are high in phosphorus content, which some nutritionists believe contributes to over-consumption of phosphorus.
Blood and urine levels of phosphorus may be affected by the use of enemas and laxatives containing sodium phosphate, excess dietary vitamin D supplements, and by intravenous glucose administration.



",,"



Phosphorus tests are most often ordered along with other tests, such as those for calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and/or vitamin D, to help diagnose and/or monitor treatment of various conditions that cause calcium and phosphorus imbalances.
While phosphorus tests are most commonly performed on blood samples, phosphorus is sometimes measured in urine samples to monitor its elimination by the kidneys.

plasma-free-metanephrines,['Plasma Metanephrines'],"

Blood for plasma metanephrine testing is collected by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm. Although you may be seated for the collection, it is recommended that you be lying down. The healthcare practitioner or the collection site will instruct you as to their specific requirements.
These tests are affected by certain drugs, foods, and stresses. Inform your healthcare practitioner of any medications you are taking and follow any preparation instructions you are given before sample collection.


","

To help diagnose or rule out a rare tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma or a rare tumor occurring outside the adrenal glands called a paraganglioma; these tumors (PPGL) produce excess hormones called catecholamines, which are broken down to metanephrines.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



The metanephrines - metanephrine and normetanephrine - are breakdown products (metabolites) of the catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. The plasma free metanephrines test measures the amount of metanephrine and normetanephrine in the blood.
Catecholamines are produced by the adrenal glands (as hormones), small triangular organs located on top of each kidney, and by cells of the sympathetic nervous system (called neurotransmitter substances or neurotransmitters). The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are released in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate small air passages in the lungs called bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, which increases blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism).
After completing their actions, catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Epinephrine breaks down into metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and norepinephrine becomes normetanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Catecholamines and their breakdown products are normally found in small fluctuating quantities in the blood and urine and only increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation.
However, rare tumors of the adrenal glands called pheochromocytomas and rare tumors that occur outside the adrenal glands called paragangliomas can produce large amounts of the hormones, resulting in significantly increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. (These syndromes are often grouped together and abbreviated as PPGL.) This can cause persistent or episodic periods of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and the symptoms may worsen. Over time, hypertension caused by the excess hormones may cause kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
Although they are rare, it is important to diagnose these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of catecholamine being produced and to eliminate their associated symptoms and complications.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Blood for plasma free metanephrines testing is collected by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Although you may be seated for the collection, it is recommended that you be lying down. Your healthcare practitioner or the collection site will instruct you as to their specific requirements.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Catecholamine levels and by extension the levels of their metabolites are affected by various drugs, foods, and stresses. Preparation for the test is important to ensure that an appropriate sample is collected and for correct interpretation of results. Follow any instructions given by your healthcare practitioner or the collection site or laboratory.

You should talk to your healthcare provider about any prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs and supplements that you are taking. It may be necessary to discontinue medications for some time prior to the test.
However, you should not stop taking any medications without consulting your healthcare provider. Your healthcare practitioner will work with you to identify potentially interfering substances and drug treatments and to determine which of them can be safely interrupted and which must be continued for your well-being.
You will also be instructed on what foods to avoid. Fasting may also be required prior to the sample being drawn.
Avoid emotional and physical stresses and vigorous exercise prior to and during sample collection as they can increase catecholamine release and therefore affect metanephrine levels.

When your healthcare provider either suspects that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines or wants to rule out the possibility; when you (especially if you are younger than age 40) have sudden bursts (paroxysms) of signs and symptoms, such as high blood pressure (especially if it doesn't respond to standard treatment), severe headaches, rapid heart rate (palpitations), sweating, tremors and flushing; when you have a hereditary (genetic) risk for developing PPGL; when a tumor has been treated or removed, to monitor for recurrence; occasionally, when an adrenal tumor is detected by chance, such as during an imaging test for another condition


","



The plasma free metanephrines test is primarily ordered when your healthcare practitioner either suspects that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines or wants to rule out the possibility. It may be ordered when you (especially if you are younger than age 40) have sudden bursts (paroxysms) of signs and symptoms, such as:

High blood pressure (hypertension), especially when you have hypertension that is not responding to treatment (people with these tumors are frequently resistant to standard therapies)
Severe headaches
Excessive sweating
Flushing
Rapid heart rate (palpitations)
Tremor

Testing may also be ordered when a tumor that releases catecholamines has been treated or removed to monitor for recurrence.
Occasionally, the test may be ordered when an adrenal tumor is detected incidentally, such as during a scan conducted for another purpose, or when you have an inherited (genetic) risk or family history of pheochromocytomas.



","



Normal metanephrine and normetanephrine blood levels mean it is unlikely that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines. The plasma free metanephrines test is very sensitive and these tumors are rare, making it the best test for excluding PPGL.
High levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine when you have signs and symptoms suggest the presence of a tumor. It is recommended that patients with a positive result receive appropriate follow-up according to the test values noted and the clinical presentation. Imaging scans, such as MRI, should be done to locate the tumor.
If levels are elevated after you have been treated for one of these tumors, it may be an indication that the treatment was not fully effective or that the tumor is recurring and appropriate follow-up is needed.
The test for metanephrines is very sensitive and false positives do occur. The test is affected by stress, drugs, smoking and various foods. If you have only moderately elevated metanephrines, then your healthcare provider may re-evaluate your medications, diet, and stress level to look for interfering substances or conditions. Once these are resolved, you may be tested again to determine whether the metanephrines are still elevated. Sometimes the plasma free metanephrines test will be done along with 24-hour urine metanephrines testing and/or followed by catecholamines testing or imaging procedures to help decide if a catecholamine-secreting tumor is present.



","



While the plasma free metanephrines test can help detect and diagnose the presence of a tumor that produces catecholamines, it cannot tell the healthcare provider the location of the tumor or whether it is benign or malignant (although most are benign). Imaging studies may be used to locate the tumor and genetic testing may be used to determine potential malignancy.
About 25% of PPGL occur in the setting of a hereditary syndrome associated with alterations in specific genes. These genetic syndromes have thus been identified as carrying an increased tumor risk. Examples include von Hippel-Lindau [VHL] disease and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [MEN2] syndrome. (For more information on these, see Genetics Home Reference: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia.)



",,"



The plasma free metanephrines test is used to help diagnose or rule out the presence of a rare tumor called a pheochromocytoma or a paraganglioma (PPGL) that releases excess metanephrines. Testing also may be used when a tumor has been treated or removed to monitor for recurrence.
The Endocrine Society, the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, and the European Society of Endocrinology have released clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. The guidelines recommend using a test for plasma free metanephrines or urine metanephrines to evaluate an individual for PPGL.

The blood test may be most useful when you have persistent hypertension or are currently experiencing a sudden burst (paroxysm) of hypertension. This is because the hormones do not stay long in the blood; they are used by the body and rapidly broken down (metabolized) and/or then eliminated.
Urine testing measures the total amount of metanephrines released into the urine in 24 hours. Since the hormone levels may fluctuate significantly during this period, the urine test may detect excess production that is missed with a blood test.

However, your healthcare practitioner may select any one (or more than one) of these tests depending on your signs and symptoms, family history, and/or genetic profile.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or by a fingerstick (children and adults) or heelstick (newborns)


","



Platelets, also called thrombocytes, are tiny fragments of cells that are essential for normal blood clotting. They are formed from very large cells called megakaryocytes in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate. The platelet count is a test that determines the number of platelets in your sample of blood.
When there is an injury to a blood vessel or tissue and bleeding begins, platelets help stop bleeding in three ways. They:

Adhere to the injury site
Clump together (aggregate) with other platelets
Release chemical compounds that stimulate aggregation of other platelets

These steps result in the formation of a loose platelet plug at the site of the injury in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This secondary hemostasis process results in the formation of strands of fibrin that weave through the loose platelet plug, form a fibrin net, and compress to form a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed. When the clot is no longer needed, other factors break the clot down and remove it.
Each component of the clotting process must be present, activated at the right time, and functioning properly for adequate clotting. If there is an insufficient number of platelets or if the platelets are not functioning normally, a stable clot may not form and you may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding.
Platelets survive in the circulation about 8 to 10 days, so the bone marrow must continually produce new platelets to replace those that degrade, are used up, and/or are lost through bleeding. Determining the number of platelets in blood with a platelet count can help diagnose a range of disorders having to do with too few or too many platelets.

As part of a routine complete blood count (CBC); when you have episodes of unexplained or prolonged bleeding or other symptoms that may be due to a platelet disorder


","



A platelet count is often ordered as a part of a complete blood count (CBC) when you have a routine health exam.
It may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms associated with low platelets or a bleeding disorder, such as:

Unexplained or easy bruising
Prolonged bleeding from a small cut or wound
Numerous nosebleeds
Bleeding in the digestive tract (blood may be present in stool, which may be dark black)
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Small red spots on the skin called petechiae—may sometimes look like a rash
Small purplish spots on the skin called purpura, caused by bleeding under the skin

Testing may also be done when it is suspected that you have too many platelets (thrombocytosis). This can cause excessive clotting or sometimes bleeding if the platelets are not functioning properly. However, you may have no signs or symptoms if you have increased platelets, so the condition may be found only when a platelet count is done as part of a health exam or for another condition.



","



Your platelet count is interpreted by your healthcare practitioner within the context of other tests that you have had done (e.g., CBC) as well as other factors, such as your medical history.
A single low or high platelet count may or may not have medical significance. Generally, this is the case when the result is only slightly lower or higher than the reference (normal) range. Your healthcare practitioner may repeat the test and may look at results from prior platelet counts. On the other hand, a result outside the reference range may indicate a problem and warrant further investigation. Your healthcare practitioner will determine whether a result that falls outside of the reference range means something significant for you.
A low platelet count, also called thrombocytopenia, along with other certain signs and symptoms, may be caused by a number of conditions and factors. The causes typically fall into one of two general categories:

Disorders in which the bone marrow cannot produce enough platelets
Conditions in which platelets are used up (consumed) or destroyed faster than the bone marrow can produce them

(For additional details, read the article on Low Platelets.)
Examples of conditions and factors causing a low platelet count include:

Idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP), also known as immune thrombocytopenic purpura, is the result of antibody production against platelets.
Viral infections such as mononucleosis, hepatitis, HIV, or measles
Use of certain drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, some antibiotics (including those containing sulfa), colchicine and indomethacin, H2-blocking agents, hydralazine, isoniazid, quinidine, thiazide diuretics, and tolbutamide; these are just a few that have been associated with drug-induced decreased platelet counts.
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) results in low platelets when you are or have been treated with heparin and you develop an antibody. (For more on this, see the article on HIT Antibody.)
Leukemia, lymphoma, or another cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the bone marrow—people with cancers often experience excessive bleeding due to a significantly decreased number of platelets. As the number of cancer cells increases in the bone marrow, normal bone marrow cells are crowded out, resulting in fewer platelet-producing cells.
Aplastic anemia—a condition in which the production of all blood cells is significantly reduced
Sepsis, especially sepsis caused by a serious Gram-negative bacterial infection
Cirrhosis
Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, where the body's immune system produces antibodies that attack its own organs or tissues, causing increased destruction of platelets
Chemotherapy or radiation therapy, which may affect the bone marrow's ability to produce platelets
Platelets may be used up quickly in serious conditions, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).
Bone marrow damage caused by exposure to toxic chemicals, such as certain pesticides or benzene
Excessive alcohol drinking, especially in heavy drinkers who are low in iron, vitamin B12 or folate
A number of congenital (genetic) syndromes that result in a decreased number of platelets

When a platelet count is below 50,000, bleeding is more serious if you're cut or bruised. If the platelet count falls below 10,000 to 20,000 per microliter, spontaneous bleeding may occur and is considered a life-threatening risk. If you have a very low platelet count, you may be given platelets through a transfusion. (See Blood and Blood Components in the Transfusion Medicine article for more details.)
A high platelet count may be referred to as thrombocytosis. This is usually the result of an existing condition (also called secondary or reactive thrombocytosis), such as:

Cancer, most commonly lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or lymphoma
Anemia, in particular, iron-deficiency anemia and hemolytic anemia
Inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or rheumatoid arthritis
Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis
If you have had your spleen removed surgically
Use of birth control pills (oral contraceptives)

Some conditions may cause a temporary increased platelet count. These may include:

Recovery from significant blood loss, such as from trauma or major surgery
After physical activity or exertion
Recovery from excess alcohol consumption and vitamin B12 and folate deficiency

Rarely, thrombocytosis is caused by a bone marrow disorder. An example is thrombocythemia, also called primary or essential thrombocythemia, a rare myeloproliferative disorder in which the bone marrow produces an extremely high number of platelets. Often there are no signs and symptoms and the condition is discovered when testing is done for a health check or for other reasons.
Individuals who have this condition may be at risk of excessive clotting (thrombosis) due to the excess number of platelets but may also experience bleeding problems due to platelets not functioning normally. This disorder is often associated with a mutation in the gene called JAK2. A test for this mutation should be performed if a healthcare practitioner suspects that you have the disorder. More than half of the people with essential thrombocythemia have the JAK2 mutation. People with other myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disorder, such as chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, or certain subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome, may also have markedly higher platelet counts.



","



Some people have platelets that tend to ""pool"" or collect (sequester) in their spleen, resulting in a low platelet count. However, these individuals typically do not experience any signs or symptoms related to this condition.
Living in high altitudes, strenuous exercise, and having recently delivered a baby (post partum) may cause increased platelet numbers. Drugs that may cause increased platelet counts include estrogen and birth control pills (oral contraceptives).
Mildly decreased platelet counts may be seen in women before menstruation. Between 7% and 12% of pregnant women may have a lower platelet count at term.
Inherited disorders caused by genetic defects in platelets include Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier disease, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, May-Hegglin syndrome, and Down syndrome. The occurrence of these genetic abnormalities, however, is relatively rare.



","



A platelet count is used to determine the number of platelets in your blood. The test is included in a complete blood count (CBC), a panel of tests often performed as part of a general health exam.
A platelet count may be used:

To screen for or diagnose various diseases and conditions that can cause problems with blood clot formation. It may be used as part of the workup of a bleeding disorder, bone marrow disease, or excessive clotting disorder, to name just a few.
As a monitoring tool if you have an underlying condition, are being treated for a platelet disorder, or are undergoing treatment with drugs known to affect platelets.

A platelet count may be performed in conjunction with tests that evaluate coagulation, such as PT and PTT. A blood smear may be done in follow up to examine the platelets using a microscope. This would help confirm whether platelets might truly be low in number or have clumped together, in addition to assessing their appearance with regards to size and granularity.

Platelets (also known as thrombocytes) are small, round cellular fragments that are vital for normal blood clotting. Platelet function tests indirectly evaluate how well a person's platelets work in helping to stop bleeding within the body.
Platelets are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the blood. When there is an injury to a blood vessel and bleeding begins, platelets are the first elements to help to stop bleeding. They do so in three ways. They:

Adhere to the injury site
Clump together (aggregate) with other platelets, forming a temporary plug
Release compounds that stimulate further aggregation and the eventual formation of a blood clot

These reactions result in the formation of a loose platelet plug in a process called primary hemostasis. At the same time, activated platelets support the coagulation cascade, a series of steps that involves the sequential activation of proteins called clotting factors. This is called secondary hemostasis and the two processes result in the formation of a stable clot that remains in place until the injury has healed.
If there are insufficient platelets or if they are not functioning normally in any of the three main ways, a stable clot may not form and a person may be at an increased risk of excessive bleeding. The number of platelets in blood can be determined with a platelet count and can help diagnose disorders having to do with too many or too few platelets. However, the overall ability of platelets to function properly in the body is more difficult to measure.
Platelet function tests are a group of assays that use specialized equipment to measure the ability of platelets to aggregate and promote clotting in a sample of blood. There are a variety of tests available but no one test that identifies all problems with platelet function. Also, there is no widespread agreement on which test(s) is best for each circumstance.
In addition to evaluating people for excessive bleeding, platelet function tests may be used in other situations. There are situations in which it is desirable to decrease the ability of platelets to aggregate, as in for people who are at an increased risk of developing a dangerous blood clot or at increased risk for heart attacks. These people may be prescribed medications that reduce platelet activation or reduce their ability to aggregate. People on these types of anti-platelet medications, such as low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel, may have platelet function tests done as a way of monitoring their treatment. However, there is currently no consensus among medical experts on the usefulness of platelet function tests in anti-platelet therapy.
Screening Tests
Bleeding time
In the past, the primary screen for platelet dysfunction was the bleeding time or the standardized bleeding time. This was the only test that directly measured platelet function within the body. It involves making two small, shallow, standardized cuts on the inner forearm and measuring the amount of time for bleeding to stop. The bleeding time procedure has fallen from favor in recent years. Many hospitals no longer offer it and several national organizations have issued position statements against its routine use. The bleeding time is not sensitive or specific and it does not necessarily reflect the risk or severity of surgical bleeding. It is poorly reproducible, can be affected by aspirin use and by the skill of the person performing the test, and frequently leaves small, thin scars on the forearm.
Closure time assays
This test measures the time required for the platelets in a sample of blood to plug a small hole in a tiny tube after being exposed to various activating substances. This is called the closure time. Prolonged closure times indicate lower platelet function but do not identify the cause. This test may be abnormal if the platelet count is low, if platelet function is reduced, if other proteins needed for platelet function are reduced, or if anti-platelet medications are present. This type of assay can be used to screen for von Willebrand disease and some platelet function disorders, but it will not detect all platelet function disorders, particularly the milder forms. This test is relatively simple to perform and is available in many healthcare facilities. Further testing would need to be performed in order to identify the exact cause of any abnormal results.
Viscoelastometry (or Thromboelastometry)
Blood clots have to be strong to stop bleeding and prevent new bleeding until healing can occur. This type of testing is designed to determine the strength of a blood clot as it forms. It is most often performed in larger hospitals, either in the operating room as a point-of-care test or in the clinical laboratory.
Endpoint bead or endpoint platelet aggregation assays
These assays determine the number of coated beads or platelets that aggregate after substances are added to activate platelets in a sample of blood. They provide a single measure of aggregation (an endpoint) rather than a measure of aggregation over time. More platelets aggregating or sticking to beads indicates better platelet function. These tests may be abnormal if the platelet count is low, if platelet function is reduced, or if anti-platelet medications are present.
Platelet count ratio
The number of platelets are measured in an initial sample. A substance is added to the sample to activate the platelets and cause them to aggregate. The number of platelets is measured again – only those that have not aggregated will be counted the second time. The difference between the first measurement and the second measurement is an indication of platelet function.
Diagnostic Tests
Platelet aggregometry
Many different substances can activate a platelet, including proteins in the wound, factors released from other activated platelets, and factors produced by the coagulation system that aids platelets in forming a strong plug to stop bleeding. Many different platelet abnormalities have been described due to problems with one or more of these activating systems. Platelet aggregometry consists of 4 to 8 separate tests. In each test, a different platelet activating substance (agonist) is added to blood, followed by measurement of platelet aggregation over several minutes. When complete, the entire panel of tests is reviewed and interpreted to determine if there is any evidence of abnormal platelet function. Platelet aggregation testing is the gold standard in platelet function testing and can diagnose a variety of inherited and acquired platelet function disorders. It is typically performed at academic medical centers or large hospitals due to the complexity of the testing and interpretation.
Lumiaggregometry
Similar to platelet aggregometry, lumiaggregometry simultaneously measures the release of certain organic agents from platelet granules (little sacs within the platelet) utilizing a luminescence technique. This technique measures the amount of light emitted when activating substances are added, that results in the conversion of ADP (adenosine diphosphate) to ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This measurement reflects any abnormalities that may be present in platelet granules, a problem with patients with 'storage pool defects' that are often seen in grey platelet syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
Flow cytometry
Platelets can be evaluated for functional defects using flow cytometry. This test uses lasers to determine proteins that are present on the platelet surface and how they change when the platelet is activated. Platelet flow cytometry is a highly specialized procedure available only in a few university hospital and reference laboratories to diagnose inherited platelet function disorders.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is drawn though a needle from a vein in the arm. Due to critical time constraints related to platelet activation/ function, you may be sent directly to the laboratory performing the tests. If you have a history of excessive bleeding, you should inform the healthcare practitioner drawing your blood.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
In general, no test preparation is needed. However, you may be instructed to refrain from taking drugs that can affect the results of these tests, such as aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any over-the-counter medications that contain drugs such as these. The most common NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, and COX-2 inhibitors. (See MedlinePlus Drugs & Supplements for more information on drugs, drug ingredients, and brand names.) However, do not stop taking your medications unless instructed to do so by your healthcare practitioner.

When you bruise easily or experience excessive or prolonged bleeding from minor cuts, nose or gums, or excessive menstrual bleeding; when you are taking medications that can alter platelet function; prior to or during certain surgeries; if you have a family member with a history of excessive bleeding


","



One or more platelet function tests are ordered whenever a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate platelet function. This may be:

When a person is experiencing symptoms of platelet dysfunction, such as excessive bleeding; these include easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding gums, excessive bleeding during dental procedures, etc.
Prior to surgery or other invasive procedure
During surgery, especially prolonged procedures
When a person is taking a medication that can have an effect on platelet function




","



The interpretation of results of the various types of platelet function tests depends on why the tests were performed.
In the investigation of excessive bleeding or the potential for bleeding during surgery, abnormal results may indicate the presence of a platelet disorder. Testing for coagulation factor deficiencies or abnormalities (bleeding disorder tests) in addition to clinical evaluation is often necessary to identify an inherited disorder or acquired condition as the cause of the dysfunction. Often, family studies may be required to determine if the abnormality is inherited or acquired.
Examples of inherited platelet function disorders include:

Von Willebrand disease – decreased production or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor results in reduced platelet adherence to the injured blood vessel and increased blood loss
Glanzmann's thrombasthenia – affects platelets' ability to aggregate
Bernard-Soulier syndrome – characterized by reduced platelet adhesion
Storage pool disease – can affect platelets' ability to release substances that promote aggregation

Acquired platelet dysfunction – those that are not inherited – may be due to chronic conditions such as:

Kidney failure (uremia)
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
Certain leukemias (chronic myeloid leukemia or CML; acute myeloid leukemia or AML)

Some acquired platelet disorders that are temporary include:

Decreased function due to medications like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
Abnormal function after prolonged cardiac bypass surgery

When a person is on an anti-platelet medication, such as aspirin, the results of testing reflect the platelet response to the medication.



","



Platelet function testing is not a perfect reflection of the clotting process in the body (in vivo). A person with normal platelet function test results may still experience excessive bleeding or inappropriate clotting during and after a surgery.
Most samples for platelet function testing are only stable for a very short period of time. Testing choices are often limited to what is locally available.
There are several drugs that can affect the results of platelet function tests. Some of these include:

Aspirin and aspirin-containing compounds (salicylates)
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and any over-the-counter medications that contain NSAIDs
Tricyclic antidepressants
Antihistamines
Some antibiotics
Some supplements (including garlic, turmeric, cumin, gingko biloba)

Various platelet function tests are used to evaluate the ability of platelets to clump together and begin to form a clot. They may be used for a variety of reasons. Examples of some of the situations in which they may be used include:

To identify and help diagnose platelet dysfunction in those with a history of excessive bleeding. It is in this area that platelet function tests are of the most use. They can be used to screen for dysfunction and, along with other bleeding disorder tests, to help diagnose inherited and acquired platelet dysfunctions. von Willebrand disease, for instance, is the most common inherited disorder that is assoicated with platelet dysfunction. Decreased production or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF) results in reduced platelet adherence to the injured blood vessel and increased blood loss.
To monitor platelet function during complex surgical procedures, including cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, cardiac catheterization, liver transplantation, and trauma surgery. For example, those undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery are given anticoagulants to reduce blood clotting, resulting in an increased risk of excessive bleeding. At the same time, bypassing the heart and mechanically circulating the blood activates large numbers of platelets and causes them to become dysfunctional. Monitoring the number of platelets in blood (platelet count) during cardiac surgery also helps the healthcare practitioners maintain a delicate balance between bleeding and clotting.
To screen at-risk pre-surgical patients who have a personal or family history of bleeding. Healthcare practitioners currently evaluate a person for known risk factors and rely on the person's clinical history and results of other coagulation tests such as PT and PTT to determine the overall risk of excessive bleeding. There is no single platelet function screening test that will definitively predict which people are likely to bleed during surgery. Interestingly, studies have shown that platelet function tests are not useful for predicting bleeding risk in people taking anti-platelet medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
To monitor anti-platelet therapy given to some people after a stroke or heart attack to help inhibit blood clotting. Currently, most anti-platelet therapies are not routinely monitored with platelet function testing. As more anti-platelet therapies are created, it is anticipated that additional methods will be developed to monitor them.
To detect aspirin resistance. Low-dose aspirin is being prescribed as an anti-platelet therapy to many people who have had a cardiovascular incident, such as a heart attack or stroke. Some people on this therapy who have another heart attack are thought to have aspirin resistance. At present, aspirin resistance is a somewhat vague term, with no consensus on its definition, how many people are affected by it, or on how to measure it. There are questions as to whether testing can predict what will happen in an individual person, whether the resistance will persist or be transient, and whether it is also associated with resistance to other anti-platelet therapies such as clopidogrel. While these tests are becoming more widely available and easy to perform, there is still lack of agreement on how to alter therapy based on the results. Most agree that there is still much work to be done on determining its clinical relevance.

Platelet function testing may include one or more of the following:

Closure time assay
Viscoelastometry
Bleeding time
Platelet aggregometry/Lumiaggregometry
Flow cytometry

For a more detailed explanation of these tests, read the ""What is being tested?"" section.
Some other tests that may be done in conjunction with or as follow up to platelet function tests to evaluate platelet disorders include complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, PT, PTT, D-dimer, and von Willebrand factor (vWF).

","

To help diagnose the cause of accumulation of fluid in your chest cavity (pleural effusion)


","

A volume of pleural fluid collected using a procedure called thoracentesis (see Common Questions)


","



The exterior surface of your lungs and thoracic cavity are lined with continuous membrane known as the pleura. Pleural fluid is layered between the two surfaces so that the opposing surfaces with ""glide"" across each other during breathing. This ""gliding"" movement helps with normal breathing. In healthy individuals, there is about 10 to 20 milliliters of pleural fluid that is evenly distributed across the pleura and it is continually replenished from the blood in the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) in your lungs. Certain diseases will increase the pleural volume, usually as a pocket or collection. In these cases, it should be tested and, if necessary, drained.
A variety of conditions and diseases can cause inflammation of these membranes (pleuritis) and/or excessive buildup of pleural fluid (pleural effusion). Pleural fluid testing evaluates this liquid to determine the cause of the increased fluid.
The two main reasons for fluid buildup in the pleural space are:

An imbalance between the pressure of the liquid within your blood vessels, which drives fluid out of blood vessels, and the amount of protein in your blood, which keeps fluid in blood vessels. The fluid that accumulates in this case is called a transudate. This type of fluid more commonly involves both sides of your chest and is most frequently a result of either congestive heart failure or cirrhosis.
An injury to or inflammation of the pleurae, in which case the fluid that accumulates is called an exudate. It more commonly involves one side of your chest. Exudates are associated with a variety of conditions and diseases, including:
	
Infections—caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Infections may start in the pleurae or spread there from other places in your body. For example, pleuritis and pleural effusion may occur along with or following pneumonia.
Bleeding—bleeding disorders, trauma, or blockage in a lung artery (pulmonary embolism) can lead to blood in your pleural fluid.
Inflammatory conditions—such as lung diseases, chronic lung inflammation for example due to prolonged exposure to large amounts of asbestos (asbestosis), sarcoidosis, or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
Malignancies—such as lymphoma, leukemias, lung cancer, metastatic cancers
Other conditions—examples include unknown (idiopathic), heart bypass surgery, heart or lung transplantation, pancreatitis, or abscesses within the abdomen



Determining the type of fluid present is important because it helps to shorten the list of possible causes of your pleural effusion. Healthcare practitioners and laboratory professionals use an initial set of tests (cell count, protein, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) level, and appearance of the fluid) to distinguish between transudates and exudates; part of this evaluation is collection of a blood specimen to compare levels between blood and effusion. If the fluid is an exudate, additional tests may be performed to further pinpoint the disease or condition causing your pleuritis and/or pleural effusion.

","



Pleural fluid testing may be ordered when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you have pleuritis and/or pleural effusion after confirmation with a chest x-ray. It may be ordered when you have some combination of the following signs and symptoms:

Chest pain that worsens with deep breathing
Coughing
Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath
Fever, chills
Fatigue




","



Test results can help distinguish between types of pleural fluid and help diagnose the cause of your fluid accumulation. The initial set of tests performed on a sample of your pleural fluid helps determine whether the fluid is a transudate or exudate:



Fluid Appearance
Protein, Albumin or LD Level
Cell Count
Type of Fluid
Cause


Clear
Low
Few cells
Transudate
CHF or cirrhosis


May be cloudy
High
Increased
Exudate
Several possible causes, additional tests needed



If the fluid is an exudate, additional test results and their associated causes may include:
Fluid appearance – pleural fluid is usually light yellow and clear. Abnormal results may give clues to the conditions or diseases present. Examples include:

Reddish pleural fluid may indicate the presence of blood.
Cloudy, thick pleural fluid may indicate an infection and/or the presence of white blood cells. It may also indicate leakage of fluid from the lymphatic system (lymph). Lymph drains from the lymphatic system into the venous system in the chest and either trauma or lymphoma can cause lymph to be present in pleural fluid.

Chemical tests – tests performed in addition to protein or albumin may include the following, although the evidence on their usefulness is not clear:

Glucose—typically about the same as blood glucose levels; may be lower with infection and rheumatoid arthritis.
Lactate levels can increase with infections.
Amylase levels may increase with pancreatitis, esophageal rupture, or malignancy.
Triglyceride levels may be increased when there is a leak from your lymphatic system.
Tumor markers, such as CEA, may be increased with some cancers.

Microscopic examination – normal pleural fluid has small numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) but no red blood cells (RBCs) or microorganisms.

Total cell counts—increased WBCs may be seen with infections and other causes of pleuritis. Increased RBCs may suggest trauma, malignancy, or pulmonary infarction.
WBC differential—identifies different types of WBCs present; an increased number of neutrophils may be seen with bacterial infections. An increased number of lymphocytes may be seen with cancers and tuberculosis.
Cytology—a cytocentrifuged sample is treated with a special stain and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells. This is often done when a mesothelioma or metastatic cancer is suspected. The presence of certain abnormal cells, such as tumor cells or immature blood cells, can indicate what type of cancer is involved.

Infectious disease tests:

Gram stain—there should be no organisms present in your pleural fluid.
Bacterial culture and susceptibility testing—if bacteria are present, susceptibility testing can be performed to guide your antimicrobial therapy. If there are no bacteria present, it does not rule out an infection; they may be present in small numbers or their growth may be inhibited because of prior antibiotic therapy.
Fungal tests—if a culture is positive, the fungus or fungi causing your infection will be identified in the report and susceptibility testing may be done to guide therapy.
Adenosine deaminase—a markedly elevated level in your pleural fluid when you have symptoms that suggest tuberculosis means it is likely that you have a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This is especially true if you live in an area where tuberculosis is common. (For more details, see the test article on Adenosine Deaminase.)

Other less common tests for infections may be performed and may identify, for example, a virus, the mycobacterium that causes tuberculosis, or a parasite as the cause.

A blood glucose, protein, albumin, or LD test may be ordered to compare levels with those in your pleural fluid.

Pleural fluid testing is used to help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup in your chest cavity (pleural effusion). An initial set of tests typically includes:

Fluid protein, albumin, or LD level
Cell count
Fluid appearance

Results from these are compared to results from a blood specimen to determine whether the fluid is a transudate or an exudate.

Transudate—this is most frequently caused by congestive heart failure or cirrhosis. If the fluid is determined to be a transudate, then usually no more tests on the fluid are necessary.
Exudate—additional testing is often ordered to diagnose the cause and may include:
	
Tests to measure pleural fluid glucose, lactate, amylase, triglyceride levels and tests for tumor markers such as CEA may be done, though the usefulness of these tests is not clear.
Microscopic examination – a laboratory professional places a sample of your fluid on a slide and examines it using a microscope, counting any white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) and looking for bacteria or fungi.
Cytology – a laboratory professional may use a special centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) to concentrate your fluid's cells on a slide. The slide is treated with a special stain and evaluated for abnormal cells, such as malignant cells (cancer cells).

To help diagnose acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a type of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); to help guide and/or monitor treatment of APL or to monitor for leukemia cells that remain after treatment (minimal residual disease) or for disease recurrence


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a bone marrow sample collected using a bone marrow aspiration procedure


","



Promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha or PML-RARA refers to an abnormal fusion gene sequence. It is a specific rearrangement of genetic material from two separate chromosomes (chromosomal translocation) and is associated with a specific type of leukemia. This test detects and measures PML-RARA in the blood or bone marrow to determine if an individual has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Humans normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes, including 22 pairs of non-sex-determining chromosomes (also known as autosomes) and 1 pair of sex chromosomes (XX for females, XY for males). The genetic makeup of a person is contained on her/his chromosomes. The genes that reside on chromosomes form the blueprints for the production of thousands of proteins. Sometimes changes can occur to a person's chromosomes and/or genes during their lifetime because of exposures to radiation, toxins, or for unknown reasons. These exposures could lead to gene mutations or to chromosome translocations.
The PML-RARA fusion gene sequence is one such acquired change (mutation) that is formed when pieces of chromosome 15 and chromosome 17 break off and switch places (translocate). The PML gene region in chromosome 15 then fuses with the RARA gene region in chromosome 17. This is referred to as reciprocal translocation, and this particular one is commonly expressed as t(15;17).
Normally, the PML gene codes for a protein that helps prevent uncontrolled cell growth and acts as a tumor suppressor. The RARA gene codes for a protein that is crucial for white blood cell (WBC) maturation, as these cells typically develop through several stages in the bone marrow before release into circulation. The mutated PML-RARA fusion gene codes for an abnormal fusion protein that does neither of these functions but instead leads to the uncontrolled production and accumulation of leukemic WBCs that do not mature or differentiate beyond the promyelocyte stage. As a large number of these abnormal cells start to crowd out the normal blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, signs and symptoms of leukemia start to emerge.
Up to 98% of cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic t(15;17) PML-RARA reciprocal chromosomal translocation. In about 2% of APL cases, other translocations involving the RARA gene and genes other than PML have been reported.
Testing detects the PML-RARA fusion gene or its transcripts, the RNA copies made by the cell from the abnormal gene sequence of DNA. The presence of the PML-RARA abnormality helps confirm the diagnosis of APL.
Testing can also direct APL therapy and monitor minimal residual disease, which could be fatal. Treatment of APL typically involves all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a drug that binds to retinoic acid receptors in cells. The drug can overcome the effect of the abnormal PML-RARA protein and induce downstream signaling and maturation of WBCs. This therapy works well in conjunction with chemotherapy but only in those cases where the PML-RARA fusion gene is present. The treatment results in remission in about 80-90% of these patients, according to the American Cancer Society. A small percentage of people with APL have a fusion between the RARA gene and a different gene, and they may or may not benefit from ATRA therapy based upon the specific gene involved.

When you have results of a complete blood count (CBC) and/or signs and symptoms that suggest that you may have leukemia; periodically when you are being treated for APL and/or when you are in remission but need follow up


","



Testing is ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has APL. Initial testing may be indicated when a person has abnormal findings on a complete blood count (CBC) and/or blood smear such as an increased or decreased number of white blood cells, decreased platelets, decreased red blood cells, and abnormal, immature white blood cells called leukemic promyelocytes, and nonspecific symptoms that may be related to leukemia such as:

Fatigue or weakness
Pale skin (pallor)
Unexplained weight loss
Joint or bone pain and/or an enlarged spleen
Excessive bleeding, bruising, or inappropriate blood clotting

Early in APL, a person may have few or no symptoms. As time passes and normal blood cells are crowded out of the bone marrow and the number of abnormal leukemic cells increases, a person may experience anemia, prolonged bleeding, and recurrent infections. Those with APL may experience both bleeding and inappropriate clotting if they develop disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a potentially life-threatening complication of APL. Once APL has been diagnosed, PML-RARA molecular testing is ordered periodically to monitor the response to treatment and monitor for leukemic cells that remain after treatment (minimal residual disease) or for disease recurrence.
A standard cytogenetic analysis may sometimes be ordered when a PML-RARA gene sequence is not detected and the healthcare practitioner suspects another rearrangement involving the RARA gene may be present.



","



If a person has abnormal promyelocytes in the blood and bone marrow and has the PML-RARA gene sequence, then the person is diagnosed as having APL.
The presence of PML-RARA means the individual will likely benefit from treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). This is a drug that can help promyelocytic leukemia cells to continue to differentiate and become more mature. ATRA is typically effective in those cases where the PML-RARA fusion gene is present. A small percentage of people with APL have a fusion between RARA and a different gene, and they may or may not benefit from ATRA therapy depending upon the partner gene involved.
When monitoring treatment, a decrease in the amount of PML-RARA in the blood or bone marrow over time means the person is responding to treatment. If the number of cells that have PML-RARA drops below the test's detection limit and the person's blood cell counts are normal, then the person is considered to be in remission. An increase in PML-RARA levels over time indicates disease progression or relapse.
If a person with APL is not positive for the PML-RARA gene sequence, then that person may not be given ATRA therapy and PML-RARA molecular testing cannot be used to monitor the person.



","



Both blood and bone marrow may be evaluated as part of the initial diagnosis, but follow-up monitoring is often performed on blood samples. There is significant test variability among laboratories using different test methods. Therefore, for a given person with APL, PML-RARA molecular testing should be done by the same laboratory, if possible. Rising and falling levels of PML-RARA are usually more important than a single test result.



",,"



This testing is used to detect the abnormal promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha or PML-RARA gene sequence. It is used to help diagnose acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which the PML-RARA gene sequence is present, to guide treatment, to monitor response to treatment, and to monitor for disease recurrence.
A few different test methods are available to evaluate for PML-RARA, and they may be used for various purposes:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be used to help diagnose APL and/or help to determine the percentage of a person's blood or bone marrow cells that contain the abnormal, fused PML-RARA gene. This test method uses fluorescent dye-labeled probes to ""light up"" the PML-RARA gene sequence when it is present. FISH can also be used to detect the variant translocations involving RARA and genes other than PML. This may help identify drug-resistant (ATRA-resistant) rearrangements.
A molecular test (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RQ-PCR) may be ordered to help establish the initial diagnosis of APL. The PML-RARA PCR test is quantitative, that is, it provides a general estimate of the number of PML-RARA gene sequences present in a person's blood and/or bone marrow samples. A PML-RARA PCR test is typically ordered at the time of the initial diagnosis to establish a baseline value and then periodically to monitor a person's response to treatment and, if the person achieves remission, to monitor for recurrence. PCR will only detect the PML-RARA fusion, not the more rare combination of RARA with another gene.
Chromosome analysis (standard cytogenetic analysis) to detect chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., translocations or deletions, or gain or loss of chromosome) may help diagnose APL. This test method involves the evaluation of a person's chromosomes under a microscope to detect structural and/or numerical abnormalities. Cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are examined to determine if the PML-RARA t(15;17) chromosome translocation is present. This method can detect the more rare combination of RARA with a gene other than PML, so it may be used if one of the other test methods is negative but APL is still strongly suspected.

PML-RARA testing is often performed along with other blood and/or bone marrow tests if a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has leukemia and is trying to diagnose or rule out APL. Some of these other tests may include:

Complete blood count (CBC)—evaluates the number of each type of blood cell
Differential—identifies and counts different types of white blood cells
Blood smear—blood cells are examined under a microscope
Immunophenotyping—classifies cells according to the markers (antigens) on the surfaces of cells

To help diagnose and sometimes to monitor porphyrias


","

The sample type depends on the porphyrin tests ordered by the healthcare practitioner. It may include one or more of the following:

A blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein
A random or 24-hour urine collection (urine must be protected from light during collection)
A fresh stool sample that is not contaminated with urine or water



","



Porphyrins are a group of compounds defined by their chemical structure. These compounds are by-products of heme synthesis and are normally present at low levels in blood and other body fluids. Porphyrin tests measure porphyrins and their precursors in urine, blood, and/or stool.
Heme is an iron-containing pigment that is a component of hemoglobin and a number of other proteins. It consists of an organic portion (protoporphyrin) bound to an iron atom. The synthesis of heme is a step-by-step process that requires the sequential action of eight different enzymes. If there is a deficiency in one of these enzymes, the process is impeded and intermediate porphyrins such as uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin build up in the body's fluids and tissues. The precursors that accumulate depend on which enzyme is deficient, and they can exert toxic effects.
Porphyrin tests are used to help diagnose and monitor a group of disorders called porphyrias. There are seven types of porphyria, and each one is associated with a different enzyme deficiency. Most porphyrias are inherited, the result of a gene change (variant). Porphyrias may be classified according to the signs and symptoms of the disease as neurological, cutaneous, or both.
The porphyrias that cause neurological symptoms present with acute attacks lasting days or weeks. Signs and symptoms during the attack include abdominal pain, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, and/or seizures. There are four neurologic porphyrias: acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and the very rare ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP). Some cases of VP and HCP may also have skin-related symptoms.
The cutaneous porphyrias are associated with photosensitivity that causes redness, swelling, a burning sensation, blistering, skin thickening, hyperpigmentation, and/or scarring. There are three cutaneous porphyrias: porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). For more information about each disease, see the article on Porphyria.
Experts have not yet reached agreement on whether all porphyrias are inherited. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) may result from genetic or environmental factors such as exposure to certain chemicals or significant liver damage. This type of PCT is termed ""acquired"" or ""sporadic."" In patients with acquired PCT, the disorder usually develops after age 30 and onset in childhood is rare.
To diagnose porphyrias, laboratories measure porphyrins and their precursors in urine, blood, and/or stool. Testing may include measurement of one or more of the following:

Porphobilinogen (PBG), a porphyrin precursor, in urine
Delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), another porphyrin precursor, in urine
Porphyrins (uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and protoporphyrin) in urine, blood, or stool

Specialized laboratories may offer testing for one or more of the affected enzymes. The most commonly measured enzyme is porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG-D) in red blood cells, which tests for acute intermittent porphyria. A few laboratories offer genetic testing for specific gene variants that cause one of the porphyrias, but this type of testing is not widely available. If your healthcare practitioner strongly suspects a specific type of porphyria, a sample for genetic testing may be sent to a reference laboratory that performs that type of testing routinely.

","



Porphyrin tests are ordered when you have signs and symptoms that your healthcare practitioner suspects are due to a porphyria. Typically, you will have either neurologic symptoms or skin-related symptoms, but those with VP or HCP may have both.
Acute neurologic porphyrias—tests may be ordered when you have acute attacks lasting for days to weeks. The attacks may be triggered by a variety of drugs or environmental factors such as dietary changes, stress, and exposure to toxic substances. The attacks may include signs and symptoms, such as:

Abdominal pain, nausea
Constipation
Peripheral neuropathy—tingling, numbness, or pain in the hands and feet
Muscle weakness
Urinary retention
Confusion, hallucinations
Red or brown-colored urine

Cutaneous porphyrias—tests may be ordered when you have one or more signs and symptoms affecting sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as:

Blisters
Scarring
Hyperpigmentation
Redness
Itching
Burning
Swelling

When you have been diagnosed with a porphyria, testing may be performed on a regular basis to monitor the condition.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting porphyrin test results. Results are typically reported as below an established threshold (normal) or, if increased, reported as a specific level.
One or more of the porphyrins and their precursors are usually elevated in each of the porphyrias, and the pattern of elevation (which porphyrin is elevated in which sample) helps determine the diagnosis. For example, urine PBG is significantly increased in people with a neurologic porphyria. However, porphyrins may be increased up to several-fold in a variety of other conditions. In addition, levels may fall to near normal levels between acute attacks of a neurologic porphyria. Interpretation of the patterns can be difficult and should be done by a physician or laboratory scientist with expertise in porphyrias.
If the initial test results are negative, it means that it is unlikely that your symptoms are caused by a porphyria. Initial tests that are positive should be confirmed with follow-up testing.
People usually do not need to have all of these tests performed. The following table summarizes the patterns of results that are typical for each type of porphyria:

If enzyme testing is performed, a low level of the enzyme can help confirm a diagnosis. For example, a decreased level of porphobilinogen deaminase confirms the diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria.
The detection of a gene variant indicates that a family member has inherited a porphyria. However, gene tests cannot determine whether that individual will develop signs and symptoms of the porphyria or, if the person does, how severe they are likely to be. Fortunately, the majority of gene carriers never have an attack.



","



The diagnosis of a porphyria can be difficult. As a group, these diseases are uncommon or rare, and the signs and symptoms can be seen mimic other, more common diseases.
A variety of drugs, alcohol, and other environmental factors such as diets, stress, and illness, can trigger acute attacks of a neurologic porphyria in those with latent or inactive disease. Similarly, sun exposure can induce skin lesions in people with a cutaneous porphyria. Lifestyle modifications to avoid aggravating factors are the most effective way to minimize the impact of a porphyria.
Some reference laboratories can measure porphyrins in plasma, bile or other fluids, but this is not usually necessary to make a diagnosis.



","



Porphyrin testing is used to help diagnose and sometimes to monitor porphyrias. These disorders can be classified into two groups based on signs and symptoms: neurologic porphyrias and cutaneous porphyrias. As some porphyrias can have similar symptoms, testing is also used to help determine which type is present. A healthcare practitioner will choose individual tests based on your signs and symptoms as well as your medical and family history.
Neurologic porphyrias are associated with acute attacks involving the nervous system and/or gastrointestinal tract. They include acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria (ADP).
Tests for neurologic porphyrias are given below:

A urine test for porphobilinogen (PBG), a porphyrin precursor, is the primary test.
If the result of the PBG test is abnormal, urine porphyrin testing, which measures uroporphyrin, coproporphyrin, and other intermediate porphyrins may be ordered to provide additional information on the type of neurologic porphyria that is present.
A test to detect porphyrins in stool may be used to help distinguish between VP and HCP.
Aminolevulinic acid (ALA), another porphyrin precursor, is used to diagnose the rare ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria. ALA may be ordered along with PBG as part of the diagnostic workup, as it is usually elevated in all four of the neurologic porphyrias.

Cutaneous porphyrias produce skin-related symptoms. This type includes porphyria cutanea tarda, (PCT), erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP).
Tests for cutaneous porphyrias are given below:

Urine porphyrin testing is ordered to evaluate adults with blisters, scarring and hyperpigmentation in sun-exposed areas of the skin (suspected PCT).
A blood test for porphyrins is the best test to diagnose patients with EPP, who present with redness, itching and swelling that begins soon after sun exposure.
Both blood and urine tests for porphyrins are abnormal in CEP, a rare disorder that produces extreme sensitivity to light in children.

These tests may sometimes be used to monitor the disease.
Enzyme testing may be used to confirm a diagnosis of a specific type of porphyria by measuring the activity of the enzymes involved in the heme synthesis pathway. There are eight enzymes in the pathway and each one is related to a specific porphyria type.
Genetic testing for porphyria is not widely available, but it is another way to establish the diagnosis. Both types of tests may be used to identify family members who have inherited a porphyria, even if they do not have signs and symptoms of the disease.

To determine whether your potassium level is within normal limits; as part of an electrolyte panel or metabolic panel to help diagnose and determine the cause of an electrolyte imbalance; to monitor treatment for illnesses that can cause abnormal potassium levels in the body


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; sometimes a random or 24-hour urine sample is collected.

Potassium is an electrolyte that is vital to cell metabolism. It helps transport nutrients into cells and removes waste products out of cells. It is also important in muscle function, helping to transmit messages between nerves and muscles. This test measures the amount of potassium in the blood and/or urine.
Electrolytes are minerals that carry a charge and exist in your body fluids. Potassium and other electrolytes such as sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate (total CO2) help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintains a stable acid-base balance. Potassium is present in all body fluids, but most potassium is found within the cells. Only a small amount is present in fluids outside the cells and in the liquid part of the blood (called serum or plasma).
We get most of the potassium we need from the foods that we eat. Most people will have an adequate intake of potassium. The body uses what potassium it requires, then the kidneys eliminate the rest in the urine. The body tries to keep the blood potassium level within a very narrow range. Levels are mainly controlled by aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands above the kidneys.
Because the blood concentration of potassium is so small, minor changes can have significant health effects. Potassium levels that are too low or too high can alter the function of the nerves and muscles and there can be serious health complications, such as shock, breathing problems (respiratory failure), irregular heart beat, or the heart muscle may even lose its ability to contract.
Measuring potassium as part of an electrolyte or metabolic panel may help diagnose an electrolyte imbalance or acidosis or alkalosis. Acidosis and alkalosis describe the abnormal conditions that result from an imbalance in the pH of the blood caused by an excess of acid or alkali (base). This imbalance is typically caused by some underlying condition or disease.

","



A potassium level is a basic test and may be ordered when you have a routine medical exam or when you are being evaluated for a serious illness.
Testing may be done when you have:

Kidney disease 
Symptoms such as muscle weakness or irregular heart beat (cardiac arrhythmia)
A condition treated with diuretics or heart medications
Has high blood pressure (hypertension) or are being treated for high blood pressure

Electrolyte panels and basic metabolic panels are commonly ordered at regular intervals when a healthcare practitioner is diagnosing diabetic ketoacidosis and kidney disease or when monitoring a patient receiving dialysis, diuretic therapy, or intravenous fluids.
Urine potassium testing may be done when blood potassium levels are abnormal.



","



Potassium levels are typically interpreted along with results from other tests done at the same time, such as the results of other electrolyte tests. Low and high potassium levels can be caused by various conditions and diseases.
Examples of conditions that can cause high potassium levels (hyperkalemia) include:

Kidney disease
Addison disease
Injury to tissue
Infection
Diabetes
Dehydration
Consuming too much potassium (e.g., diets high in potassium, potassium supplements)
Treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids, excessive IV potassium
Using certain drugs that cause high potassium in a small percent of people, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ACE inhibitors, beta blockers (such as propranolol and atenolol), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (such as captopril, enalapril, and lisinopril), and potassium-sparing diuretics (such as triamterene, amiloride, and spironolactone)

Examples of conditions that can cause low potassium levels (hypokalemia) include:

Diarrhea and vomiting
Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn syndrome)
A complication of acetaminophen overdose
Diabetes - the potassium level may fall after you take insulin, particularly if you have not managed your diabetes well.
As a side-effect of ""water pills"" (potassium-wasting diuretics); if you take these, your healthcare provider may check your potassium level regularly.
Use of certain drugs such as corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol, alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as clonidine, antibiotics such as gentamicin and carbenicillin, and the antifungal agent amphotericin B

Potassium urine levels are usually compared with blood levels. The body normally eliminates excess potassium, so the urine level may be elevated because it is elevated in the blood. Urine potassium may also be elevated when the body is losing too much potassium. In this case, the blood level would be normal to low. If blood potassium levels are low due to not consuming enough, then urine concentrations will also be low.

Decreased urine potassium levels may be due to certain drugs such as NSAIDs, beta blockers, and lithium or due to the adrenal glands producing too little of the hormone aldosterone.
Increased urine potassium levels may be due to kidney disease, eating disorders such as anorexia, or muscle damage.




","



Potassium levels can be falsely elevated by a variety of circumstances surrounding specimen collection and specimen processing. For example, if you clench and relax your fist repeatedly while your blood sample is drawn, the potassium level in the blood may increase. If blood samples are delayed in getting to the lab or if the blood tubes are subjected to rough handling in transit, potassium may leak from red blood cells and falsely elevate the potassium in the serum. A healthcare practitioner may question elevated potassium results when the numbers do not fit the clinical condition. If there are any questions as to how the blood was collected, the healthcare practitioner may request that the test be repeated to verify results.



","



A potassium blood test is used to detect abnormal potassium levels, including high potassium (hyperkalemia) and low potassium (hypokalemia). It is often used as part of an electrolyte panel or basic metabolic panel for a routine health exam.
The potassium test may also be used:

To help detect, evaluate, and monitor electrolyte imbalances and/or acid-base (pH) imbalances (acidosis or alkalosis)
To help evaluate and monitor a variety of chronic or acute illnesses, such as high blood pressure or kidney disease, the most common cause of high blood potassium 
To detect abnormal values when you have diarrhea and vomiting or excessive sweating
To help determine the cause of symptoms involving the heart (e.g., irregular heart beat)
To monitor effects of drugs that can cause the kidneys to lose potassium, particularly diuretics, or drugs that decrease potassium elimination from the body, which may result in a high potassium level

Urine potassium levels may be tested in people who have abnormal blood potassium levels to help determine the cause, such as dehydration. Urine potassium testing is also used for people with abnormal kidney tests to help the healthcare practitioner determine the cause of kidney disease and to help guide treatment.

prealbumin,['Thyroxine-binding Prealbumin'],"

None


","

Reasons for ordering the prealbumin test are undergoing reassessment as understanding of prealbumin is evolving. Historically, prealbumin has been ordered to help detect protein-calorie malnutrition and to monitor the effectiveness of parenteral (for example, intravenous) nutrition. Newer evidence suggests that the reasons for changes in prealbumin levels may be more complex and the test should not be interpreted as a simple indicator of nutritional status.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Prealbumin, also called transthyretin, is one of the major proteins in the blood and is produced primarily by the liver. Its functions are to carry thyroxine (the main thyroid hormone) and vitamin A throughout the body. This test measures the level of prealbumin in the blood.
Although commonly used as a marker of malnutrition, research is continuing in order to better understand the role(s) of prealbumin in the body, especially the reasons for changes observed during illness, and the clinical utility of prealbumin testing.

","

No current consensus exists on when to get tested, although prealbumin may be ordered, along with assessments of nutritional intake, when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone is malnourished or is at risk of malnutrition.


","



With the caveats stated above, a prealbumin test may be ordered by some healthcare practitioners when signs and symptoms of malnutrition are present or when a person is felt to be at risk for malnutrition, such as during a critical or chronic illness, hospitalization, or when receiving parenteral nutrition or undergoing hemodialysis. It may also be ordered to aid in the determination of the severity of a patient's illness.



","



Normal prealbumin levels vary according to age and sex.
A low level of prealbumin may be seen with:

Malnutrition
Severe or chronic illness
Inflammation
Trauma, such as burns
Hyperthyroidism
Liver disease
Serious infections
Certain digestive disorders

Given the ongoing discussion of the appropriate use of this test as researchers continue to explore the role of prealbumin in the body and what changes in its level in the body reflect, interpretation of prealbumin results is challenging. Some suggest that a single prealbumin result is less meaningful that a series of measurements taken several days apart, along with other clinical assessments and laboratory tests. For example, measures of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may be ordered to aid in interpretation of the prealbumin results.
A high level of prealbumin may be seen in certain conditions, but the test is not used for diagnosis or monitoring in these situations.



","



Drugs such as amiodarone, estrogens, and oral contraceptives (birth control pills) can decrease prealbumin levels. Anabolic steroids, androgens, prednisolone, and high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can increase prealbumin concentrations.
Prealbumin levels can also be high in Hodgkin disease, kidney failure, iron deficiency, pregnancy, and with hyperactive adrenal glands.



",,"



Until recently, the prealbumin test was believed to be a useful marker of nutritional status and was used to help detect and diagnose protein-calorie malnutrition as well as to monitor people receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN, getting nutrition via a solution injected into a vein). It was also used to monitor changes in nutritional status in someone undergoing hemodialysis as part of treatment for kidney disease.
Some healthcare practitioners continue to use the test in this manner; however, there is controversy because changes in prealbumin may actually reflect other conditions such as inflammation, infection, or trauma. As such, it has been suggested by some health professionals that the prealbumin test should no longer be used to assess nutritional status or diagnose malnutrition. However, others believe that the test can be useful in determining prognosis for people who are critically ill, hospitalized, and/or at risk of poor outcomes and can prompt nutritional and other support that may improve patient outcomes.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta of a pregnant woman. Early in pregnancy, the level of hCG increases in the blood and is eliminated in the urine. A pregnancy test detects hCG in the blood or urine and confirms or rules out pregnancy.
During the early weeks of pregnancy, hCG is important in maintaining function of the corpus luteum. Production of hCG increases steadily during the first trimester (8-10 weeks) of a normal pregnancy, peaking around the 10th week after the last menstrual cycle. Levels then fall slowly during the remainder of the pregnancy. hCG is no longer detectable within a few weeks after delivery.
When a pregnancy occurs outside of the uterus (ectopic), the level of hCG in the blood increases at a slower rate. When an ectopic pregnancy is suspected, measuring the level of hCG in the blood (quantitative test) over time may be useful in helping to make a diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
Similarly, the hCG blood level may be abnormal when the developing baby (fetus) has a chromosome defect such as Down syndrome. An hCG test is used routinely in conjunction with a few other tests as part of screening for fetal abnormalities between 11 and 20 weeks of pregnancy. (See First Trimester Down Syndrome Screen or Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screening for more on this.)

When you suspect that you are pregnant (testing can be done reliably by 10 days after you miss your menstrual period and some methods can detect hCG even earlier); when you have signs and symptoms that suggest you may have an ectopic pregnancy or a pregnancy that is failing; prior to some medical treatments


","



For confirming pregnancy, the timing of testing depends on how accurate a woman is about the day she expects her menstrual period as well as the method used for testing. In general, blood tests are more sensitive than urine tests and can be done two days before a woman would expect her period to start. A urine or blood hCG test can be done reliably by 10 days after a missed menstrual period. Even using a urine test, a woman may be able to determine whether she is pregnant the day she misses her period, but the result could be falsely negative. Testing may be repeated at a later date if the first test is negative but pregnancy is still suspected.
Quantitative blood hCG tests may be ordered repeatedly over several days when a healthcare practitioner wants to identify or rule out an ectopic pregnancy or to monitor a woman after a miscarriage. In these cases, a woman may experience the normal signs and symptoms of pregnancy at first but then may develop others that indicate that the pregnancy is not progressing as expected.
Some signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy include:

Abnormal vaginal bleeding—because a woman is pregnant, she may not have a regular period but then may have light bleeding or spotting with an ectopic pregnancy
Low back pain
Pain or cramping in the lower abdomen or on one side of the pelvis

If untreated, signs and symptoms may get worse and may include:

Dizziness, weakness
Feeling faint or fainting
Low blood pressure
Pain in the shoulder area
Sudden, sharp pain in the pelvic area
Fever, flu-like symptoms
Vomiting

The area around an ectopic pregnancy may rupture and start to bleed, and, if undiagnosed, can lead to cardiac arrest and death.
An hCG test may be ordered prior to a medical procedure or treatment that might be harmful during pregnancy.



","



A negative hCG result means that it is unlikely that a woman is pregnant. However, tests performed too early in a pregnancy, before there is a significant hCG level, may give false-negative results. The test may be repeated in one week if there is a strong possibility of pregnancy.
A positive hCG means that a woman is likely pregnant. However, false-positive tests can occur if a woman is post-menopausal or taking hormone supplements.
The blood level of hcG in a woman with an ectopic pregnancy usually rises at a slower rate than normal. Typically, hCG levels double every 48 to 72 hours for the first four weeks of a normal pregnancy, then slow to every 96 hours by six weeks. Those with failing pregnancies will also frequently have a longer doubling time early on or may even show falling hCG concentrations during the doubling period. hCG concentrations will drop rapidly following a miscarriage. If hCG does not fall to undetectable levels, it may indicate remaining hCG-producing tissue that will need to be removed (dilation and curettage – D&C).
A high hCG level may indicate that the pregnancy dating has been miscalculated, that there is a molar pregnancy, or that it is a multiple pregnancy.



",,"



Pregnancy hCG tests that give a positive or negative result (qualitative) detect the presence of hCG. These tests may be performed by a laboratory, at a healthcare practitioner's office, or at home using a home pregnancy test kit. Methods will vary slightly but for most, a test strip is dipped into a collected cup of urine or exposed to a woman's urine stream. A colored line (or other color change) appears within the time allotted per instructions, usually about 5 minutes. For accurate test results, it is important to carefully follow the test directions. (See the article on Home Testing for more on this.) If the test is negative, it is often repeated several days later. Since hCG rises rapidly, an initial negative test can turn positive within this time period.
Quantitative hCG testing, often called beta hCG (β-hCG), measures the amount of hCG present in the blood. It may be used to:

Confirm a pregnancy
Help diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, along with a progesterone test
Help diagnose and monitor a pregnancy that may be failing 
Monitor a woman after a miscarriage

hCG blood measurements may also be used, along with a few other tests, as part of screening for fetal abnormalities. For more information on this use, see First Trimester Down Syndrome Screen or Second Trimester Maternal Serum Screening.
A quantitative hCG blood test may also be used as a tumor marker in some cancers. For more on this, see the article hCG Tumor Marker.
Occasionally, an hCG test is used to screen for pregnancy if a woman is to undergo a medical treatment, be placed on certain drugs, or have other testing, such as x-rays, that might harm the developing baby. This is usually done to help confirm that the woman is not pregnant. It has become standard practice at most institutions to screen all female patients for pregnancy using a urine or blood hCG test before a medical intervention, such as an operation, that could potentially harm a fetus.

pregnenolone,,"

The healthcare practitioner may or may not request a morning sample and may or may not give an injection such as ACTH to stimulate steroid hormone release.


","

To help detect and monitor treatment for rare types of genetic conditions that affect production of steroid hormones; some of these are called congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In addition, pregnenolone tests may be ordered by healthcare practitioners to help rule out other conditions.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Pregnenolone is a chemical substance that is a precursor to all steroid hormones. This test measures the amount of pregnenolone in the blood in order to help detect rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH).
CAH is a group of inherited disorders associated with deficiencies in the enzymes required for the production of the steroid hormones. CAH may be due to:

21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most common cause of CAH (about 90% of cases)
11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (about 5-8% of cases)
3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiencies, two rare forms of the disease
Lipoid CAH, also very rare, is most often due to a defect in the StAR gene, which codes for the Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, which, in turn, regulates the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone.

For normal steroid hormone production, cholesterol is converted into pregnenolone in the adrenal glands and then several enzymes complete the production of multiple hormones, including:

Cortisol, which helps metabolize proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, maintain blood pressure, and regulate the immune system
Aldosterone, which maintains normal sodium and potassium levels in the blood and helps control blood volume and pressure
Sex steroid hormones – including androgens, the ""male hormones"" such as testosterone, and ""female"" hormones including estrogen and progesterone, which are responsible for the development and maintenance of male and female secondary sexual characteristics

Because a low level of cortisol causes the level of a pituitary hormone that stimulates adrenal growth and hormone production (adrenocorticotropic hormone, or ACTH) to become elevated, the adrenal gland increases in size. However, the increased size and activity cannot overcome the block in cortisol production. Other substances (such as pregnenolone) that do not need the defective enzyme will be produced in excess.
With CAH, the enzyme deficiency can cause a decrease in cortisol and/or aldosterone and, in some cases, an increase or decrease in androgens. Deficient androgens can cause male newborns to be born with external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) and can affect the development of secondary sexual characteristics of both males and females at puberty.
Pregnenolone, several of the intermediate precursors, and one or more of the steroid hormones can be measured by laboratory tests to determine which step is deficient or defective, based upon which products have been produced and how much and which precursors are in excess.
If both 21- and 11-hydroxylase deficiencies have been ruled out (the most common forms of CAH), then analysis of pregnenolone, along with tests for other precursors, may be used to help establish a diagnosis of 3-beta-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase or 17-alpha-hydroxylase or StAR deficiency.

When an infant has external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) and/or has low or high blood pressure, low blood potassium (hypokalemia), or signs of excess loss of salt (salt wasting); when the most common cause for CAH, a 21-hydroxylase deficiency, has been ruled out; when a teen fails to develop secondary sexual characteristics and/or has delayed puberty


","



Pregnenolone is ordered when an infant has external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) and/or has signs of adrenal insufficiency, excess loss of sodium and fluids (""salt wasting""), or low or high blood pressure. It is usually ordered following testing for 17-OHP.
This test is primarily ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that symptoms may be due to a CAH other than 21-hydroxylase deficiency or 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency and/or wants to rule it out. An affected person may have signs and symptoms that include:
With 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency
Both males and females may have signs of adrenal insufficiency and ""salt wasting.""
Males

Male infants may have sex organs that are not clearly male or female and/or may have an opening of the urethra on the underside of the penis instead of the tip (hypospadias).
Teen boys may have poor and/or delayed development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as facial hair or deep voice.
	 

Females

Female infants usually appear normal but may have some degree of abnormal enlargement of the clitoris.
Girls may have acne and accelerated growth.
Teen girls may have excess hair on their body and face (hirsutism) and may have ovaries with numerous fluid-filled cysts (polycystic ovaries).
	 

With 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency
Both males and females may have high blood pressure (hypertension).
Males

Male infants may have entirely female external sex organs and be mistaken for a female, or they may have sex organs that are not clearly male or female
Teen boys will have symptoms of delayed puberty, with a lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics.
	 

Females

Female infants will appear normal.
Teen girls will have symptoms of delayed puberty, with a lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics and no menstrual periods (amenorrhea).
	 

In a person who has been diagnosed with one of these types of CAH, pregnenolone may be ordered periodically to monitor the condition and treatment.



","



In general, if there is an enzyme deficiency somewhere in the steroid hormone production process, then there is likely to be a mild to significant increase or decrease in pregnenolone levels. The degree of increase or decrease depends upon the enzyme that is deficient and the severity of the deficiency. Results of pregnenolone need to be interpreted along with other precursor and hormone results.
With 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency, pregnenolone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, and DHEA are typically elevated, and 17-OHP may be elevated. If they are measured, cortisol and aldosterone levels are likely to be low.
With 17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency, pregnenolone and progesterone may be elevated, along with 11-deoxycorticosterone. Other precursors and steroid hormones, if measured, may be low, including:

17-OHP
17-hydroxypregnenolone
11-deoxycortisol
DHEA
Androstenedione
Cortisol
Testosterone
Estrogens
Aldosterone
	 

With Lipoid CAH, all the steroids tested would be low, but ACTH is expected to be elevated.



","



Since deficiencies in 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 17-hydroxylase are rare causes of CAH, pregnenolone is much less commonly ordered than 17-OHP, the primary test for 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH.
Excess facial and body hair in females and the delayed development of sexual characteristics in males and/or females may be due to a number of causes other than CAH. People should consult with their healthcare provider if they have concerns about their child's, or their own, symptoms or development.



","



Pregnenolone is typically ordered as part of a panel of tests that are used to help diagnose, monitor and/or rule out two of the more rare forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The test is typically used after the more common causes of CAH have been ruled out.
All newborns are screened for the most common cause of CAH using a test that measures 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP). If this testing is abnormal, it may be followed by ACTH testing and then by groups or panels of precursors and hormones to determine which enzyme deficiencies are present. This includes 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol testing to help detect 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency.
If the two common forms of CAH are ruled out, especially if a baby has external sex organs that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia), then pregnenolone tests may be ordered among others to detect the rare forms as the cause of a person's symptoms.

To screen a pregnant woman for the presence of group B streptococcus (GBS) in her vagina or rectum to determine the risk that she will pass the bacteria on to her newborn during labor and delivery, possibly resulting in a serious infection in her newborn called early-onset GBS


","

A swab obtained from the vagina and rectum of a pregnant woman; a urine sample collected anytime during pregnancy may be used to detect significant numbers of GBS.


","



Group B strep (GBS) is the common name for the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae that can be present (colonizing) in the digestive tract and genital tract. It rarely causes symptoms or problems in healthy adults but can cause infections and serious illness in newborns who become infected before or during labor and delivery. GBS screening identifies the presence of the bacteria in the vaginal/rectal area of a pregnant woman.
GBS can cause early-onset GBS disease that occurs within the first week after birth. Signs and symptoms in newborns include fever, difficulty with feeding and breathing, irritability or lethargy, and a blue tint to the skin. GBS can cause serious infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is the most common cause of life-threatening infections in newborns.
Approximately 25% of pregnant women carry group B strep in their rectum or vagina. However, the number of infants with GBS disease has decreased significantly in recent years because of a concerted effort by healthcare practitioners to screen pregnant women for GBS late in their pregnancy and, when they are positive for GBS, to treat them with intravenous antibiotics (usually penicillin or ampicillin) during labor. This prevents or greatly decreases the risk of passing the bacteria to the newborn. Nevertheless, GBS disease remains the primary cause of early-onset sepsis, a serious and life-threatening infection in newborns.
Currently there is no vaccine available to prevent GBS, and treating all pregnant women with antibiotics is not practical. Screening for GBS and appropriate treatment continues to be the best means for preventing GBS disease in newborns.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For screening pregnant women, a swab is typically obtained from the vagina and rectum. Urine collected during pregnancy may be cultured for significant numbers of GBS.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a woman is between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy or has preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes


","



Group B strep screening is usually ordered when a woman is 35 to 37 weeks pregnant. A woman can be positive for GBS at one time during her pregnancy and negative at another. That is why it is important to screen a woman late in her pregnancy, closer to the time when she will deliver and could potentially pass the bacteria to her newborn.
Testing should also be performed when a woman goes into labor prior to 35 weeks of pregnancy to determine her GBS status.



","



A positive test for GBS in a healthy pregnant woman means that the bacteria are currently present in her vagina and/or rectum and she is at risk of passing the bacteria to her infant. She should be given antibiotics intravenously during labor to prevent spreading the bacteria to her baby. This treatment is known as intrapartum prophylaxis.
Pregnant women who have a urine culture positive for significant numbers of GBS any time during their pregnancy should receive appropriate intrapartum prophylaxis to prevent disease in their infants.
A negative result means that the woman is not likely to have GBS in the areas tested. No intrapartum prophylaxis is recommended unless she has other risk factors.



","



Every pregnant woman should know her GBS status before she delivers and discuss with her healthcare practitioner what antibiotic treatment will be given during her labor if she is positive for GBS.
CDC recommendations represent contributions from and a consensus amongst a large number of national health organizations, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Society for Microbiology.

A prenatal screening test for group B strep (GBS) is used to detect the presence of this bacteria in the vagina or rectum of pregnant women. About 25% of pregnant women are colonized by GBS. Screening is used to determine the risk that they will pass the bacteria to their newborns during birth, possibly causing a serious infection called early-onset GBS.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend:

Screening all pregnant women for the presence of GBS in the vagina and rectum between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy unless GBS has already been detected in a urine sample during the pregnancy or the woman has had a previous infant with invasive GBS disease. When GBS is detected during screening, the woman should be treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor and delivery.
If a woman has already had GBS detected in a urine sample earlier in her pregnancy or had a previous newborn with GBS, she should automatically receive IV antibiotics during delivery.
Pregnant women who have not yet been tested for GBS and have preterm labor or whose membranes have ruptured more than 18 hours previously or who have a fever during labor should receive IV antibiotics.

Healthcare practitioners check newborns soon after birth for signs and symptoms of GBS and sepsis, and if present, perform additional testing (e.g., culture of the infant's blood or spinal fluid) and treating newborns promptly if necessary.
GBS testing may include the following:

The recommended test for prenatal GBS screening is a culture of the vagina and rectum. For this test, a swab of both sites is placed into a selective enrichment broth, which encourages the growth of any GBS present. If bacteria grow in the broth, additional tests are done to confirm the presence of GBS.
In certain instances, molecular tests that detect and identify the genetic material of the bacteria directly in vaginal and rectal swabs may be used. Direct testing without broth enrichment is not as sensitive as culture, so these tests are not recommended for routine screening of women in their 35th to 37th week of pregnancy and who are not yet in labor. They may be used to screen women who are in labor and have no record of prior testing for GBS and who have no obvious risk factors for the disease. Some factors that can increase risk include premature labor, fever, or prolonged rupture of membranes.
Urine cultures may be used for screening for significant numbers of GBS.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not routinely done since GBS is routinely susceptible to ampicillin. However, testing should be performed to determine effective antibiotic therapy for women who are positive for GBS and severely allergic to penicillin and related antibiotics.

To help diagnose sepsis if you are critically ill and to help determine your risk of progressing to severe sepsis and septic shock; to help identify serious bacterial infections and to distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial conditions; to help guide antibiotic treatment


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Procalcitonin is a substance produced by many types of cells in the body, often in response to bacterial infections but also in response to tissue injury. The level of procalcitonin in the blood can increase significantly in systemic bacterial infections and sepsis. This test measures the level of procalcitonin in the blood.
Sepsis is the body's serious, overwhelming and sometimes life-threatening inflammatory response to a bacterial infection. Normally, a person's immune system targets an infection, confining the bacteria and limiting its response to the infected area. However, some infections may begin in one site of the body and then spread to the blood (bacteremia) and possibly to other sites. With sepsis, the body produces a generalized inflammatory response to the infection. This can cause a significant rise or fall in body temperature, increased heart rate and breathing rate, and a decrease in blood pressure. If not treated successfully, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis.
Other conditions can also increase procalcitonin in the blood, but usually procalcitonin is only mildly to moderately elevated. Examples of these conditions include tissue damage due to events such as trauma, surgery, pancreatitis, burns, cardiogenic shock (related to a heart attack), acute organ transplant rejection, and kidney involvement in urinary tract infections in children.
The procalcitonin test is useful in helping to detect sepsis and severe bacterial infections in the early stages and to distinguish between a bacterial infection and other non-bacterial causes of signs and symptoms in a seriously ill person.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

","

When you are seriously ill and have signs and symptoms of a systemic infection or sepsis; when you have signs and symptoms that may be due to a bacterial infection and your healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether antibiotics would be effective; at intervals to monitor effectiveness of antibiotic treatment


","



The procalcitonin test may be ordered when a seriously ill person has signs and symptoms that suggest a systemic or severe bacterial infection and/or sepsis. Signs and symptoms of sepsis may include:

Chills, shivering, fever
Clammy or sweaty skin
Extreme pain or discomfort
Rapid breathing
Rapid heartbeat
Confusion or disorientation
Less frequent urination

The test may be ordered when a person has an infection, like pneumonia or meningitis, and it is not known whether the cause is bacterial or non-bacterial. Sometimes the test may be ordered when a child has signs and symptoms that suggest a urinary tract infection.
A series of procalcitonin tests may be ordered at intervals when a healthcare practitioner wants to monitor antibiotic treatment and/or decide whether treatment can be safely discontinued.
The test may occasionally be ordered when someone has tissue damage from trauma, surgery, or a burn, or a viral illness such a pneumonia and a healthcare practitioner suspects that the person may have developed a secondary bacterial infection.



","



Procalcitonin results are interpreted in conjunction with findings from clinical evaluations as well as other laboratory tests.
Low levels of procalcitonin in a seriously ill person may indicate a low risk of developing sepsis and progression to severe sepsis and/or septic shock but do not exclude it.
Low levels may indicate that the person's symptoms are due to a cause other than a bacterial infection, such as a viral infection. A low level may also indicate a localized infection that has not spread or become systemic, or a systemic infection that is less than six hours old.
High levels indicate a high probability of sepsis and also suggest a higher risk of progression to severe sepsis and septic shock. High levels may also been seen in people with serious bacterial infections, such as meningitis.
Moderate elevations may be due to a non-infectious condition or due to an early infection and, along with other findings, should be reviewed carefully. They may also be seen in children with kidney infections.
Decreasing procalcitonin levels over time in a person being treated for sepsis or a bacterial infection indicate a response to therapy. Stable or increasing procalcitonin levels may indicate the need for continued therapy.



","



Very high levels of procalcitonin can be seen with medullary thyroid cancer, but the test is not used to diagnose or monitor this condition.
The procalcitonin test is not considered a replacement for the performance of other laboratory tests. Rather, it provides additional information that may allow appropriate treatment to be initiated or discontinued sooner.
Early detection of systemic bacterial infections, including bacterial pneumonia and bacterial meningitis, is important because they can be life-threatening and can be readily treated. However, the use of antibiotics in non-bacterial conditions may cause delays in proper treatment and can lead to more antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The procalcitonin test is being studied in additional populations, expanding beyond critically ill ICU patients. As more data are gathered, its clinical usefulness will be better understood and its intended use(s) more fully defined.



",,"



The procalcitonin test may be used, along with other tests and examinations, to help detect or rule out sepsis in a seriously ill person. It has primarily been used in people who seek care at emergency departments or who are admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with signs and symptoms that may be due to sepsis.
The procalcitonin test may be used to help:

Determine the risk that a critically ill person will progress to severe sepsis and septic shock, or the risk of the person dying
Distinguish between bacterial and non-bacterial causes of infections, such as meningitis and pneumonia
Diagnose kidney infections in children with urinary tract infections
Detect the development of a secondary bacterial infection in a person who has tissue damage due to trauma or surgery, or a viral illness such as pneumonia
Guide antibiotic treatment and/or monitor effectiveness—the test may be used in helping to decide whether antibiotics should be started or stopped for patients with lower respiratory infections and whether antibiotics can be discontinued in patients with sepsis

Examples of other tests that may be used along with procalcitonin include C-reactive protein (CRP), cultures (e.g., blood culture, urine culture), lactate, blood gases, complete blood count (CBC), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Progesterone is a steroid hormone whose main role is to help prepare a woman's body for pregnancy. It works in conjunction with several other female hormones. This test measures the level of progesterone in the blood.
On a monthly basis, the hormone estrogen causes the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, to grow and replenish itself, while a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH) leads to the release of an egg from one of two ovaries (ovulation). A corpus luteum then forms in the ovary at the site where the egg was released and begins to produce progesterone. This progesterone, supplemented by small amounts produced by the adrenal glands, stops endometrial growth and readies the uterus for the possible implantation of a fertilized egg.
If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, progesterone levels drop, and menstrual bleeding begins. If a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus, the corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone, with the egg forming a trophoblast that produces human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). After several weeks, the placenta replaces the corpus luteum as the main source of progesterone, producing relatively large amounts of the hormone throughout the rest of a normal pregnancy.
Progesterone is also produced in males but at a much lower level. Its function involves the development of sperm.

At specific times during a woman's menstrual cycle to determine whether/when she is ovulating (releasing an egg from an ovary); during early pregnancy when symptoms suggest an ectopic or failing pregnancy; throughout a high-risk pregnancy to help determine placenta and fetal health; periodically when a person is receiving progesterone replacement therapy; when a woman has abnormal uterine bleeding


","



Progesterone levels may be measured:

During an infertility assessment, when a woman is having trouble getting pregnant and her healthcare practitioner wants to verify that she is ovulating normally; the test may be ordered a few times during a woman's menstrual cycle to evaluate the change in progesterone concentrations.
When it is necessary to determine when ovulation has occurred and following drug therapy to induce ovulation
When symptoms, such as abdominal pain and spotting, suggest an ectopic pregnancy or threatened miscarriage
On a regular basis when a woman requires progesterone replacement therapy to help maintain her pregnancy
Periodically throughout a high-risk pregnancy to monitor placenta and fetal health
When a non-pregnant woman is experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding




","



Interpretation of progesterone test results depends on the reason for testing and requires knowledge of the point at which a woman is in her menstrual cycle or pregnancy. Progesterone levels usually start to increase when an egg is released from the ovary, rise for several days, and then either continue to rise with early pregnancy or fall to initiate menstruation.
If progesterone levels do not rise and fall on a monthly basis, a woman may not be ovulating nor having regular menstrual periods. This may be a cause of infertility.
If levels do not rise normally during an early pregnancy, the pregnancy may be ectopic and/or may be failing. If serial measurements do not show increasing progesterone levels over time, there may be problems with the viability of the placenta and fetus.
Low levels of progesterone may be associated with:

Ectopic pregnancy
Fetal death/miscarriage
Pre-eclampsia 
Decreased function of ovaries
Lack of menstruation (amenorrhea)
	 

Increased progesterone levels are seen occasionally with:

Some ovarian cysts
Non-viable pregnancies known as molar pregnancies
A rare form of ovarian cancer
Overproduction of progesterone by the adrenal glands
Adrenal cancer
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)

Levels of progesterone will be naturally higher during pregnancies that involve multiples (twins, triplets, etc.) than those in which there is only one fetus.
Taking estrogen and progesterone supplements can affect results.

A progesterone test may be used:

To help recognize and manage some causes of infertility. Since progesterone levels vary throughout the menstrual cycle, multiple (serial) measurements can be used for this purpose.

In early pregnancy to help diagnose a failing pregnancy (miscarriage) or a pregnancy growing outside the uterus (ectopic), along with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) testing 
To monitor a high-risk pregnancy to help evaluate placenta and fetal health
If a woman is receiving progesterone injections to help support her early pregnancy, to help determine the effectiveness of the replacement treatment

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Prolactin is a hormone whose primary role is to promote breast milk production (lactation). It is normally elevated in women during pregnancy and just after childbirth. It is normally low in men and non-pregnant women. This test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.
Prolactin is produced by the front portion (anterior) of the pituitary gland, a grape-sized organ found at the base of the brain. The brain chemical dopamine and hormone estrogen control prolactin production and release from the pituitary gland. During pregnancy, the hormones prolactin, estrogen, and progesterone stimulate breast development and milk production. Following childbirth, prolactin helps initiate and maintain the breast milk supply. If a woman does not breastfeed, her prolactin level soon drops back to pre-pregnancy levels. If she does nurse, suckling by the infant plays an important role in the release of prolactin. There is a feedback mechanism between how often the baby nurses and the amount of prolactin released by the pituitary as well as the amount of milk produced.
A common cause of an abnormally elevated prolactin level is a prolactinoma, a tumor of the pituitary gland that causes excess production of prolactin. Prolactinoma is the most common type of pituitary tumor and is usually benign. They develop more frequently in women but are also found in men. Symptoms can arise both from the unintended effects of excess prolactin, such as milk production in a woman who is not pregnant or nursing and, rarely, in a man (galactorrhea), as well as from the size and location of the tumor.
If the anterior pituitary gland and/or the tumor enlarge significantly, it can put pressure on the optic nerve, causing headaches and problems with vision. It can also interfere with the other hormones that the pituitary gland produces. In women, prolactinomas can cause infertility and irregularities in menstruation, while in men these tumors can cause a gradual loss in sexual function and libido. Left untreated, prolactinomas may eventually damage the surrounding tissues.

A man has symptoms such as decreased sex drive (libido), nipple discharge, or infertility or has a low testosterone level

When a person has a prolactinoma, prolactin levels may be ordered periodically to monitor  tumor growth and its response to treatment. They may also be ordered at regular intervals to monitor for prolactinoma recurrence.
Prolactin levels may be ordered, along with other hormone levels such as growth hormone, when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a pituitary disorder such as hypopituitarism.
When a person has a condition or is taking medications that may affect dopamine production, prolactin concentrations may sometimes be monitored.



","



Men and non-pregnant women will normally have only small amounts of prolactin in their blood. Prolactin levels do, however, need to be evaluated based on the time of day that they are collected. The levels will vary over a 24-hour period, rising during sleep and peaking in the early morning. Ideally, a person's blood sample should be drawn 3 to 4 hours after waking.
A high level of prolactin is normal during pregnancy and after childbirth while the mother is nursing.
A high level may also be seen with a few other conditions, such as:

Tumors that produce and release prolactin (prolactinomas)
The eating disorder anorexia nervosa
Diseases of the hypothalamus
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Polycystic ovary syndrome

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced primarily by cells in the prostate, a small gland in males that encircles the urethra and produces a fluid that makes up part of semen. Most of the PSA that the prostate produces is released into this fluid, but small amounts of it are also released into the blood. PSA exists in two main forms in the blood: complexed (cPSA, bound to other proteins) and free (fPSA, not bound). The most frequently used PSA test is the total PSA, which measures the sum of cPSA and fPSA in the blood.
The PSA test may be used as a tumor marker to screen for and to monitor prostate cancer. The goal of screening is to detect prostate cancer while it is still confined to the prostate. However, most experts agree that screening should be done on asymptomatic men only after thorough discussions with their healthcare practitioners on the benefits and risks and after informed decisions are made to undergo screening. Elevated blood levels of PSA are associated with prostate cancer, but they may also be seen with inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). PSA levels tend to increase in all men as they age, and men of African American heritage may have levels that are higher than other men, even at earlier ages.
PSA is not diagnostic of cancer. The gold standard for identifying prostate cancer is the prostate biopsy, collecting small samples of prostate tissue and identifying abnormal cells under the microscope. An elevated PSA may be followed by a biopsy, which has risk of complications such as pain, fever, blood in the urine, or urinary tract infection. (Read the article on Anatomic Pathology for more information on biopsies.) The total PSA test and digital rectal exam (DRE) are used together to help determine the need for a prostate biopsy.
Once the presence of prostate cancer is confirmed by biopsy, another decision must be made with regard to treatment. Prostate cancer is relatively common in men as they age and many, if not most, of the tumors are very slow-growing. While prostate cancer is the number two cause of cancer death in men, the slow-growing type is an uncommon cause of death and may never cause symptoms. A pathologist may be able to help differentiate between slow-growing cases and cancers that are likely to grow aggressively and spread to other parts of the body (metastasize).
Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of prostate cancer are issues with which health practitioners are currently grappling. In some cases, the treatment can be worse than the cancer, with the potential for causing significant side effects such as incontinence and erectile dysfunction. The PSA test and DRE cannot, in general, predict the course of a person's disease. The free PSA test is sometimes used to help determine if a biopsy should be done when the total PSA is only slightly elevated.

When you have symptoms suggestive of prostate cancer such as difficult, painful, and/or frequent urination; may also be ordered during and at regular intervals after prostate cancer treatment; in asymptomatic men, after a discussion with your healthcare practitioner about the benefits and harms of screening (For specific details, see prostate cancer screening for Adults and Adults 50 and Up).


","



For men who wish to be screened for prostate cancer, the American Cancer Society recommends that healthy men of average risk and at least a 10-year expectancy consider waiting to get tested until age 50, while the American Urological Association recommends screening for men between the ages of 55 and 69 with no routine screening after age 70 or for any man with less than a 10- to 15-year life expectancy.
For those at high risk, such as African American men and men with a family history of the disease, the recommendation is to consider beginning testing at age 40 or 45. (See Screening Tests for Adults (30-49): Prostate cancer and Screening Tests for Adults (50 and Up): Prostate cancer for details on screening recommendations.)
The total PSA test and digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be ordered when you have symptoms that could be due to prostate cancer, such as difficult, painful, and/or frequent urination, back pain, and/or pelvic pain.
If a total PSA level is elevated, a healthcare practitioner may order a repeat test a few weeks later to determine whether the PSA concentrations have returned to normal.
A free PSA test is primarily ordered when you have a moderately elevated total PSA. The results give your healthcare practitioner additional information about whether you have increased risk of having prostate cancer and help with the decision of whether to biopsy the prostate.
The total PSA may be ordered at regular intervals during treatment of prostate cancer or during ""watchful waiting"" or ""active surveillance"" of prostate cancer.



","



PSA test results can be interpreted a number of different ways and there may be differences in cutoff values between different laboratories.

Many experts consider a PSA level less than 4.0 ng/ml (nanograms per milliliter of blood) to mean that it is unlikely that you have prostate cancer. However, some feel that this level should be lowered to 2.5 ng/ml in order to detect more cases of prostate cancer. Yet, others argue that this would lead to more over-diagnosing and over-treating cancers that are not clinically significant.
There is agreement that a total PSA level greater than 10.0 ng/ml indicates an increased risk for prostate cancer (more than a 50% chance, according to the American Cancer Society, (ACS)).
Total PSA levels between 4.0 ng/ml and 10.0 ng/ml may indicate prostate cancer (about a 25% chance, according to the ACS), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), or inflammation of the prostate. These conditions are more common in the elderly, as is a general increase in PSA levels. Total PSA between 4.0 ng/ml and 10.0 ng/ml is often referred to as the ""gray zone."" It is in this range that the free PSA may be useful (see next bullet).
Free PSA—prostate tumors typically produce mostly complexed PSA (cPSA), not free PSA (fPSA). Benign prostate cells tend to produce more free PSA, which will not complex with proteins. Thus, when men in the gray zone have decreased levels of free PSA, it means that they have increased cPSA and a higher probability of prostate cancer. Conversely, when they have elevated levels of free PSA and low cPSA, the risk is diminished. The ratio of free to total PSA can help the individual and his healthcare practitioner decide whether or not a prostate biopsy should be performed.

Additional evaluations of the PSA test results are sometimes used in an effort to increase the usefulness of the total PSA as a screening tool. They include:

Age-specific PSA ranges—since PSA levels naturally increase as a man ages, it has been proposed that normal ranges be tailored to a man's age.
PSA velocity—the change in PSA concentrations over time; if the PSA continues to rise significantly over time (at least 3 samples at least 18 months apart), then it is more likely that prostate cancer is present. If it climbs rapidly, then the affected person may have a more aggressive form of cancer.
PSA doubling time—another version of the PSA velocity test; it measures how rapidly the PSA concentration doubles.
PSA density—a comparison of the PSA concentration and the volume of the prostate (as measured by ultrasound); if the PSA level is greater than what one would expect given the size of the prostate, the chance that a cancer is present may be higher.

During treatment for prostate cancer, the PSA level should begin to fall. At the end of treatment, it should be at very low or undetectable levels in the blood. If concentrations do not fall to very low levels, then the treatment has not been fully effective. Following treatment, the PSA test is performed at regular intervals to monitor the person for cancer recurrence. Since even tiny increases can be significant, those affected may want to have their monitoring PSA tests done by the same laboratory each time so that testing variation is kept to a minimum.



","



In some men, PSA may rise temporarily due to other prostate conditions, especially infection. A study found that in about half of men with high levels of PSA, their PSA levels later return to normal. Some authorities recommend that a PSA test should be repeated between 6 weeks and 3 months after the first high PSA before taking any further action. Some healthcare practitioners will prescribe a course of antibiotics if there is evidence that there is infection of the prostate.



","



The PSA test and digital rectal exam (DRE) may be used to screen both asymptomatic and symptomatic men for prostate cancer. PSA exists in two forms in the blood: free (fPSA, not bound) and complexed (cPSA, bound to other proteins). Lab tests can measure fPSA or total PSA (cPSA plus fPSA).
Most organizations, including the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the American Cancer Society, and the American Urological Association, recommend that men discuss the advantages and disadvantages of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer with their healthcare practitioner before making an informed decision about whether to be screened or not.
The total PSA test can be elevated temporarily for a variety of reasons. If an initial PSA is elevated, another PSA test may be done a few weeks after the first to determine if the PSA is still elevated. If the repeat test is elevated, a healthcare practitioner may recommend that a series of PSA tests be done over time to determine whether the level goes down, stays elevated at about the same level, or continues to increase. In cases where the cancer appears to be slow-growing, the healthcare practitioner and patient may decide to monitor its progress rather than pursue immediate treatment (called ""watchful waiting"" or ""active surveillance"").
If the DRE is normal but the PSA is moderately elevated, a free PSA test may be used to look at the ratio of free to total PSA. This can help to distinguish between prostate cancer and other non-cancer causes of elevated PSA.
If prostate cancer is diagnosed, the total PSA test may be used as a monitoring tool to help determine the effectiveness of treatment. It may also be ordered at regular intervals after treatment to detect recurrence of the cancer.

You must wait until your blood clot has been treated and resolves before having this test done. You may also be instructed to discontinue anticoagulant therapy. Follow any instructions you are given by your healthcare practitioner.

To help investigate the cause of a blood clot (thromboembolism), such as a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE); to determine whether you may have a protein C or protein S deficiency


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Protein C and protein S are two proteins in the blood that help regulate blood clot formation. Two separate tests for these proteins are often performed together as part of the investigation of a possible excessive clotting disorder. The tests measure the amount of each protein (antigen tests) and evaluate whether they are performing their proper functions (activity tests).
Normally, when a body tissue or blood vessel wall is injured, a process called hemostasis begins to form a plug at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Small cell fragments called platelets adhere to and aggregate at the site and a coagulation cascade begins as proteins called coagulation factors are activated one after the other. Eventually, a stable clot forms, preventing additional blood loss and remaining in place until the injured area has healed. The clot is then broken down when it is no longer needed. There must be an adequate amount of platelets and sufficient clotting factors and each must function normally in order for a stable clot to form.
Proteins S acts as a principal cofactor to protein C. The two work together to help regulate and control blood clot formation by inactivating specific coagulation factors (factors V and VIII) that are required to generate and form blood clots. This has the net effect of slowing down clot formation, much like brakes slow a speeding car. Therefore, if there is not enough protein C or S or they are not functioning normally, clot formation can go unchecked, possibly leading to excessive clotting. These conditions can range from mild to severe.
Deficient or dysfunctional protein C or protein S may be due to an underlying condition (acquired), such as liver disease, kidney disease, severe infections or cancer, or can be inherited, passed from parent to child. Both protein C deficiency and protein S deficiency are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. About 1 out of every 200-500 people has one normal gene and one abnormal gene (heterozygous), causing protein C deficiency. About 1 in 500 people have protein S deficiency due to heterozygous gene mutation.
There are two types of inherited protein C deficiencies:

Type 1 is related to insufficient quantity.
Type 2 is related to abnormal function and is less common than Type 1.

Protein S exists in two forms in the blood: free and bound to another protein, but only the free protein S is available to be a cofactor for protein C. There are three types of inherited protein S deficiencies:

Type 1 deficiency is due to an insufficient quantity.
Type 2 is due to abnormal function.
Type 3 is due to decreased free protein S levels, though total protein S levels are normal.

When you have had an unexplained blood clot, especially when you don't have classic risk factors, have a blood clot at a young age (younger than age 50) or in an unusual location; when your newborn has a severe clotting disorder; sometimes when a close relative has an inherited protein C or protein S deficiency


","



Protein C and protein S tests may be ordered when:

You have had a blood clot, especially when you are relatively young (younger than 50 years old)
You have had a clot in an unusual location, such as the veins coming from the liver or kidney or the blood vessels of the brain
You have had multiple clotting episodes
You do not have any other obvious reasons for developing a blood clot


Protein C and protein S levels are affected by an existing blood clot and by treatment for blood clots. Therefore, in order to determine the baseline levels, testing should be performed after your blood clot has been treated and resolves and after you have discontinued anticoagulant therapy. Usually this means that your healthcare practitioner will treat your DVT or VTE to eliminate the immediate health risk from the blood clot and then order the tests several weeks or months later to help determine the cause of your blood clot.
Testing is typically repeated on another occasion when a test that shows decreased activity or quantity of protein C or protein S. If an acquired deficiency is identified, protein C or protein S levels may be re-checked occasionally as the underlying condition progresses or is resolved.
Protein C and S tests may be ordered when a newborn has a severe clotting disorder, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or purpura fulminans.
Protein C and protein S tests may sometimes be ordered when you have a close relative with an inherited protein C or protein S deficiency, especially if your relative has a severe form or had their first VTE at a young age.



","



Normal activity and level of protein C and protein S usually indicate adequate clotting regulation.
Low protein C or protein S level or activity indicates blood clotting is not sufficiently regulated and there is an increased risk of developing a clot that blocks the flow of blood in the veins.

The degree of blood clotting risk depends on the extent of the deficiency and/or dysfunction of the protein.
Low levels may result from the body not producing enough or using up too much of the proteins or producing proteins that do not function properly.
Low amounts or dysfunctional proteins may be cause by underlying acquired conditions or, less commonly, inherited (genetic) disorders.


Acquired deficiencies
Conditions causing low protein C and protein S that develop later in life (you are not born with them) may be mild and temporary or have variable severity and be acute, chronic, or progressive. The following are some examples:

Both proteins are produced in the liver and production depends on vitamin K. Therefore low levels may be due to:
	
Liver disease
Vitamin K deficiency
Warfarin (Coumadin®) anticoagulant therapy (a vitamin K antagonist)


Conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that cause clotting and bleeding simultaneously throughout the body use up clotting factors, including protein C and protein S, at an increased rate.
Severe infections
Conditions that cause inflammation
Kidney disease
Cancers and certain chemotherapy
HIV
Pregnancy


Inherited deficiencies
Inherited mutations in the genes that code for the production of protein C and protein S are relatively uncommon. They can result in:

Decreased production of protein C or protein S
Abnormal protein C or S that cannot function normally
Abnormal protein S that is cleared more rapidly by the body (Type 3 deficiency)


When these mutations occur, they are independent of each other and the mutation is in one or the other gene (protein C or protein S). Mutations in the gene may occur in one gene copy (heterozygous) or two gene copies (homozygous). A mutation in one gene copy raises the risk of developing a DVT and/or VTE a moderate amount, but a mutation in two gene copies can cause severe clotting and may cause life-threatening purpura fulminans or DIC in the newborn. This requires a lifetime of vigilance against recurrent blood clots. Homozygous mutations in protein C or protein S are rare.
Once an inherited deficiency is confirmed, your healthcare practitioner will manage accordingly when you are in situations that increase your risk of clotting, such as surgery, chemotherapy for cancer, or oral contraceptive use.
There are three types of inherited protein S deficiencies associated with being heterozygous for protein S deficiency. People who are heterozygous for protein S deficiency have a significantly increased risk for VTE. Results that may be seen with the three types of deficiency are summarized below. The most common types are 1 and 3.

If other factor deficiencies, such as decreased antithrombin, or inherited conditions such as Factor V Leiden or prothrombin 20210 mutation are concomitantly present, the risk of blood clots is increased.



",,"



Tests for protein C and protein S are two separate tests that are often performed together to help diagnose the cause of an inappropriate blood clot such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Testing may be used to help investigate a possible excessive clotting disorder and determine the risk of having another blood clot, especially if you have no obvious risk factors or a family history of blood clots.
Tests for protein C and protein S measure their function (activity) or quantity (antigen):

Protein C and protein S functional (activity) tests are usually ordered, along with other tests for excessive clotting, to measure their activity and evaluate their ability to regulate and slowdown blood clotting. Decreased activity may be due to a decreased amount of protein C or S or, more rarely, due to dysfunctional protein C or S
Depending on the functional test results, the amount of protein C antigen and free, or sometimes total, protein S antigen may be measured to determine if decrease in activity is due to decreased production or abnormal function and to help classify the type of deficiency. If the protein S or C deficiency is due to an inherited genetic change, the quantity of protein C or protein S available and the degree of activity can be used to help determine whether you have one copy (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of the mutation. A homozygous mutation in protein C or protein S is rare.

To help diagnose or monitor conditions that result in abnormal protein production or loss of protein


","

Protein electrophoresis is typically performed on serum (the fluid portion of blood), urine samples or, in certain circumstances, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Serum is obtained by collecting a blood sample by inserting a needle into a vein. Urine samples may either be collected as a random sample (not timed) or a 24-hour urine sample. CSF is collected by a spinal tap (also known as lumbar puncture, which is inserting a needle into the spinal canal to withdraw spinal fluid).

Proteins are important building blocks of all cells and tissues. They form the structural part of most organs and make up enzymes and some hormones that regulate bodily functions. Protein electrophoresis is a lab method that separates proteins based on their size and electrical charge. Knowing which proteins are present, absent, elevated, or decreased in body fluids such as blood can help diagnose and/or monitor various diseases and conditions.
Body fluids, such as blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contain many different proteins that have various roles, such as transporting nutrients, removing toxins, and controlling body functions.
The two major types of proteins are:

Albumin is produced in the liver and accounts for about 60% of the protein in the blood.
Globulins is a collective term used to refer to proteins other than albumin. With the exception of antibodies (immunoglobulins) and some complement proteins, most of the globulins are also produced in the liver.

The various proteins in body fluids are subjected to a controlled electric current, fractionating them into a typical pattern of bands or peaks that then can be measured. The proteins are divided into six groups, called prealbumin (rarely detected on serum or urine protein electrophoresis), albumin, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, and gamma. The beta fraction may be further divided into beta 1 and beta 2 subgroups.
Each of these protein groups (electrophoresis fractions) is distinct and at specific concentrations. The patterns typically seen in certain conditions and diseases can help with diagnosis. The major serum proteins and their functions are listed according to their electrophoretic region or fraction (the visible band that they are part of) in the table titled Protein Groups.
Various conditions and diseases can affect protein production and/or protein loss, thus changing the pattern of bands seen on a protein electrophoresis. The most important example is the appearance of a distinct, monoclonal band in the gamma region. For example, uncontrolled growth and division of a malignant plasma cell as seen in multiple myeloma leads to the production of large amounts of a single type of immunoglobulin (monoclonal immunoglobulin).
When an abnormal protein (band or peak) is detected, additional tests are done to identify the type of protein (immunotyping). Immunofixation electrophoresis or immunosubtraction electrophoresis can be used to identify abnormal bands seen on protein electrophoresis, typically in the gamma region, in order to determine whether a type of antibody (immunoglobulin) is abnormally produced (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM).
In most cases of multiple myeloma, a single type of intact (whole) immunoglobulin is produced in excess. In a minority of cases, only one section of an immunoglobulin called a ""free light chain"" is produced in large amounts. These excess free light chains are released into the bloodstream and since they are relatively small molecules, they are filtered by the kidneys and released into the urine. Another term for these excess free light chains in the urine is Bence Jones proteins.

Kidney disease—large amounts of protein in the urine due to some forms of multiple myeloma (i.e., Bence Jones proteins) can affect the kidneys and may permanently damage them.
In some cases, an increase in the thickness (hyperviscosity syndrome) of the blood may lead to headaches, problems with vision, seizures, or even coma.

Urine protein electrophoresis may be ordered when you have abnormally high levels of protein in your urine.
Immunofixation electrophoresis or immunosubtraction electrophoresis may be ordered when an abnormal band suggestive of a monoclonal immunoglobulin is detected on either a serum or a urine electrophoresis.
CSF protein electrophoresis may be ordered:

Urine protein electrophoresis
Usually there is very little protein in urine. Typically, if a significant amount of protein is present (proteinuria), it appears in one of three main patterns:

Glomerular proteinuria: Normally, clusters of looping blood vessels in the kidneys called glomeruli prevent protein from leaking into the urine. When the glomeruli are damaged, as in some forms of kidney disease, albumin and other large plasma proteins may leak through and be detected in the urine.
Tubular proteinuria: Normally, some very small proteins can pass through the glomeruli in the kidneys but are reabsorbed from the urine by tubules. When the tubules are damaged, these small proteins will appear in the urine (e.g., beta-2 microglobulin, marker of tubular damage), but large proteins will not.
Specific proteins: Some other small proteins are not normally present in significant amounts in blood. When they are elevated in blood, they can pass through the kidneys and appear in the urine. Some examples are:
	
Monoclonal immunoglobulins or free light chains (Bence Jones proteins)
Myoglobin—this is a small, oxygen-binding protein found in heart and skeletal muscle. Myoglobin may be detected in urine when there is heart or muscle injury. (See the Myoglobin article for more details.)
Hemoglobin— this is the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin may be detected in the urine when there is damage to red blood cells (e.g., hemolytic anemia).



CSF protein electrophoresis

The presence of multiple distinct bands in the gamma region (oligoclonal bands) that are present in CSF but not in serum suggests multiple sclerosis (MS). Most people with multiple sclerosis, as well as some other inflammatory conditions of the brain, have such oligoclonal bands. Oligoclonal bands are not a specific finding for MS because not all people whose CSF exhibits this pattern have MS. Further testing and evaluations (e.g., MRI or CT scan) are necessary to help make a diagnosis.
Presence of higher than normal amounts of polyclonal immunoglobulins (antibodies produced by many different plasma cells) suggests an infection of the central nervous system.

Immunofixation electrophoresis or immunosubtraction capillary electrophoresis identifies the type of immunoglobulin protein(s) present as monoclonal bands on a protein electrophoresis pattern. Typically, this testing determines the presence and type of monoclonal proteins (e.g., IgG kappa). For more about this, read the article on Multiple Myeloma.



","



Immunizations within the previous six months can increase antibodies (immunoglobulins), as can drugs such as phenytoin (Dilantin), procainamide, oral contraceptives, methadone, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) and anti-cancer immunotherapy.
Aspirin, bicarbonates, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), corticosteroids, and neomycin can affect protein electrophoresis results. 



","



Protein electrophoresis is used to identify and measure the presence of abnormal proteins, the absence of normal proteins, and/or to detect various protein electrophoresis patterns associated with certain conditions, as found in blood, urine or other body fluids.
The information from protein electrophoresis can provide clues that a disease or condition is affecting protein production or loss of protein, but the results usually do not provide a definitive diagnosis. Instead, additional follow-up tests are needed to investigate the cause and to try to identify the nature of the underlying disease.
Serum electrophoresis may be used to:

Help in the diagnose and monitoring of lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or monoclonal gammopathies, such as multiple myeloma
Investigate abnormal findings on other laboratory tests, such as total protein, albumin level, elevated calcium levels, or low white or red blood cell counts
Evaluate someone for an inflammatory condition, an autoimmune disease, an infection, a kidney or liver disorder

Urine protein electrophoresis may be used:

In the investigation of multiple myeloma
To investigate the cause of abnormally high amounts of proteins in urine (various forms and causes of proteinuria)

When an abnormal band on either a serum or a urine electrophoresis pattern suggests the presence of a single type of immunoglobulin (monoclonal), immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) or immunosubtraction electrophoresis can be used as follow-up tests to further identify abnormal proteins.
CSF protein electrophoresis may be used:

To look for the characteristic banding pattern that may be seen in multiple sclerosis (oligoclonal bands)

None needed, although if you are receiving anticoagulant therapy, the blood sample should be collected before taking your daily dose.


","

A prothrombin time (PT) is a test used to help detect and diagnose a bleeding disorder or excessive clotting disorder; the international normalized ratio (INR) is calculated from a PT result and is used to monitor how well the blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant) warfarin (Coumadin®) is working to prevent blood clots.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; sometimes blood from a fingerstick


","



The prothrombin time (PT) is a test that helps evaluate your ability to appropriately form blood clots. The international normalized ratio or INR is a calculation based on results of a PT that is used to monitor individuals who are being treated with the blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant) warfarin (Coumadin®).
A PT measures the number of seconds it takes for a clot to form in your sample of blood after substances (reagents) are added. The PT is often performed along with a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and together they assess the amount and function of proteins called coagulation factors that are an important part of proper blood clot formation.
In the body, when there is an injury and bleeding occurs, the clotting process called hemostasis begins. This process involves in part a series of sequential chemical reactions called the coagulation cascade, in which coagulation or ""clotting"" factors are activated one after another and result in the formation of a clot. There must be a sufficient quantity of each coagulation factor, and each must function properly, in order for normal clotting to occur. Too little can lead to excessive bleeding; too much may lead to excessive clotting.
In a test tube during a laboratory test, there are two ""pathways"" that can initiate clotting, the so-called extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Both of these then merge into a common pathway to complete the clotting process.

The PT test evaluates how well all of the coagulation factors in the extrinsic and common pathways of the coagulation cascade work together. Included are: factors I (Fibrinogen), II (Prothrombin), V, VII and X.
The PT/INR may be done at the same time as a PTT, which evaluates the clotting factors that are part of the intrinsic and common pathways: XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, II (prothrombin), and I (fibrinogen) as well as prekallikrein (PK) and high molecular weight kininogen (HK).

The PT and PTT evaluate the overall ability to produce a clot in a reasonable amount of time and, if any of these factors are deficient in quantity or not functioning properly, the test results will be prolonged.
The PT is usually measured in seconds and is compared to a normal range that reflects PT values in healthy individuals. Because the reagents used to perform the PT test vary from one laboratory to another and even within the same laboratory over time, the normal ranges also will fluctuate. To standardize results across different laboratories in the U.S. and the world, a World Health Organization (WHO) committee developed and recommended the use of the Internationalized Normalized Ratio (INR), calculated based on the PT test result, for people who are receiving the anticoagulant warfarin (Coumadin®). Warfarin is prescribed for people with a variety of conditions, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and some cardiovascular diseases (CVD) like atrial fibrillation to ""thin"" their blood and prevent inappropriate clotting.
The INR is a calculation that adjusts for changes in the PT reagents and allows for results from different laboratories to be compared. Most laboratories report both PT and INR values whenever a PT test is performed. The INR should be only applicable, however, for those taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin.

When you are taking warfarin or when you have unexplained or prolonged bleeding or inappropriate blood clotting


","



A PT and INR are ordered on a regular basis when a person is taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin to make sure that the drug is producing the desired effect.
The PT may be ordered when a person who is not taking anticoagulant drugs has signs or symptoms of excessive bleeding or clotting, such as:

Unexplained bleeding or easy bruising
Nosebleeds
Bleeding gums
A blood clot in a vein or artery
An acute condition such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) that may cause both bleeding and clotting as coagulation factors are used up at a rapid rate
A chronic condition such as severe liver disease that may affect hemostasis

PT, along with PTT, may be ordered prior to surgery when the surgery carries an increased risk of blood loss and/or when the person has a clinical history of bleeding, such as frequent or excessive nosebleeds and easy bruising, which may indicate the presence of a bleeding disorder.



","



For people taking warfarin, most laboratories report PT results that have been adjusted to the INR. These people should have an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 for basic ""blood-thinning"" needs. For some who have a high risk of a blood clot, the INR needs to be higher - about 2.5 to 3.5.
For individuals who are not taking warfarin, the reference range for a PT depends on the method used, with results measured in seconds and compared to the normal range established and maintained by the laboratory that performs the test. This normal range represents an average value of healthy people who live in that area and will vary somewhat from lab to lab. Someone who is not taking warfarin would compare their PT test result to the normal range provided with the test result by the laboratory performing the test.
A prolonged PT means that the blood is taking too long to form a clot. This may be caused by conditions such as liver disease, vitamin K deficiency, or a coagulation factor deficiency (e.g., factor VII deficiency). The PT result is often interpreted with that of the PTT in determining what condition may be present.

The international normalized ratio (INR) is a calculation based on results of a PT and is used to monitor individuals who are being treated with the blood-thinning medication (anticoagulant) warfarin (Coumadin®).
The PT and INR are used to monitor the effectiveness of the anticoagulant warfarin. Warfarin is prescribed for people with a variety of conditions to ""thin"" their blood and prevent inappropriate clotting. A healthcare practitioner will typically prescribe warfarin and measure how well that dose ""thins"" the blood using the PT/INR. The dose may be adjusted up or down depending on the result and to ensure the dose is sufficient in preventing clots without causing excessive bleeding. This balance requires careful monitoring.
Warfarin may be prescribed for conditions such as:

Irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation)
The presence of artificial heart valves
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE)
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Occasionally, in heart attacks with certain risk factors

The PT test may be used along with a PTT as the starting points for investigating excessive bleeding or clotting disorders. By evaluating the results of the PT and PTT together, a health practitioner can gain clues as to what bleeding or clotting disorder may be present. These tests are not diagnostic by themselves but usually provide information on whether or what further testing may be needed.
Examples of other testing that may be done along with a PT and PTT or in follow up to abnormal results include:

Platelet count – to determine if platelets are decreased, which can cause excessive bleeding
Fibrinogen testing – may be done to rule out a low level or dysfunction of fibrinogen as a cause of a prolonged PT
Coagulation factor tests – these measure the activity (function) of coagulation factors. They can detect reduced levels of the protein or proteins that don't work properly (have reduced function). Rarely, the antigen level (quantity) of a coagulation factor may also be measured.
von Willebrand factor – sometimes ordered to help determine if von Willebrand disease is the cause of a prolonged PTT
Lupus anticoagulant testing – may be ordered to further investigate the cause of prolongation of PTT and/or PT, particularly for patients with clotting disorders

Based on carefully obtained patient histories, the PTT and PT tests are sometimes selectively performed as pre-surgical or before other invasive procedures to screen for potential bleeding tendencies.

To detect a rare mutation in the PSEN1 gene known to be associated with early onset familial Alzheimer disease (EOFAD)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



This test looks for mutations in the PSEN1 gene sequence that have been associated with early onset familial Alzheimer disease (EOFAD).
Although most Alzheimer disease (AD) cases present after the age of 65, about 5-10% of cases present in people younger than 65 years of age. Much of this early onset AD is familial – it runs in family lines and is caused by a genetic mutation. So far, there have been three genes that have been identified as being associated with EOFAD: PSEN1, PSEN2, and amyloid precursor protein (APP).
Of these three genes, PSEN1 is the most commonly involved and is thought to cause about 20% to 70% of early onset AD. Since PSEN1-associated AD is dominantly inherited (autosomal dominant), it only takes one mutated copy, inherited from either the mother or father, to lead to the development of EOFAD.
Why PSEN1 mutations cause EOFAD is not completely understood. Scientists think that the normal role of the PSEN1 gene is to make the presenilin 1, a protein used in the development of the brain and spinal cord. Presenilin 1 also works with other enzymes to cut certain proteins into smaller pieces (amyloid beta peptides). A mutation in PSEN1 produces an abnormal presenilin 1 protein that no longer functions properly, resulting in a breakdown of this process. This can lead to increased production of a longer, stickier configuration of the amyloid beta protein, which is toxic to the nervous system and eventually forms the characteristic amyloid plaques seen in individuals with AD.
A wide variety of PSEN1 mutations have been identified in the families studied to date, and there is no common or high frequency mutation known. Some mutations may be more common in specific populations. Testing is more straightforward if a specific PSEN1 mutation has already been identified in a person's family line. The PSEN1 genetic mutation analysis is a relatively new test and is offered by a limited number of laboratories.

When you are an adult who has symptoms of dementia and a strong family history of Alzheimer disease that begins before age 60 to 65 or if you are an asymptomatic adult with a family member who has early onset Alzheimer disease and an identified PSEN1 genetic mutation


","



This test may be ordered when you develop symptoms associated with Alzheimer disease before 65 years of age. Signs and symptoms may include:

Loss of memory that affects daily life—forgetting information that was recently learned. This can occur with normal aging, but the information is usually remembered later. This includes forgetting important dates or events, having to rely on memory aids, and asking for the same information again and again.
Difficulty planning or problem solving, such as keeping track of bills and payments
Problems completing usual tasks, such as forgetting how to get to a familiar location
Confusion about place or time—losing track of time, forgetting where you are or how you got there
Increasing difficulty reading or judging distances
Problems speaking or writing—forgetting words, repeating the same thing, struggling with vocabulary
Losing things more frequently and not being able to logically retrace steps to find them
Impaired judgment, such as giving away unusually large amounts of money
Increasing withdrawal from activities, including social, work or family events
Changes in mood and personality, such as increasing anxiety, fear, suspicion and depression

PSEN1 mutation analysis may also be ordered when an asymptomatic adult has a strong family history of early onset Alzheimer disease, especially when there are multiple family members over several generations who have had or were thought to have had EOFAD.



","



If a person has a disease-causing PSEN1 mutation, it is highly likely that the person will eventually develop AD, usually at a similar age to other affected family members. The symptoms, severity, and rate of progression can vary from individual to individual. Since it is a dominant gene, each child will have a 50% chance of having the PSEN1 mutation passed on to them.
If no PSEN1 mutation is identified, it is still possible that the person has EOFAD because the specific PSEN1 mutation is not able to be identified by the existing testing method or there is a mutation in a different gene.



","



PSEN1 mutations are not associated with late onset sporadic AD. Some individuals will not have a strong family history because their family is not informative (i.e., key people passed away before they would have developed symptoms or their full medical histories are not known). Other issues that could confound family history are non-paternity and undisclosed adoption.



",,"



PSEN1 genetic mutation analysis may be performed in adults who have a strong family history of early onset Alzheimer disease (EOFAD), especially when a specific PSEN1 mutation has been identified in other family members. It may be used to aid in the differential diagnosis of EOFAD versus other forms of early onset dementia but usually only in those with a strong family history of disease.
The PSEN1 test is not useful as a screen for the general population or for those who have late onset familial AD or sporadic AD.

Red blood cells (RBCs), also called erythrocytes, are cells that circulate in the blood and carry oxygen throughout the body. The RBC count totals the number of red blood cells that are present in your sample of blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC) and is often used in the general evaluation of a person's health.
Blood is made up of a few different types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to RBCs, there are white blood cells (WBCs) and platelets. These cells are produced in the bone marrow and are released into the bloodstream as they mature. RBCs typically make up about 40% of the blood volume. RBCs contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and enables RBCs to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs of the body. RBCs also help transport a small portion of carbon dioxide, a waste product of cell metabolism, from those tissues and organs back to the lungs, where it is expelled.
The typical lifespan of an RBC is 120 days. Thus the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. A number of conditions can affect RBC production and some conditions may result in significant bleeding. Other disorders may affect the lifespan of RBCs in circulation, especially if the RBCs are deformed due to an inherited or acquired defect or abnormality. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the RBC count. Changes in the RBC count usually mirror changes in other RBC tests, including the hematocrit and hemoglobin level.

If RBCs are lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, if bone marrow production is disrupted, or if the RBCs produced do not function normally, or do not contain enough hemoglobin, then you may develop anemia, which affects the amount of oxygen reaching tissues.
If too many RBCs are produced and released, then you can develop polycythemia. This can cause thicker blood, decreased blood flow and related problems, such as headache, dizziness, problems with vision, and even excessive clotting or heart attack.

Conditions that cause red blood cells to be destroyed, such as hemolytic anemia caused by autoimmunity or defects in the red cell itself; the defects could be a hemoglobinopathy (e.g., sickle cell anemia), thalassemia, an abnormality in the RBC membrane (e.g., hereditary spherocytosis), or enzyme defect (e.g., G6PD deficiency).
Sudden (acute) or chronic bleeding from the digestive tract (e.g., ulcers, polyps, colon cancer) or other sites, such as the bladder or uterus (in women, heavy menstrual bleeding, for example)
Nutritional deficiency such as iron deficiency or vitamin B12 or folate deficiency
Bone marrow damage (e.g., toxin, radiation or chemotherapy, infection, drugs)
Bone marrow disorders such as leukemia, multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, or lymphoma or other cancers that spread to the bone marrow
Chronic inflammatory disease or condition
Kidney failure—severe and chronic kidney diseases lead to decreased production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that promotes RBC production by the bone marrow.
	 

Some causes of a high RBC count (polycythemia) include:

Dehydration—as the volume of fluid in the blood drops, the count of RBCs per volume of fluid artificially rises.
Lung (pulmonary) disease—if someone is unable to breathe in and absorb sufficient oxygen, the body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Congenital heart disease—with this condition, the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently, resulting in a decreased amount of oxygen getting to tissues. The body tries to compensate by producing more red blood cells.
Kidney tumor that produces excess erythropoietin
Smoking
Genetic causes (altered oxygen sensing, abnormality in hemoglobin oxygen release)
Polycythemia vera—a rare disease in which the body produces too many RBCs




","



A recent blood transfusion can affect results of an RBC count.
Alteration of the number of RBCs is often temporary and can be easily corrected and/or returned to normal levels by treating and resolving the underlying condition.
During pregnancy, body fluids tend to accumulate, thus decreasing the RBC count in relation to fluid volume.
Living at high altitudes causes an increase in RBC count; this is the body's response to the decreased oxygen available at these heights.
Women tend to have slightly lower RBC counts than men.



","



A red blood cell (RBC) count is typically ordered as part of a complete blood count (CBC) and may be used as part of a health checkup to screen for a variety of conditions. This test may also be used to help diagnose and/or monitor a number of diseases that affect the production or lifespan of red blood cells.

Red blood cell antibodies are proteins produced by the body's immune system directed against ""foreign"" red blood cells (RBCs). This test identifies the specific red blood cell antibodies present in the blood of an individual who has a positive screening test for RBC antibodies (an RBC antibody screen or direct antiglobulin test, DAT).
Each individual inherits a specific combination of RBC antigens, structures found on the surface of the cells, including those associated with the major blood types A, B, AB, and O. Normally, people will only produce antibodies directed against ""foreign"" antigens not found on their own cells. All individuals naturally produce antibodies against the A and/or B antigens that are not on their own RBCs. For example, a person who is blood type A will have antibodies in their blood to the B antigen.
Another important RBC antigen is an Rh antigen called the D antigen. People either have the D antigen on their RBCs (Rh-positive) or do not (Rh-negative). Antibodies to the D antigen are not naturally-occurring; a person who is Rh-negative produces antibodies only after being exposed to RBCs from another person that has the D antigen, for example, a mother exposed to her baby's RBCs during pregnancy or during a blood transfusion.
Blood that is to be transfused must be compatible with the recipient's ABO and Rh blood type because ABO and Rh antibodies present in the recipient's blood have the potential to rapidly destroy (hemolyze) the transfused RBCs and cause serious complications. Antibodies to the major blood types are routinely identified using blood typing tests, and blood for transfusion is matched with the ABO and Rh blood type of the recipient. (For more on this, see Blood Typing and Transfusion Medicine.)
In addition to these ABO and Rh blood group antigens, there are numerous other RBC blood group antigens, such as Kell, Kidd, Duffy, and other Rh antigens. Antibodies to these antigens are not made naturally and are only produced by the body when exposed to them through blood transfusion or when a mother is exposed to a baby's blood cells during pregnancy, labor and delivery. These antibodies may or may not be associated with adverse reactions, and identification of the specific type of RBC antibody present in a person's blood may be important in avoiding these reactions.
Tests that classify antibodies directed against RBC antigens other than ABO are performed when the presence of an antibody is detected through a positive antibody screen (DAT or RBC antibody screen). This screen may be done as part of a ""type and screen,"" which is ordered in situations such as:

Part of a prenatal workup
When a blood transfusion has been ordered
Following a suspected transfusion reaction
Hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN)
Suspected autoimmune hemolytic anemia (in which the body inappropriately makes antibodies against antigens on its own red blood cells)

Complications can develop when a person with an RBC antibody is again exposed to RBCs bearing the ""foreign"" antigen, whether by another transfusion or pregnancy. The RBC antibodies may attach to the specific antigens on the foreign RBCs and target them for destruction. Depending on the antigen and antibody involved and the quantity of RBCs affected, this can cause a reaction ranging from mild to severe and potentially life-threatening.
Antibody/antigen combinations capable of destroying RBCs are called clinically significant. The reaction may happen immediately, such as during a blood transfusion, or take longer, from one to several days or longer following a transfusion. RBC destruction, called hemolysis, can occur within blood vessels or in the liver or spleen. Hemolysis can cause signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, flank pain, low blood pressure, bloody urine, and jaundice.

The antibody identification test may be ordered when an RBC antibody screen or a direct antiglobulin test is positive. The test may also be performed when a person has a transfusion reaction or when a mother has a baby with hemolytic disease of the newborn.



","



Results of RBC antibody identification will name the specific antibody or antibodies present in the blood of the person tested.
If the antibody identified is considered clinically significant, then it will need to be taken into account with each transfusion and/or pregnancy.

If clinically significant RBC antibodies have been identified during pregnancy, the baby's condition will be monitored. Whether or not the antibodies will affect the baby's condition depends upon the antibody present and the RBC antigens that the fetus has inherited. Some antibodies can cross the placenta from mother to baby and cause hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN).
For blood transfusions, if one or more clinically significant RBC antibodies are identified, then donor blood that lacks the corresponding RBC antigens must be used for transfusion. When someone has a condition that requires recurrent transfusions, the person is exposed to many foreign RBC antigens and may develop multiple RBC antibodies over time, making the process of finding compatible blood increasingly challenging.

If an antibody is not considered clinically significant, then it is not likely to cause a transfusion reaction in the person or cause HDN. For blood transfusions, it is not necessary to find compatible blood if the antibody identified is not likely to cause a transfusion reaction (is not clinically significant).

Some RBC antibodies are naturally-occurring; they do not require an initial exposure to the specific targeted antigen. These include antibodies that correspond to the major A and B red blood cell antigens.
Sometimes an RBC antibody may be present in such a small quantity that it does not cause a positive RBC antibody screen during pre-transfusion blood compatibility testing. Once a person has developed an RBC antibody, the person must always be matched with antigen-negative blood, even if the antibody is no longer detectable. This is because after the blood is given to the recipient, it can trigger renewed, rapid antibody production and cause a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction several days later.
RBC antibodies are not the only things that can cause a transfusion reaction. The recipient's immune system may also react to someone else's white blood cells or platelets, or to drugs that the donor may have taken. Rarely, antibodies in the plasma of the blood donor may target the RBCs of the transfusion recipient if products with a large amount of plasma are transfused.
Some RBC antibodies may not target a specific RBC antigen but may react with a broad range of different red blood cell antigen types, including the person's own. These types of antibodies can occur in association with autoimmune disorders, lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, certain viral or mycoplasma infections, and some medications.
An RBC antibody can occasionally be missed with antibody identification testing if the antibody is low titer or formed against a rare antigen. This is why the crossmatching process is important even in patients with no demonstrated antibodies. It evaluates the compatibility of the donor's red blood cells and recipient's serum for each unit of RBCs transfused (see Transfusion Medicine).



",,"



Red blood cell (RBC) antibody identification is used as a follow-up test to a positive RBC antibody screen or a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT). It is used to identify the specific antibody detected by these screening tests to help identify the cause of a transfusion reaction, hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), or hemolytic anemia.
A DAT or RBC antibody screen is performed:

On a pregnant woman during each pregnancy to determine whether the mother has developed any red blood cell (RBC) antibodies
To confirm the presence and determine the cause of HDN
Before transfusions of red blood cells as part of a ""type and screen"" or ""type and crossmatch""
In the investigation of a suspected transfusion reaction
To help determine if hemolytic anemia may be caused by an autoantibody directed against a person's own red cells

The RBC antibody identification test is used to name the specific antibody or antibodies that are present to determine if they are likely to be clinically significant, i.e., if they are likely to cause a transfusion reaction of HDN. Some RBC antibodies are known to cause moderate to severe reactions while other less significant ones may cause a positive test but few to no symptoms or complications in the blood transfusion recipient or baby.

The RBC antibody screen looks for circulating antibodies in the blood directed against red blood cells (RBCs). The primary reason that a person may have RBC antibodies circulating in the blood is because the person has been exposed, through blood transfusion or through pregnancy, to RBCs other than his or her own (foreign RBCs). These antibodies have the potential to cause harm if a person is transfused with red blood cells that the antibodies may target or if a pregnant woman has antibodies that target the red cells of her developing baby.
RBCs normally have structures on their surface called antigens. People have their own individual set of antigens on their RBCs, determined by inheritance from their parents. The major antigens or surface identifiers on human RBCs are the O, A, and B antigens, and a person's blood is grouped into an A, B, AB, or O blood type according to the presence or absence of these antigens.
Another important surface antigen is Rh factor, also called D antigen. If it is present on a person's red blood cells, that person's blood type is Rh+ (positive); if it is absent, the blood is type Rh- (negative). (For more on these antigens, see the article on Blood Typing). In addition, there are many other types of RBC antigens that make up lesser-known blood groups, such as Kell, Lewis, and Kidd blood groups.
There are a few reasons why someone may produce antibodies against RBC antigens.

Following blood transfusions: Antibodies directed against A and B red cell antigens are naturally-occurring; we produce them without having to be exposed to the antigens. Before receiving a blood transfusion, a person's ABO group and Rh type are matched with that of donor blood to prevent a serious transfusion reaction from occurring. That is, the donor's blood must be compatible with the recipient's so that antibodies do not react with and destroy donor blood cells.

	If someone receives a blood transfusion, the person's body may also recognize other RBC antigens from other blood groups (such as Kell or Kidd) that the person does not have as foreign. The recipient may produce antibodies to attack these foreign antigens. People who have many transfusions make antibodies to RBCs because they are exposed to foreign RBC antigens with each transfusion.

During pregnancy, with blood type incompatibility between mother and baby: A baby may inherit antigens from the father that are not on the mother's RBCs. The mother may be exposed during pregnancy or at delivery to the foreign antigens on her baby's RBCs when some of the baby's cells enter the mother's circulation as the placenta separates. The mother may begin to produce antibodies against these foreign RBC antigens. This can cause hemolytic disease of the newborn, usually not affecting the first baby but affecting subsequent children when the mother's antibodies cross the placenta, attach to the baby's RBCs, and hemolyze them. An RBC antibody screen can help determine if the mother has produced RBC antibodies outside of the ABO blood group.

The first time a person is exposed to a foreign RBC antigen, by transfusion or pregnancy, the person may begin to produce antibodies but his or her cells do not usually have the time during the first exposure to make enough antibodies to actually destroy the foreign RBCs. When the next transfusion or pregnancy occurs, the immune response may be strong enough for enough antibodies to be produced, attach to, and break apart (hemolyze) the transfused RBCs or the baby's RBCs. Antibodies to the ABO antigens are naturally-occurring so do not require exposure to foreign RBCs. 
RBC antibodies that are detected with a screen can be identified with an antibody identification test.

When preparing for a blood transfusion; during pregnancy and at delivery


","




An RBC antibody screen is performed prior to any anticipated blood transfusion.
An RBC antibody screen is performed early in pregnancy as part of every woman's pregnancy workup. In Rh-negative women, it is also done at 28 weeks, prior to giving an injection of Rh immune globulin (RhIg), and after delivery if the baby is determined to be Rh-positive. In negative pregnant women with known antibodies, the RBC antibody screen is sometimes ordered as a monitoring tool to roughly track the amount of antibody present.




","



Transfusion: If an RBC antibody screen is positive, then one or more RBC antibodies are present. Some of these antibodies will be more significant than others. When an RBC antibody screen is used to screen prior to a blood transfusion, a positive test indicates the need for an antibody identification test to identify the antibodies that are present. Once the antibody has been identified, donor blood must be found that does not contain the corresponding antigen(s) so that the antibody will not react with and destroy donor RBC antigens following a blood transfusion.
Pregnancy: If an Rh-negative mother has a negative RBC antibody screen, then an Rh immune globulin injection is given within 72 hours to prevent antibody production. If she has a positive test, then the antibody or antibodies present must be identified. If an antibody to the D antigen has been actively formed by the mother, then the RhIg injection is not useful. If she has a different antibody, then the RhIg injection can still be given to prevent her from producing antibodies to the D antigen.



","



A circulating RBC antibody, once present, will never truly go away but may drop to undetectable levels. If the person is exposed to the antigen again, production will kick quickly into gear and attack the RBCs so the antibody will be honored (treated as though it is present) even when not detectable.
Each blood transfusion that a person has exposes that person to the combination of antigens on the donor's RBCs. Whenever the transfused RBCs contain antigens foreign to the recipient's RBCs, there is the potential to produce an antibody. If someone has many blood transfusions over a period of time, that person may produce antibodies against many different antigens. This can make finding compatible blood increasingly difficult.



",,"



An RBC antibody screen is used to screen an individual's blood for antibodies directed against red blood cell (RBC) antigens other than the A and B antigens. It is performed as part of a ""type and screen"" whenever a blood transfusion is anticipated or as part of prenatal testing of pregnant women.
The primary reason that a person may have RBC antibodies circulating in the blood is because the person has been exposed, through blood transfusion or through pregnancy, to RBCs other than his or her own (foreign RBCs). These antibodies have the potential to cause harm if a person is transfused with red blood cells that the antibodies may target or if a pregnant woman has antibodies that target the red cells of her developing baby.
If an antibody is detected, then an antibody identification test must be done to determine which antibodies are present. During a crossmatch, a variation of the RBC antibody screen is performed if clinically significant antibodies are present. In the case of blood transfusions, RBC antibodies must be taken into account and donor blood must be found that does not contain the antigen(s) to which the person has produced antibodies.
If someone has an immediate or delayed reaction to a blood transfusion, a health practitioner will order a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to help investigate the cause of the reaction. (The DAT detects RBC antibodies attached to red blood cells.) An RBC antibody screen will be performed to see if the affected person has developed any new antibodies if the DAT is positive.
During pregnancy, the RBC antibody screen is used to screen for antibodies in the blood of the mother that might cross the placenta and attack the baby's red cells, causing hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). The most serious cause is an antibody produced in response to the RBC antigen called the ""D antigen"" in the Rh blood group system.
A person is considered to be Rh-positive if the D antigen is present on the person's RBCs and Rh-negative if the D antigen is not present. An Rh-negative mother may develop an antibody when she is exposed to blood cells from an Rh-positive fetus. To prevent this, an Rh-negative mother should have an RBC antibody screen performed early in her pregnancy, at 28 weeks, and again at the time of delivery. If there are no Rh antibodies present at 28 weeks, then the woman is given an injection of Rh immune globulin (RhIg) to clear any Rh-positive fetal RBCs that may be present in her bloodstream to prevent the production of Rh antibodies by the mother.
At birth, the baby's Rh status is determined. If the baby is Rh-negative, then the mother does not require another RhIg injection; if the baby is Rh-positive and the mother's antibody status is negative for anti-D, the mother is given additional RhIG.
This test also may be used to help diagnose autoimmune-related hemolytic anemia in conjunction with a DAT. This condition may be caused when a person produces antibodies against his or her own RBC antigens. This can happen with some autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, with diseases such as lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and with infections such as mycoplasma pneumonia and mononucleosis. It can also occur in some people with the use of certain medications, such as penicillin.

A renal panel is a group of tests that may be performed together to evaluate kidney (renal) function. The tests measure levels of various substances, including several minerals, electrolytes, proteins, and glucose (sugar), in the blood to determine the current health of your kidneys.
The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs located at the bottom of the ribcage to the right and left of the spine. They are part of the urinary tract and perform a few essential roles and functions within the body.

Within the kidneys are about a million tiny blood filtering units called nephrons. In each nephron, blood is continually filtered through a cluster of looping blood vessels, called a glomerulus, which allows the passage of water and small molecules but retains blood cells, proteins such as albumin, and larger molecules.
Attached to each glomerulus are tubes (tubules) that have a number of sections that collect the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomerulus, reabsorb what can be re-used by the body, add other molecules through a process called secretion and, finally, adjust the amount of water that is eventually eliminated along with the waste as urine.
Besides eliminating wastes and helping to regulate the amount of water in the body, these activities allow the kidneys to maintain normal chemical balance in the body. Among the important substances the kidneys help to regulate are sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. The right balance of these substances is critical. When the kidneys are not working properly, the concentrations of these substances in the blood may be abnormal and waste products and fluid may build up to dangerous levels in the blood, creating a life-threatening situation.
Kidneys also have a number of other miscellaneous roles in maintaining a healthy body, including the production of a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production (called erythropoietin), production of a hormone that helps maintain a normal blood pressure (called renin), and turning one form of vitamin D into a more active form, which enhances calcium absorption.

If the kidneys are not functioning properly, waste products can accumulate in the blood and fluid levels can increase to dangerous volumes, causing damage to the body or a potentially life-threatening situation. Numerous conditions and diseases can result in damage to the kidneys. The most common causes of and main risk factors for kidney disease are diabetes and hypertension. For more on the types and causes, see the article on Kidney Disease.
The individual tests included in a renal panel can vary by laboratory, but the tests typically performed include:
Electrolytes – electrically charged chemicals that are vital to normal body processes, such as nerve and muscle function; among other things, they help regulate the amount of fluid in the body and maintain the acid-base balance. Electrolytes include:

Sodium
Potassium
Chloride
Bicarbonate (Total CO2)

Minerals

Phosphorus – a mineral that is vital for energy production, muscle and nerve function, and bone growth; it also plays an important role as a buffer, helping to maintain the body's acid-base balance.
Calcium – one of the most important minerals in the body; it essential for the proper functioning of muscles, nerves, and the heart and is required in blood clotting and in the formation of bones.

Protein

Albumin – a protein that makes up about 60% of protein in the blood and has many roles such as keeping fluid from leaking out of blood vessels and transporting hormones, vitamins, drugs, and ions like calcium throughout the body.

Waste products

Urea/Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) – urea is a nitrogen-containing waste product that forms from the metabolism of protein; it is released by the liver into the blood and is carried to the kidneys, where it is filtered out of the blood and eliminated in the urine.
Creatinine – another waste product that is produced by the body's muscles; almost all creatinine is eliminated by the kidneys.

Energy Source

Glucose – supplies energy for the body; a steady amount must be available for use, and a relatively constant level of glucose must be maintained in the blood.

Three calculated values may also be reported with a renal panel:

Urea (BUN)/Creatinine Ratio – a comparison of urea (nitrogen) to creatinine content in the blood
Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) – a calculated estimate of the actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR, the amount of blood filtered by the glomeruli in the kidneys per minute) derived from creatinine levels in the blood; the formula takes into account the person's age, gender, race, and sometimes height and weight.
Anion Gap – anion gap (AG or AGAP) is a value calculated using the results of an electrolyte panel. It evaluates the difference between measured and unmeasured electrical particles (ions or electrolytes) in the fluid portion of the blood.

Urine that is foamy, bloody, or coffee-colored
A decrease in the amount of urine
Problems urinating, such as a burning feeling or abnormal discharge during urination, or a change in the frequency of urination, especially at night
Mid-back pain, below the ribs, near where the kidneys are located
	 

A renal panel may also be ordered at regular intervals when someone is being treated for kidney disease for monitoring purposes.

A variety of viruses and some bacteria can cause infections of the respiratory tract. These disease-causing microbes are called pathogens. The respiratory pathogens panel tests for the presence of multiple disease-causing microbes in a single respiratory sample.
While a wide variety of viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory infections, the list of common ones is much smaller. A healthcare practitioner may have an idea about the cause based upon the season, your signs and symptoms and medical history, and in some cases recent travel, but will not be able to positively identify the microbe without testing.
The respiratory pathogen panel is a molecular test that detects the genetic material (RNA or DNA) of some of the more common pathogens. It can identify co-infections (more than one microbe causing infection) and identify microbes that might be missed with traditional testing, such as culture. Some panels can also identify subtypes or strains of microbes. Results of a respiratory pathogen panel may be available within a few hours, compared to a few days with some traditional testing.
The number and type of microbes tested depends on the specific panel used. Some panels are limited to testing for a few types of viruses that are the most common causes of respiratory infections, while other panels are more comprehensive and test for a wider variety of respiratory viruses and bacteria in a single sample.
Examples of some of the microbes that might be tested include (these can vary from one panel to another):
Viruses:

Influenza A and B (flu)
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Parainfluenza virus
Rhinovirus
Adenovirus
Coronavirus
Enterovirus
Human metapneumovirus

Bacteria:

Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough) and Bordetella parapertussis
Chlamydia pneumoniae
Mycoplasma pneumoniae

Respiratory infections
Respiratory infections are common and can be very contagious, spreading from person to person through coughing, sneezing, and contact with contaminated surfaces. People may be infectious before their symptoms begin to several days after they become sick.
Some examples of common respiratory infections include:

Common colds—viral infections that cause sneezing, coughing, sore throat and runny or stuffy nose
Bronchitis—infections can cause inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs (bronchial tubes) with symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath
Croup—an infection of the windpipe and airways leading to the lungs that causes hoarseness and a cough that sounds like a seal or dog
Pneumonia—infection of the lower respiratory tract that can cause coughing, fever, chills, muscle aches and shortness of breath

Viral respiratory infections caused by influenza A or B (the flu) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are largely seasonal in the United States, with the cold and flu season running from late fall through early spring. During each season there are multiple strains of influenza and a variety of other viruses causing very similar ""flu-like"" symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose the cause of infection based on symptoms and medical history alone. Some viruses and bacteria can cause respiratory infections and complications year-round.
Respiratory infections can cause a spectrum of illness, from mild to severe, and can sometimes be fatal. All ages can be affected, but the highest infection rates and the most severe complications are typically seen in the very young, in people with weakened (compromised) immune systems, and especially in the elderly. People in close contact with one another or in confined spaces, such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and the military, are also at increased risk of infection.
The number of people with respiratory infections varies from year to year. For instance, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

Influenza: the number of cases of influenza illness during the 2017-2018 season was the highest it had been since 2009. The CDC estimates that 48.8 million people became sick with influenza, about 959,000 were hospitalized, and 79,400 died.
RSV: on average there are 2.1 million outpatient visits and 57,527 hospitalizations in children under the age of 5, and 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults older than the age of 65.
Common cold: millions of cases of the common cold occur each year (typically caused by rhinoviruses, but also by other viruses included in the respiratory pathogen panel).

Results are typically interpreted in conjunction with your signs and symptoms and medical history.
A positive result means that the microbe detected is likely causing your signs and symptoms. If more than one result is positive, you may be infected with more than one microbe (co-infection). The following are some exceptions:

The panels detect the presence of genetic material of the microbes and do not distinguish between dead and living ones. Sometimes, a positive result reflects the presence of dead microbes that are not the cause of infection.
Sometimes, a positive test result for multiple microbes may mean that one of the microbes is in your respiratory tract but is not the cause of the current symptoms.
Rarely, a result may be positive when the microbe is not present (false positive). Also, a result may be positive when a different microbe is present. Although uncommon, this can happen when the microbes are genetically similar.
	 

A negative result means that the microbes tested were not detected and your signs and symptoms may be caused by a virus or bacterium not included in the panel or by another condition. The following are some exceptions:

Viruses can be shed intermittently. This means that the number of viruses present in your respiratory sample can vary greatly during an infection. A negative result may mean that the microbe causing your infection was not present or not present in high enough numbers to be detected in the sample that was collected.
It is also important that the sample is collected properly to pick up any microbes that might be present. The nasopharyngeal swab should touch the back of your nose and throat and may bring tears to your eyes when done correctly.
Rarely, you may have a respiratory infection caused by one of the microbes, but the test does not detect it because the amount of viral or bacterial genetic material present in your sample was too small.
	 

If results are negative and symptoms persist and/or if suspicion of an infection remains high, then other tests may be done to help establish a diagnosis.



","



When a healthcare practitioner has a strong suspicion as to the cause of an infection, then a test for a specific microbe may be ordered instead of a panel. Some examples include:

A person has symptoms of whooping cough (cause by Bordetella pertussis infection) and an outbreak is happening in the community; a pertussis test may be performed.
A baby has symptoms and RSV and influenza have been identified in the community; those individual tests may be performed.




","



Respiratory pathogens panels may be used to help diagnose the cause of your respiratory infection and help guide treatment. They are used primarily for people who are seriously ill, hospitalized, and/or are at an increased risk for a severe infection with complications or multiple infections at the same time (co-infection).
Many individuals with respiratory infections are never tested because:

Many respiratory infections in otherwise healthy people resolve with no specific treatment and with only supportive care (e.g., getting plenty of rest and drinking plenty of fluids).
When it is strongly suspected you have the flu (it is flu season and the flu is widespread in your community), your healthcare practitioner may make the diagnosis based on your symptoms and treat you with an antiviral medication.
	 

For people with serious illness or at risk of complications, respiratory pathogen panels can help determine whether an infection is due to a virus or bacteria that can be treated with medication.

The panels can diagnose the flu and rule out other illnesses. This can reduce the chances of people using unnecessary antibiotics (which are not effective for viral infections), while increasing the chances that they will receive anti-viral therapy early in the illness, when it is most effective.
Some panels can diagnose infections caused by bacteria that may require treatment with antibiotics.
	 

Respiratory pathogen panels are not used to test all respiratory infections or symptomatic patients. Other types of tests include:

Individual molecular tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other respiratory viruses and bacteria may be performed at the point of care, such as a healthcare practitioner's office or medical clinic.
Rapid antigen tests for influenza and RSV may also be at the point of care during cold and flu season, even though they can be less sensitive than newer molecular tests.
	 

Since the respiratory pathogen panels are relatively new and relatively expensive to perform, laboratories and healthcare providers are still in the process of determining how to use them to provide the optimum care for patients. Additional tests may be done if a microbe is not identified by the panel and/or if there is a suspicion of a microbe other than those included in the panel.

","



Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a very contagious, common viral respiratory infection. RSV testing detects the presence of respiratory syncytial virus in nasal secretions to help diagnose the infection.
Most people recover from an RSV infection without any specific treatment or having to see a healthcare practitioner to get tested. However, testing may be done for infants, young children with heart or lung problems, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems because they are particularly vulnerable. In these high-risk groups, RSV can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis, a condition that causes inflammation of the small airways of the lungs.
Signs and symptoms of RSV infection are similar to those of other respiratory infections and usually appear 4 to 6 days after someone comes into contact with the virus. Signs and symptoms may include:

Runny nose
Coughing, sneezing
Reduced appetite
Fever
Wheezing
In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, sluggishness (inactivity), and difficulty breathing

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost everyone has been infected with RSV by the time they are 2 years old. It is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in young children in the U.S. and globally.
Though usually causing a mild illness, RSV can be serious in some children and adults. Each year in the U.S., RSV leads to about:

2.1 million outpatient visits and 57,000 hospitalizations among children younger than 5 years old
177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths among adults older than 65 years

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally there may be as many as 30 million RSV lower respiratory infections in children younger than 5 years old, resulting in than 3.4 million hospitalizations each year.
RSV that tends to be seasonal, causing community epidemics in the fall, winter, and spring. Outbreaks typically begin to occur in November or December and decrease by early spring.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Sample collection technique is critical in RSV testing. The best and most frequently used sample is a nasal aspirate or wash. A syringe is used to push a small amount of sterile saline into the nose, then gentle suction is applied (for the aspirate) or the resulting fluid is collected into a cup (for a wash).
Sometimes, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab is used, although it is not preferred because the amount of virus obtained on a swab is usually low. The NP swab is collected by having a person tip his or her head back, then a Dacron swab (like a long Q-tip) is gently inserted into one of the nostrils until resistance is met (about 1 to 2 inches in), then rotated several times and withdrawn. This is not painful, but it may tickle a bit and cause the person's eyes to tear.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When it is RSV season (late fall through early spring in the U.S.) and an infant, an elderly person, or a person with a weakened immune system has a moderate to severe respiratory infection and symptoms such as runny nose, congestion, coughing and/or difficulty breathing


","



RSV tests are ordered almost exclusively during ""cold and flu season"" – late fall to early spring. They are ordered when someone, usually an infant or elderly person, has a serious lower respiratory infection and signs and symptoms, such as:

Wheezing
Severe coughing
Rapid breathing (primarily in infants)
Fevers
Headaches
Runny, stuffy nose
Sore throat

Testing must be done within the first few days of infection and the appearance of signs and symptoms because detectable amounts of virus are usually shed during the early phase of infection.
When RSV has already been identified in the community, a healthcare practitioner may order a rapid RSV test to confirm the suspected diagnosis in a symptomatic person.



","



If an RSV test is positive, then it is likely that the person has a respiratory syncytial virus infection. A positive test can also confirm the presence of RSV in the community. A positive RSV test cannot, however, tell a healthcare practitioner how severe a person's symptoms are likely to be or how long ago the patient was infected. Symptoms usually appear 4-6 days after infection.
Negative RSV tests may mean that the person tested has something other than RSV or that there is not sufficient virus in the sample to be detected. This may be due to either a poor specimen collection or because the person is not shedding detectable levels of virus into his or her respiratory secretions. Adults tend to shed less virus than infants do, and those who have had RSV for several days will shed less than those with a more recent infection.



","



Most RSV infections will resolve within 1 or 2 weeks. People can be re-infected with different strains of RSV from year to year, although subsequent infections tend to be less severe than the first/primary infection. Since most RSV infections are mild, symptoms from these re-infections are usually attributed to ""a cold."" These cases of RSV are usually not formally diagnosed and are often treated with over-the-counter cold remedies for symptom relief.



",,"



Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) testing is usually used during the RSV season to help diagnose the infection in people with moderate to severe symptoms and lower respiratory tract infection. It is primarily ordered for infants between the ages of 6 months and 2 years, the elderly, and those with weakened (compromised) immune systems, such as those who have pre-existing lung disease or who have had an organ transplant. 
RSV testing is not routinely performed for older children and the rest of the general population because most of them will experience only relatively mild upper respiratory infections with symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, coughing, sore throat, and fever.
RSV testing may be used to document and track the spread of RSV in the community. Public health efforts are focused on containing and preventing the spread of RSV as much as possible to minimize the chance of spreading the virus to high-risk people. Those with mild symptoms may only be tested for RSV if it is necessary to help track its spread. Influenza testing may also be done if both viruses are known to be present in the community.
A few types of RSV tests are available for use:

Rapid RSV antigen testing—this is by far the most common test. Rapid RSV antigen tests are frequently performed on-site, in the healthcare practitioner's office or the emergency room, with most results available within an hour. In some cases, the sample may be collected and sent to a laboratory for a more sensitive testing method. Results of these RSV tests are usually available the same day.
RSV RT-PCR—this is a molecular test that detects the genetic material of the virus. It is generally more sensitive than antigen testing or viral culture. It may be used in conjunction with other tests to detect other viral infections that may cause signs and symptoms similar to RSV.
Viral cultures—these are used to grow and identify the RSV virus. Viral cultures can identify the RSV virus and other respiratory viruses that may be present. Availability of viral cultures is decreasing as most laboratories adopt molecular assays to detect viral infections. Viral cultures are costly and more difficult to perform and take days to provide a result, which makes them less clinically useful for evaluating an individual.

Other tests that may be done in conjunction with RSV testing include:

Influenza tests
Group A strep test, to detect the streptococcal bacteria that causes strep throat

To help your healthcare practitioner evaluate your bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells (RBCs); to help distinguish between various causes of anemia; to help monitor bone marrow response and the return of normal marrow function following chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant, or post-treatment follow-up for iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency anemia, or renal failure


","

A blood sample is collected by inserting a needle into a vein in your arm or sometimes from a fingerstick or heelstick (infant).


","



Reticulocytes are newly produced, relatively immature red blood cells (RBCs). A reticulocyte count helps to determine the number and/or percentage of reticulocytes in the blood and is a reflection of recent bone marrow function or activity.
Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, where blood-forming (hematopoietic) stem cells differentiate and develop, eventually forming reticulocytes and finally becoming mature RBCs. Reticulocytes are visually, slightly larger than mature RBCs. Unlike most other cells in the body, mature RBCs have no nucleus, but reticulocytes still have some remnant genetic material (RNA). As reticulocytes mature, they lose the last residual RNA and most are fully developed within one day of being released from the bone marrow into the blood. The reticulocyte count or percentage is a good indicator of the ability of a person's bone marrow to adequately produce red blood cells (erythropoiesis).
RBCs typically survive for about 120 days in circulation, and the bone marrow is continually producing new RBCs to replace those that age and degrade or are lost through bleeding. Normally, a stable number of RBCs is maintained in the blood through continual replacement of degraded or lost RBCs.
A variety of diseases and conditions can affect the production of new RBCs and/or their survival, in addition to those conditions that may result in significant bleeding. These conditions may lead to a rise or drop in the number of RBCs and may affect the reticulocyte count.
Higher than normal percentage of reticulocytes: Acute or chronic bleeding (hemorrhage) or increased RBC destruction (hemolysis) can lead to fewer RBCs in the blood, resulting in anemia. The body compensates for this loss or to treatment of deficiency anemias (such as iron deficiency anemia or pernicious anemia) by increasing the rate of RBC production and by releasing RBCs sooner into the blood, before they become more mature. When this happens, the number and percentage of reticulocytes in the blood increases until a sufficient number of RBCs replaces those that were lost or until the production capacity of the bone marrow is reached.
Lower than normal percentage of reticulocytes: Decreased RBC production may occur when the bone marrow is not functioning normally. This can result from a bone marrow disorder such as aplastic anemia. Diminished production can also be due to other factors, for example, cirrhosis of the liver, kidney disease, radiation or chemotherapy treatments for cancer, a low level of the hormone erythropoietin, or deficiencies in certain nutrients such as iron, vitamin B12 or folate. Decreased production leads to fewer RBCs in circulation, decreased hemoglobin and oxygen-carrying capacity, a lower hematocrit, and a reduced number of reticulocytes as old RBCs are removed from the blood but not fully replaced.
Occasionally, both the reticulocyte count and the RBC count will be increased because of excess RBC production by the bone marrow. This may be due to an increased production of erythropoietin, disorders that cause chronic overproduction of RBCs (polycythemia vera), and cigarette smoking.
Some drugs may increase or decrease reticulocyte counts.

When results of a complete blood count (CBC) show you have a low RBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit and/or when you have symptoms of anemia; when your healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate your bone marrow function


","



A reticulocyte count may be ordered when:

CBC results show a decreased RBC count and/or a decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit
A healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate bone marrow function
You have signs and symptoms of anemia or chronic bleeding, such as paleness, lack of energy, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and/or blood in the stool
You have been diagnosed and are being treated for a condition known to affect RBC production, such as iron deficiency anemia, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, or kidney disease (which can affect the production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates RBC production by the bone marrow)
You are undergoing radiation or chemotherapy
You have received a bone marrow transplant
Occasionally when you have an increased number of RBCs and elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit, to help determine the degree and rate of overproduction of RBCs




","



Results must be interpreted carefully and along with results of other tests, such as a red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), or full CBC. In general, the reticulocyte count (absolute number or percentage) is a reflection of recent bone marrow activity. Results may indicate whether a disease or condition is present that is generating an increased demand for new RBCs and whether the bone marrow is able to respond to the extra requirement. Occasionally, results may indicate overproduction of RBCs.
When anemia is present (i.e., low RBCs, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit) and the bone marrow is responding appropriately to the demand for increased numbers of RBCs, then the bone marrow will produce more and allow for the early release of more immature RBCs, increasing the number of reticulocytes in the blood.
A high reticulocyte count with low RBCs, low hemoglobin, and low hematocrit (anemia) may indicate conditions such as:

Bleeding: If you bleed, then the number of reticulocytes will rise a few days later in an attempt to compensate for the red cell loss. If you have chronic blood loss, then the number of reticulocytes will stay at an increased level as the marrow tries to keep up with the demand for new RBCs (although it may not be high if the blood loss leads to iron deficiency).
Hemolytic anemia: In this condition, anemia is caused by increased destruction of RBCs. The bone marrow increases RBC production to compensate, resulting in a high reticulocyte count.
Hemolytic disease of the newborn: This condition causes increased RBC destruction, similar to hemolytic anemia described above.

A low reticulocyte count with low RBCs, low hemoglobin, and low hematocrit (anemia) may be seen, for example, with:

Iron deficiency anemia
Pernicious anemia or folic acid deficiency
Aplastic anemia
Radiation therapy
Bone marrow failure caused by infection or cancer
Severe kidney disease; this may cause a low level of erythropoietin.
Alcoholism
Endocrine disease

When you have anemia, the percent of reticulocytes present in the blood may appear high compared to the overall number of RBCs. In order to get a more accurate assessment of bone marrow function, a calculation called a corrected reticulocyte count may be reported.
Corrected reticulocyte count (%) = reticulocyte (%) x [patient HCT(%)/45]
45 is considered the average normal hematocrit (HCT).
Other calculations that may also be reported include the reticulocyte production index (RPI) and an immature reticulocyte fraction (IRF). The IRF was previously referred to as the reticulocyte maturity index; however, IRF is now the most common term used to quantify the younger fraction of reticulocytes. (For more on these, see below.)
The reticulocyte test gives an indication of the presence of a disease or condition but is not directly diagnostic of any one particular disease. It is a sign that further investigation may be necessary and a tool that can be used to monitor the effectiveness of therapy.
If reticulocyte numbers rise following chemotherapy, a bone marrow transplant, or treatment of an iron or vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, then bone marrow RBC production is beginning to recover.
When you do not have anemia, or have a high RBC count (polycythemia), a high reticulocyte count may indicate an overproduction of RBCs. Some conditions that may cause this include:

Polycythemia vera
Tumor that produces excess erythropoietin




","



People who move to higher altitudes may have slightly higher reticulocyte counts for a while as their body adapts to the lower oxygen content of their new location. Smokers also may demonstrate an increased number of RBCs and reticulocytes.
Reticulocyte counts may be high during pregnancy. Newborns have a higher percentage of reticulocytes, but the number drops to near adult levels within a few weeks of birth.
Traditionally, reticulocyte counts have been done manually by looking at a specially stained slide under the microscope and counting the number of reticulocytes in a number of fields of view. Although it is used occasionally, the manual method has been replaced by automated methods that allow for a greater number of cells to be counted, thus enhancing the accuracy of reticulocyte counts. The automated method is considered to be more accurate in identifying reticulocytes.



","



A reticulocyte count is used to determine the number and/or percentage of reticulocytes in the blood to help evaluate conditions that affect red blood cells (RBCs), such as anemia or bone marrow disorders. Reticulocytes are newly produced, relatively immature red blood cells. They form and mature in the bone marrow before being released into the blood.
The reticulocyte count may be used:

As a follow up to abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC), RBC count, hemoglobin or hematocrit, to help determine the cause
To determine if the bone marrow is functioning properly and responding adequately to the body's need for red blood cells
To help detect and distinguish between different types of anemia
To monitor response to treatment, such as that for iron-deficiency anemia
To monitor bone marrow function following treatments such as chemotherapy
To monitor function following a bone marrow transplant

Most often, a reticulocyte count is performed with an automated instrument (hematology analyzer) and can be done simultaneously with a CBC, which includes an RBC count, hemoglobin and hematocrit. Either an absolute number of reticulocytes and/or a percentage of reticulocytes can be reported. For a percentage, the number of reticulocytes counted manually is compared to the total number of RBCs:
Reticulocyte (%) = number of reticulocytes X 100 / 1000 (RBCs counted)
For healthcare providers who want to have a definitive number of reticulocytes, they can order an Absolute Reticulocyte Count (ARC):
ARC = reticulocytes (%) x RBC count (x 1012/L) / 100

Rheumatoid factor (RF) is an autoantibody, an immunoglobulin M (IgM) protein that is produced by the body's immune system. Autoantibodies attack a person's own tissues, mistakenly identifying the tissue as ""foreign."" While the biologic role of RF is not well understood, its presence is useful as an indicator of inflammatory and autoimmune activity. This test detects and measures RF in the blood and may be used, along with other tests, to help in the diagnose of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
RA is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation, pain, stiffness, and destructive changes in the hands, feet, and other joints throughout the body. Some patients may show signs of fatigue, low-grade fevers, and weight loss.
It can affect anyone at any age but usually develops in the late child-bearing years in women and between the ages of 60 to 80 in men. Over 70% of those affected with RA are women. The course of RA and its prognosis are variable. It may develop and progress slowly or rapidly. It may go into remission in some people and, in a few, it may go away. Left untreated, RA can shorten a person's lifespan and can, within a few years, leave many of those affected too disabled to work.
There are a variety of treatments available to minimize the complications of RA, but they depend on making an accurate diagnosis and on beginning treatment before the development of significant joint damage. 
Rheumatoid factor has been used to detect RA. Because the sensitivity and specificity of RF are not ideal, other laboratory tests are often performed in conjunction with RF testing. About 80% of those with RA will have a positive RF test, but it can be negative in people who have clinical signs of RA.
A test for cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (CCP) may be done along with an RF test as studies have shown that the CCP antibody test has a sensitivity and specificity that is considered better than RF and is more likely to be positive with early RA. Other tests that may be performed are:

Complete blood count (CBC, for anemia & thrombocytosis)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)
Synovial fluid analysis (inflammatory joints)

Elevated RF can be found in a small percentage (5-10%) of healthy people. RF may also be elevated in the elderly, though they may not demonstrate clinical signs. In addition, elevated levels of RF may be detected in people who do not have RA (false positive) but may have another disorder:

Sjögren syndrome
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections (hepatitis, TB, syphilis, leprosy)
Certain cancers
Lung disease, liver disease, and kidney disease

The test for RF may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms of RA. Symptoms may include:

Pain, warmth, swelling, and morning stiffness in the joints 
Nodules under the skin 
If the disease has progressed, evidence on X-rays of swollen joint capsules and loss of cartilage and bone 

 
An RF test may be repeated when the first test is negative and symptoms persist.



","



The RF test must be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory tests and a person's signs, symptoms, and clinical history. RF is present in 70%-90% of patients with RA, though is not diagnostic of RA.
In those with symptoms and clinical signs of rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of significant concentrations of RF indicates that it is likely that they have RA. Higher levels of RF generally correlate with more severe disease and a poorer prognosis.
A negative RF test does not rule out RA. About 20% of people with RA will have very low levels of or no detectable RF. In these cases, a CCP antibody test may be positive and used to confirm RA.



","



The 2010 Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) includes cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody testing, along with RF, as part of its criteria for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis. According to the ACR, CCP antibodies may be detected in about 50-60% of people with early RA, as early as 3-6 months after the beginning of symptoms. Early detection and diagnosis of RA allows healthcare practitioners to begin aggressive treatment of the condition, minimizing the associated complications and tissue damage.



",,"



The rheumatoid factor (RF) test is used in conjunction with other laboratory tests and imaging tests (X-rays, ultrasound, MRI) to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and to help distinguish RA from other forms of arthritis or other conditions that cause similar symptoms.
While diagnosis of RA relies heavily on the clinical picture, some of the signs and symptoms may not be present or follow a typical pattern, especially early in the disease. Furthermore, the signs and symptoms may not always be clearly identifiable since people with RA may also have other connective tissue disorders or conditions, such as Raynaud phenomenon, scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid disorders, and systemic lupus erythematosis, and display symptoms of these disorders as well. The RF test is one tool among others that can be used to help make a diagnosis when RA is suspected.

","



Rubella is a virus that causes an infection that is usually mild and characterized by fever and rash that last about 2 to 3 days. The Infection is highly contagious but is preventable with a vaccine. A rubella test detects and measures rubella antibodies in the blood that are produced by the body's immune system in response to immunization or an infection by the rubella virus.
Clinical diagnosis of rubella is unreliable; therefore, cases must be laboratory-confirmed. Antibody tests are the most common methods of confirming the diagnosis of rubella.
The rubella virus generally causes a mild infection marked by a fine red rash that appears on the face and neck and then travels to the trunk and limbs before disappearing a few days later. The virus is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing and sneezing. The infection can cause symptoms such as fever, enlarged lymph nodes, runny nose, red eyes, and joint pain. Symptoms may be so minimal, especially in children, that they go unnoticed and people do not know that they have a viral illness. In most people, rubella goes away within a couple of days without any special medical treatment and usually causes no further health issues.
The primary concern with rubella infection is when a pregnant woman contracts it for the first time during the first three months of her pregnancy. The developing baby (fetus) is most vulnerable to the virus at this time. If rubella is passed from a mother to her unborn baby, it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS), a group of serious birth defects that will permanently affect the child. CRS can cause intellectual and development disabilities, deafness, cloudiness of the lens of the eyes (cataracts), an abnormally small head, liver problems, and heart defects.
Because of the severe consequences for unborn babies, a national campaign was started in 1969 to immunize all children in the United States and to work to eradicate rubella infection, first in the U.S. and then throughout the world. The rubella vaccine is contained in a combination vaccine called MMR, which stands for measles, mumps and rubella. All children should receive two doses of MMR, the first dose at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age.
Prior to 1969 and routine vaccinations, rubella infections would emerge as cyclic outbreaks that lasted for several years. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), during the 1962-1965 rubella epidemic, 12.5 million cases of rubella occurred in the U.S. and there were 20,000 infants born with CRS. Due to vaccination efforts, these numbers have decreased drastically. The number of reported cases of rubella in the United States has declined dramatically to a median of 11 cases annually in 2005-2011. 
The CDC now declares endemic rubella to be eradicated in the U.S., although people traveling from other countries bring it to the U.S. and the incidence continues to be monitored. People should not become complacent with this reduction, however, and the CDC cautions people to continue to have their children vaccinated. Anyone who has not received the vaccination as a child (and a few that have) may still be vulnerable to rubella infection.
Pregnant women and women considering pregnancy continue to be routinely tested for rubella antibodies to ensure that they are immune.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is drawn from a vein in the arm of an adult or from a heelprick or the umbilical cord of a newborn.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

","



The IgG rubella test is ordered when a woman is pregnant or is planning on becoming pregnant. It is ordered whenever a check for immunity against rubella is required. IgM and IgG rubella tests may be ordered when a pregnant woman has signs and symptoms that may indicate a rubella infection.
Some signs and symptoms include:

Mild fever
A pink rash that begins on the face and then spreads downward to the body and then the legs and arms; once it begins to spread to the body, the rash may disappear from the face.
Runny or stuffy nose
Red or inflamed eyes
Aching joints
Swollen lymph nodes

Since many conditions can cause similar symptoms, a health practitioner will need to order the tests in order to confirm the diagnosis.
IgM and IgG tests may be ordered for a newborn when the mother was diagnosed with a rubella infection during pregnancy and/or when a newborn is born with birth defects such as hearing loss, heart defects, or cloudy lens of the eyes (cataracts) that could be due to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).
Since rubella antibodies take some time to appear after infection, the tests may be repeated after day 5 of illness onset (IgM) and 7-21 days after the first specimen (IgG) to see if the antibody levels have become detectable (when initially absent) and to determine whether the levels are rising or falling over time.
This test may be required of a healthcare worker or a person starting college and is still ordered for women in some states as part of the blood testing required to obtain a marriage license.



","



Adult or Child
In an adult or child, the absence of IgG rubella antibodies means that the person likely has not been exposed to the rubella virus or been vaccinated and is not protected against it.
The presence of IgG antibodies but not IgM antibodies indicates a history of past exposure to the virus or vaccination and indicates that the person tested should be immune to the rubella virus.
The presence of IgM antibodies, with or without IgG antibodies, in a child or adult indicates a recent infection with the rubella virus.
Newborn
The presence of IgG antibodies, but not IgM antibodies, in a newborn means that the mother's IgG antibodies have passed to the baby in utero and these antibodies may protect the infant from rubella infection, although they should decrease by four- to eight-fold by three months of age and should disappear by 6 to 12 months of age.
The presence of IgM antibodies in a newborn indicates that the baby was infected during pregnancy because the mother's IgM antibodies do not pass to the baby through the umbilical cord.
The table below summarizes some results that might be seen:

Because rubella incidence is low, a person may have a false-positive test for IgM rubella antibodies due to infection with other viruses or the test components are cross-reacting with other proteins in the body. To confirm the IgM result, the health practitioner may order an IgG test to establish a baseline level of antibody and may repeat the IgG test again (tested together with the first specimen) in 7-21 days to look for a significant increase in the amount (titer) present, indicating a recent rubella infection.

In addition to antibody tests, the evidence of recent rubella infection is a positive viral culture for rubella or detection of rubella virus by testing for the genetic material (RNA) of the rubella virus in a body fluid sample, such as a throat swab. Because these procedures are complex, time-consuming and expensive, most diagnostic laboratories refer this testing to a reference lab such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The number of cases of rubella and congenital rubella is monitored by the CDC to track the effectiveness of the rubella vaccine and to detect any outbreaks of the disease.



",,"



The rubella test is used to detect antibodies in the blood that develop in response to a rubella infection or immunization. Rubella testing may be used to:

Confirm the presence of adequate protection against the rubella virus (immunity)
Detect a recent or past infection
Identify those who have never been exposed to the virus and those who have not been vaccinated
Verify that all pregnant women and those planning to become pregnant have a sufficient amount (titer) of rubella antibodies to protect them from infection

Rubella is a viral infection that is usually mild and marked by fever and rash that last about 2 to 3 days. The infection usually resolves without treatment. However, if a pregnant woman contracts it for the first time during the first three months of her pregnancy, rubella can cause serious complications in the developing baby (fetus). (For more on this, read the ""What is being tested?"" section.)
A rubella test may be ordered for a person, pregnant or not, who has symptoms that a health practitioner suspects are due to a rubella infection. It may also be ordered for a newborn who is suspected to have become infected during pregnancy or that presents with congenital birth defects that a health practitioner suspects may be due to a rubella infection.
There are two types of rubella antibodies that lab tests can detect, IgM and IgG:

The first type to appear in the blood after exposure is the IgM rubella antibody. The level of this protein rises and peaks in the blood within about 7 to 10 days after infection and then tapers off over the next few weeks, except in an infected newborn, in whom it may be detected for several months to a year.
The IgG rubella antibody takes a bit longer to appear than the IgM, but once it does, it stays in the bloodstream for life, providing protection against re-infection. The presence of IgM rubella antibodies in the blood indicates a recent infection while the presence of IgG antibodies may indicate a recent or past rubella infection, or indicate that a rubella vaccine (a measles, mumps, rubella vaccine) has been given and is providing adequate protection.

The IgM rubella test is the standard test for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of rubella. Detection of a rise in IgG rubella in blood samples collected when a person is acutely ill and then as the person begins to recover (convalescent phase) can be used to confirm infection. The antibody tests vary among laboratories and the state health department can provide guidance on available laboratory services and preferred tests.

None, but your healthcare practitioner may ask when you last took a salicylate and the amount taken. To accurately interpret results, blood samples are usually drawn at least 4 hours after ingestion. If you regularly take a prescription salicylate, your healthcare practitioner may want to collect blood just prior to your next dose (trough level). Tell your healthcare provider about any other prescribed or over-the-counter medications you are taking.

To detect salicylate overdose, to help evaluate its severity and monitor its resolution; sometimes to monitor for an overdose if you regularly use prescription-strength salicylates

A blood sample drawn from a vein and/or sometimes a urine sample collected in a clean container


","



Salicylates are a group of drugs, including aspirin, available as both prescription and non-prescription (over-the-counter) medications. They are often used to relieve pain and inflammation, to reduce fever, and to prevent excessive blood clotting. Salicylate testing measures the concentration in the blood to detect and/or monitor an overdose (salicylate poisoning).
Salicylates are available as pills or tablets taken by mouth or as topical creams absorbed through the skin. Aspirin is the most common salicylate taken as tablets or pills.

Over-the-counter salicylates are used as needed or regularly to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation.
Low doses of aspirin may be taken on a regular basis to reduce the chance of inappropriate blood clotting (thrombosis), heart attack, or stroke in people who have a high risk of developing these disorders. Low-dose aspirin may also be used to prevent worsening of cardiovascular disease and/or complications in someone who is having a heart attack or who recently experienced one. However, aspirin for cardiovascular disease prevention is no longer recommended in patients 70 or older, or those with bleeding disorders.
Aspirin is also used in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (e.g., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia) to prevent blood clot formation.
Uncommonly, prescription-strength aspirin may be used to relieve symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis as well as symptoms of autoimmune disorders such as lupus.

With single, normal doses, blood concentrations of salicylates typically peak in about 2 hours, but this may be delayed for 12 hours or more with ""enteric-coated"" or ""sustained-release"" preparations. If too much salicylate is consumed (acute poisoning with a large dose) or too much is taken over time (chronic poisoning), then associated signs and symptoms will develop.
Salicylates are metabolized by the liver and eliminated from the body in the urine. The ability to remove salicylates efficiently is affected by the body's blood and urine pH (acidity/alkalinity) and by kidney and liver function. People with impaired liver or kidney function may be more susceptible to salicylate toxicity.
Salicylate poisoning is a serious condition that often requires hospitalization and careful monitoring. In severe cases, the acid-base imbalance that it causes can worsen over time, causing electrolyte imbalances (hyperkalemia), low blood glucose, and dehydration, and leading to convulsions, hallucinations, delirium, coma and even death.
Both acute and chronic toxicity will present with similar symptoms, but chronic toxicity is associated with lower levels of salicylate. In addition, chronic toxicity is more likely to occur in the elderly, causing delirium, lack of energy, fluid build-up in the lungs (pulmonary edema), kidney failure, acid-base disorders, and/or abnormal electrolytes. Many of these symptoms are already present in elderly patients not taking salicylates, so detecting salicylate overdose/poisoning can be difficult.
When used with care and following dosing directions, therapeutic doses of salicylates are safe and effective for most adults. However, adults can run into trouble with salicylates when they unknowingly combine multiple products that contain them.

Many over-the-counter medications include a salicylate as one of the ingredients. If you are unaware of the ingredients, you can mistakenly take more than one of these drugs together, resulting in a cumulative effect and a high amount of ingested salicylate.
Widespread and easy availability of salicylate-containing medications can also mislead some to think that it is very safe and that ""more is better.""
An overdose can occur when you have pain that is not relieved with an initial dose and, unaware of the danger, take more than the recommended dose and/or take additional doses too soon.
In the elderly, these scenarios can especially be a problem because underlying conditions and general health status can decrease the ability to eliminate salicylates from the body.

Aspirin is not recommended for use in children and teens because of the risk of developing Reye syndrome, a disease characterized by acute brain damage, resulting in changes in behavior, nausea, vomiting, and liver dysfunction that can be fatal. Though youth are not routinely given aspirin, they may become poisoned through accidental or intentional ingestion. Topical creams that contain salicylates are of special concern as they contain very high doses.

When you have symptoms such as nausea, hyperventilation, ringing in the ears (tinnitus), irregular heart beat (arrhythmia), or confusion that may be from taking too much aspirin or medications with salicylate ingredients; when it is suspected that an unconscious person or a child may have ingested a significant quantity of a salicylate, often as part of emergency and overdose testing; at regular intervals when monitoring an overdose; sometimes on a regular basis if you take a prescription salicylate for rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorder


","



Salicylate testing may be ordered when it is suspected you have ingested a large amount of aspirin or other drugs containing salicylate. Usually, blood is drawn and tested at least 4 hours after last known ingestion. Results from tests done earlier than this are difficult to interpret.
Testing may be ordered when you have symptoms associated with an acute or chronic salicylate overdose. Typically, these symptoms will appear 3 to 8 hours after initial ingestion in cases of acute toxicity and may include:

Nausea and vomiting
Hyperventilation (rapid breathing); less common in children
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
Sweating
Dizziness
Confusion

Additional symptoms that may develop include:

Headache
Agitation
Convulsions, seizures
Hallucinations
Rapid heart rate
Lethargy
Coma
Deafness
Overheating (hyperthermia), especially in young children with severe toxicity
Shortness of breath due to fluid accumulation in the lungs (pulmonary edema)
Bleeding (rare)

Testing may be done when people are suspected of wanting to harm themselves (suicidal tendencies).
When acute salicylate toxicity is detected, a healthcare practitioner may order the test as frequently as every 2 to 3 hours to monitor the resolution of the overdose. Salicylate levels will continue to be monitored until there are two consecutive results that show a decrease from peak levels. Clinical signs of salicylate poisoning/toxicity will also be monitored frequently.
When you take regular doses of a prescribed salicylate, your healthcare practitioner may order this test on a routine basis to check for an elevated level since chronic toxicity may develop without obvious signs and symptoms, or with symptoms that develop slowly and are nonspecific (i.e., may be seen with many other conditions).



","



Normal therapeutic blood concentrations of aspirin and other salicylates depend upon what the drug is being used for, and blood levels must be interpreted along with your medical history and clinical signs and symptoms. Lower blood levels are sufficient for pain relief and to lower risk of blood clots, but higher levels may be required for managing inflammation in rheumatic conditions such as arthritis. At these higher levels, some side effects may become apparent.
The severity of signs and symptoms, and at what dose they appear, depends upon the individual. Symptoms may be seen with blood levels that are generally considered to be therapeutic in inflammatory conditions, and they will tend to appear in many people at levels of about 10-30 mg/dL. This is especially true in patients who may have kidney or liver disease. In general, the severity of salicylate toxicity increases with increasing concentrations.
The table below summarizes some results that may be seen. These numbers typically represent a blood sample that is collected at least 4 hours after last dose:



Salicylate result reported as mg/dL
Salicylate result reported as mcg/mL
Result Interpretation


 2-10
 20-100
Therapeutic level for pain relief (analgesia)


 10-30
 100-300
Anti-inflammatory level; some symptoms of toxicity may appear, such as headache, tinnitus, vertigo


Greater than 30 
Greater than 300 
Considered toxic



Note: Some laboratories report salicylates as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) while others report micrograms per milliliter (mcg/mL). These two are different by a factor of 10.
Rising levels (when you have not taken more salicylate) indicate that peak salicylate concentrations have not yet been reached. In an otherwise healthy person, peak salicylate levels occur 2 hours after ingestion. However, in cases of a large ingestion of pills or tablets, hard, solid masses (concretions or bezoars) can form, delaying the peak by six hours or more. A delay in peak levels can also occur if the person ingested ""enteric"" or ""sustained-release"" forms of salicylate.
Falling salicylate levels tend to indicate that the excess is being eliminated by the body and that the overdose is resolving. This is confirmed by two decreasing levels of salicylate once peak concentration has been reached.



","



Be aware that many prescription and nonprescription medications contain salicylates in combination with other medications. Do not take more than one medication that contains salicylates at a time.
Aspirin should not be taken long-term without consulting a healthcare practitioner and should NEVER be given to children or teens unless directed by a healthcare provider. Aspirin should not be taken with alcoholic drinks as this can increase the risk of bleeding from the stomach. If aspirin overdose is suspected, seek medical attention for the affected person.
Salicylates, including aspirin, are included in the group of drugs called NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). People with asthma and nasal polyps may be hypersensitive to salicylates and other NSAIDs. In addition, use of NSAIDs is not recommended in people with kidney or liver disease, bleeding disorders, other salicylate-containing drugs, and women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
A breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis) may sometimes occur as a complication of salicylate poisoning.



","



This test is used to detect a high level of salicylate in the blood. It may be used to:

Help diagnose an overdose (salicylate poisoning). It may be ordered along with other tests associated with emergency and overdose drug testing. The specific tests ordered will depend upon the symptoms and clinical signs.
Monitor levels over time if a toxic concentration is detected with initial testing. A series of salicylate tests may be ordered to determine whether the salicylate level has increased or has peaked and started to drop. This information is used to help monitor your health status and help guide treatment.
Monitor for an overdose if you take a prescription-strength salicylate, either to determine if the level is within a therapeutic range or to make sure you are not taking too much. This may be especially appropriate if your other medications, or health status, have changed.

semen-analysis,"['Sperm Analysis', 'Sperm Count', 'Seminal Fluid Analysis']","

For infertility testing, refrain from having sex or masturbation for 2-5 days before sample collection; carefully follow instructions provided.


","

As part of infertility testing if your partner is having trouble becoming pregnant or after a vasectomy to determine if the operation was successful


","

A semen sample collected in a sterile, wide-mouth container provided by the lab; often collected on-site, but sometimes it may be collected at home using a special condom obtained from a healthcare practitioner. For infertility testing, the sample must be analyzed within one hour of collection. Two separate collections on two separate days may be required.


","



A complete semen analysis measures the quantity and quality of the fluid released during ejaculation. It evaluates both the liquid portion, called semen or seminal fluid, and the microscopic, moving cells called sperm. It is often used in the evaluation of male infertility. A shorter version of this test checks solely for the presence of sperm in semen a few months after a man has had a vasectomy to determine whether the surgery was successful.
Semen is a viscous, whitish liquid that contains sperm and the products from several glands. It is fairly thick at ejaculation but thins out, or liquefies, within 10 to 30 minutes. Sperm are reproductive cells in semen that have a head, midsection, and a tail and contain one copy of each chromosome (all of the male's genes). Sperm are motile, normally moving forward through the semen. Inside a woman's body, this property enables them to travel to and fuse with the female's egg, resulting in fertilization. Each semen sample is between 1.5 and 5.5 milliliters (about one teaspoon) of fluid, containing at least 20 million sperm per milliliter, and varying amounts of fructose (a sugar), buffers, coagulating substances, lubricants, and enzymes that are intended to support the sperm and the fertilization process.
A typical semen analysis measures:

Volume of semen
Viscosity—consistency or thickness of the semen
Sperm count—total number of sperm
Sperm concentration (density)—number of sperm per volume of semen
Sperm motility—percent able to move as well as how vigorously and straight the sperm move
Number or percent of normal and abnormal (defective) sperm in terms of size and shape (morphology)
Coagulation and liquefaction—how quickly the semen turns from thick consistency to liquid
Fructose—a sugar in semen that gives energy to sperm
pH—measures acidity
Number of immature sperm
Number of white blood cells (cells that indicate infection)

Additional tests may be performed if the sperm count is low, if the sperm show decreased motility or abnormal morphology, or if the seminal fluid is found to be abnormal. These additional tests may help identify abnormalities such as the presence of sperm antibodies, abnormal hormone levels (testosterone, FSH, LH, prolactin), excessive number of white blood cells, and genetic tests for conditions that may affect fertility, such as Klinefelter syndrome, cystic fibrosis, or other chromosomal abnormality.
In some instances, imaging tests such as ultrasound, CAT scan, or MRI may be required. A biopsy of the testicle may also be needed. Sometimes a test called cryosurvival is done to see how well semen will survive for long-term storage if a couple would like to store sperm for future pregnancies.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Post-vasectomy sperm check: a semen sample is collected in a clean, wide-mouth container provided by the lab.
Infertility evaluation: Most laboratories require samples to be collected on-site as the semen needs to be examined within 60 minutes after ejaculation in order to maintain the quality of the specimen.
Semen is collected in a private area by self-stimulation. Some men, for religious or other reasons, might want to collect semen during the act of intercourse, using a condom. If this is the case, the healthcare practitioner should provide the condom or sheath because lubricated condoms can affect test results.
Sperm are very temperature-sensitive. If collection is done at home, the sample should be kept at body temperature (98.6oF/37oC) by keeping it next to the body during transportation. It should not be left at room temperature for an extended period of time and should not be refrigerated.
Sperm motility decreases after ejaculation; thus, timing and temperature are critical to obtaining accurate results. If the sample is poor, repeat testing might be needed.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For infertility testing: To give sperm a chance to replenish, abstain from ejaculating for 2 to 5 days before the sample is collected. Longer periods of abstinence may result in a greater volume of semen but decreased sperm motility. You may also be asked to avoid alcohol consumption for a few days before the test as well. Follow any instructions that are provided.
Post-vasectomy: Men may be advised to have regular ejaculations every 3-4 days to clear sperm from the reproductive tract more quickly.

When you think you might have a fertility problem or about three months after you have had a vasectomy


","



A semen analysis is performed when a healthcare practitioner thinks that a man or couple might have a fertility problem. Infertility is typically diagnosed when a couple has tried to get pregnant for 12 months without success.
A semen analysis to determine fertility should be performed on a minimum of two samples collected within 2 to 3 week intervals. Sperm count and semen consistency can vary from day to day, and some conditions can temporarily affect sperm motility and numbers.
When a semen analysis shows abnormal findings, the test is repeated at intervals as determined by the healthcare practitioner.
A shorter version of a semen analysis, a sperm check, is typically ordered about 3 months following a vasectomy to confirm success of the procedure and may be repeated as necessary until sperm are no longer present in the semen sample.



","



Post-vasectomy sperm check: Couples may discontinue using other methods of contraception when there are no sperm or rare non-motile sperm seen in the semen. If sperm are present in the semen, the man and his partner will have to take precautions to avoid pregnancy. Testing may be repeated until sperm are no longer present in his sample(s).
Infertility testing: In an evaluation of a man's fertility, each aspect of the semen analysis is considered, as well as the findings as a whole. Semen from a man can vary widely from sample to sample. Abnormal results on one sample may not indicate a cause of infertility, and multiple samples may need to be tested before a diagnosis is made.

Volume—the typical volume of semen collected is between 1.5 and 5 milliliters (about a teaspoon) of fluid per ejaculation. Decreased volume of semen would indicate fewer sperm, which diminishes opportunities for successful fertilization and subsequent pregnancy. Excessive seminal fluid may dilute the concentration of sperm.
Viscosity—the semen should initially be thick and then liquefy within 15 to 20 minutes. If this does not occur, then it may impede sperm movement.
Sperm concentration (also called sperm count or sperm density)—this is measured in millions of sperm per milliliter of semen. Normal is at least 20 million or more sperm per milliliter, with a total ejaculate volume of 80 million or more sperm. Fewer sperm and/or a lower sperm concentration may impair fertility.
Motility—the percentage of moving sperm in a sample; it is graded based on speed and direction travelled. At least 50% should be motile one hour after ejaculation, moving forward in a straight line with good speed. The progression of the sperm is rated on a basis from zero (no motion) to 4, with 3-4 representing good motility. If less than half of the sperm are motile, a stain is used to identify the percentage of dead sperm. This is called a sperm viability test.
Morphology—the study of the size, shape, and appearance of the sperm cells; the analysis evaluates the structure of the sperm. More than 50% of those cells examined should be normal in size, shape, and length. The more abnormal sperm that are present, the greater the likelihood of infertility. Abnormal forms may include defective heads, midsections, tails, and immature forms. To see an image of a normal sperm, see the MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia page on sperm. 
Semen pH—should be between 7.2 and 7.8. A pH of 8.0 or higher may indicate an infection, while a pH less than 7.0 suggests contamination with urine or an obstruction in the ejaculatory ducts.
Fructose—concentration should be greater than 150 milligrams per deciliter of semen.
White blood cells—there should be fewer than 1 million white blood cells per milliliter.
Agglutination of sperm—this occurs when sperm stick together in a specific and consistent manner (head to head, tail to tail, etc.), suggesting the presence of antisperm antibodies. Clumping of sperm in a nonspecific manner may be due to bacterial infection or tissue contamination.




","



While abnormal results decrease the chances of fertilization, some couples with poor results on infertility tests may still conceive, with or without assistance, and those with apparently good results may experience difficulties.
Several factors can affect the sperm count or other semen analysis values, including use of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, many recreational and prescription drugs (e.g., cimetidine), and some herbal medicines such as St. John's Wort.



","



A semen analysis is used to determine whether a man might be infertile—unable to get a woman pregnant. The semen analysis consists of a series of tests that evaluate the quality and quantity of the sperm as well as the semen, the fluid that contains them. The test may be used, in conjunction with other infertility tests, to help determine the cause of a couple's inability to get pregnant (conceive) and to help guide decisions about infertility treatment.
The semen analysis also can be used to determine whether sperm are present in semen after a man has had a vasectomy, a surgical procedure that prevents sperm from being released within the ejaculate. This surgery is considered a permanent method of birth control (99.9%) when performed successfully.

You may be instructed to avoid certain foods and medications prior to this test. (For more details, see the ""What is being tested?"" section.)


","

To help diagnose a carcinoid tumor that produces serotonin


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Serotonin is a chemical substance that transmits messages between nerve cells. This test measures the amount of serotonin in the blood.
Serotonin is a chemical derived from the amino acid tryptophan. It is produced as needed by the nervous system, mainly the brain, but also by special cells in the bronchial tubes (lungs) and gastrointestinal tract. More than 90% of serotonin in the blood is found in the platelets.
Serotonin helps transmit nerve impulses and constrict blood vessels, is a participant in the wake-sleep cycle, and affects mood. Serotonin is metabolized by the liver and its metabolites, primarily 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid), are eliminated in the urine.
Normally, serotonin is present in small amounts in the blood. Large quantities of serotonin and 5-HIAA may be produced continuously or intermittently by some carcinoid tumors. Carcinoid tumors are slow-growing masses that can form in the gastrointestinal tract (especially in the appendix) and in the lungs, although they may affect other organs as well. They are one of several types of tumors that arise from cells in the neuroendocrine system. These cells, which secrete hormones in response to signals from the nervous system, are found in organs throughout the body. The serotonin produced by carcinoid tumors may cause flushing of the face, diarrhea, a rapid heart rate, and wheezing, especially when the tumor has spread to the liver. This group of signs and symptoms is referred to as the carcinoid syndrome.
According to the American Cancer Society, there are about 8,000 gastrointestinal and between 2,000 and 4,500 lung carcinoid tumors diagnosed each year in the United States. Many more of these tumors may exist, but most remain small and do not cause any symptoms. When carcinoid tumors are discovered in asymptomatic patients during surgical procedures performed for other reasons, they are called ""incidental"" tumors. A small percentage of these tumors may eventually grow large enough to cause obstructions in the intestines or bronchial tubes of the lungs.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Test preparation is important for accurate serotonin test results. Foods rich in serotonin such as avocados, bananas, pineapples, plums, cantaloupes, grapefruits, plantains, melons, kiwi fruits, walnuts, hickory nuts, butternuts, pecans, tomatoes, and eggplants can interfere with serotonin measurement and should be avoided for 3 days prior to and during sample collection.
There are also a variety of drugs that can affect the metabolism of serotonin and the test itself. It is important that you talk to your healthcare provider before decreasing or discontinuing any medications.
Some laboratories request for overnight fasting prior to collection of blood samples.

When you have symptoms suggestive of a carcinoid tumor, such as flushing, diarrhea, and/or wheezing


","



This test is primarily ordered when you have symptoms suggestive of a carcinoid tumor.
Some signs and symptoms include:

Flushing of the face and neck (appearance of deep red color, usually with sudden onset)
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
Rapid heart rate
Wheezing, coughing, difficulty breathing

This test may be ordered initially or as a follow-up test when 5-HIAA test results are normal or near normal.



","



A significantly increased level of serotonin in a person with carcinoid syndrome symptoms is suggestive but not diagnostic of a carcinoid tumor. In order to diagnose the condition, the tumor itself must be located, biopsied, and examined by a pathologist. The healthcare practitioner will frequently follow up an abnormal test result with an order for an imaging scan to help locate any tumor(s) that may be present.
You may still have a carcinoid tumor even if the concentrations of serotonin and 5-HIAA are normal. Some carcinoid tumors do not produce serotonin or only produce it intermittently.
If you have no symptoms and normal levels of serotonin and 5-HIAA, it is unlikely to have a serotonin-secreting carcinoid tumor.



","



Serotonin concentrations may be slightly increased in people with intestinal obstruction, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), cystic fibrosis, and dumping syndrome. The serotonin test is not usually ordered with these conditions.



","



A serotonin test may be used to help diagnose carcinoid tumors. It may be ordered along with, or following, a 24-hour urine 5-HIAA test.
The serotonin test is not generally used as a monitoring tool to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or to detect recurrence of a carcinoid tumor. Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA may be used for this purpose.

To help detect, diagnose, and monitor plasma cell disorders (dyscrasias) such as multiple myeloma, primary amyloidosis, and related diseases or to monitor the effectiveness of treatment


","

","



Light chains are proteins produced by immune cells called plasma cells. Also called kappa and lambda light chains, they link together with other proteins (heavy chains) to form immunoglobulins (also known as antibodies) that target and neutralize specific threats to the body such as bacteria and viruses. Plasma cells normally produce some excess light chains that do not combine with heavy chains and instead enter the bloodstream. Free light chains (FLC) or serum free light chains (SFLC) refer to those that are not part of whole (intact) immunoglobulins and are present in the blood. This test measures the amount of free kappa and lambda light chains in the blood and calculates a kappa/lambda ratio to help detect, diagnose, and monitor conditions associated with an increased production of free light chains.
Each type of immunoglobulin is composed of four protein chains: two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. A particular plasma cell will produce only one type of immunoglobulin. Normally, there is a slight excess of free light chains produced, so low levels of free kappa and lambda chains are detected in the blood.
With a group of conditions called plasma cell disorders (dyscrasias) or monoclonal gammopathies, a plasma cell becomes neoplastic, dividing more than it should and producing a large number of copies (clones) of itself that crowd out other cells in the bone marrow. Since the clones come from a single plasma cell, they may produce large amounts of the same type of abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein). This may be an intact immunoglobulin, only a light chain, or rarely only a heavy chain.
Excess light chain production may be seen with any of the plasma cell disorders, such as multiple myeloma, MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, a condition that may progress to multiple myeloma), monoclonal light chain (primary) amyloidosis, and others. These conditions may go unnoticed or may progress to produce various signs and symptoms characteristic of the different diseases.

When you have bone pain, fractures, anemia (with normal size and shape red blood cells (normocytic)), kidney disease, and recurrent infections that your healthcare practitioner suspects are due to a plasma cell disorder; when you are being treated for a plasma cell disorder


","



Serum free light chain testing and a kappa/lambda ratio is ordered along with a protein electrophoresis test when someone has signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner suspects are related to a plasma cell disorder. These signs and symptoms will vary from person to person and tend to worsen over time. They involve various parts of the body and may include:

Bones—bone pain, soft spots, and fractures due to proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow
Blood—anemia (myelophthisic) and frequent infections due to low levels of normal red and white blood cells; plasma cells crowd out the other types of cells in the bone marrow, leading to a decrease of RBCs and WBCs.
Kidneys—production of abnormal amounts of light chains can lead to increased light chains in the urine (Bence-Jones protein); these proteins can cause kidney damage.

A healthcare practitioner may also order this test when someone has signs and symptoms associated with primary amyloidosis. Amyloidosis develops when abnormal proteins build up in organs or tissue, particularly the heart, liver, kidneys, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, and nervous system. In primary amyloidosis, the proteins are free light chains.
Various other clinical presentations can provide diagnostic clues that a plasma cell disorder may be present. Depending on the plasma cell disorder and which organs are affected, the person may have a variety of symptoms, such as:

Bone aches
Weakness, fatigue
Numbness, weakness or tingling of the arms and legs
Swelling of ankles and legs
Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing
Irregular heartbeat
Easy bruising
Purple patches around the eyes (so-called raccoon's eyes)
Tongue swelling

When a plasma cell disorder is diagnosed, the test may be ordered periodically to monitor the condition and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment.



","



This test must be interpreted in conjunction with other laboratory and clinical findings. A slightly abnormal result does not prove that someone has a plasma cell disorder. Conversely, someone may have a plasma cell disorder despite a normal result from this test. If a person has a plasma cell disorder, the result of this test won't indicate what specific plasma cell disorder is present.
Results of a serum free light chain test will often be evaluated in conjunction with the results of a protein electrophoresis test.
Free light chains will normally be present in the blood at low levels, with a kappa/lambda ratio of approximately 0.26 to 1.65 for individuals with normal kidney function.
Increased kappa free light chains and an increased kappa/lambda ratio may be seen with plasma cell disorders that produce excess monoclonal kappa light chains. Increased lambda free light chains and a decreased kappa/lambda ratio may be seen with plasma cell disorders that produce excess monoclonal lambda light chains.
In the context of MGUS or myeloma, significantly increased free light chain production and a markedly abnormal kappa/lambda ratio indicate an increased risk of disease progression.
When the test is used to monitor a known plasma cell disorder, a decrease in the quantity of excess light chain and a more normal kappa/lambda ratio may indicate a response to treatment.
Increased free light chains and/or an abnormal serum free kappa/lambda ratio may be seen with people who have some degree of kidney dysfunction that is unrelated to a plasma cell disorder. Decreased free light chains with a normal kappa/lambda ratio may be seen with a disorder that suppresses bone marrow cell production.
With suspected primary amyloidosis, an increase in serum free light chains with an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio may suggest that amyloidosis is the cause of symptoms. However, a biopsy of affected tissue establishes the diagnosis.



","



Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is the most common plasma cell disorder and it usually does not cause symptoms. A minority of people with MGUS will later develop multiple myeloma. This risk is increased in those with increased free light chain production and an abnormal kappa/lambda ratio.
Serum free light chains can also be increased, usually with a normal kappa/lambda ratio, with some connective tissue disorders, inflammatory conditions, neurological conditions, and some cancers but are not typically monitored in people with these conditions.
Serum free light chain analysis accelerates the detection of treatment response because the free light chains have a much shorter half-life (3-5 hours) than intact immunoglobulins (about 21 days). Although it is traditionally used for light chain-only plasma cell disorders, the test is also used for assessing response and minimal residual disease in myelomas that produce intact immunoglobulins.
If someone has this testing done at more than one laboratory, the results may not be interchangeable if the laboratories use different testing methods. If you are having a series of SFLC tests done, it is advised that you have the tests done by the same method, typically by the same laboratory, so that the results can be compared and interpreted correctly. You may wish to discuss this issue with your healthcare practitioner.

Serum free light chain (SFLC) testing is ordered to help detect, diagnose, and monitor plasma cell disorders (dyscrasias), including multiple myeloma, primary amyloidosis, and related diseases or to monitor the effectiveness of treatment.
Light chains are proteins produced by plasma cells. Within a plasma cell, two light chains and two heavy chains combine to form an immunoglobulin.
With a group of conditions called plasma cell disorders or monoclonal gammopathies, a plasma cell becomes neoplastic, dividing more than it should, and produces large amounts of an abnormal monoclonal immunoglobulin (M-protein). This protein may be an intact immunoglobulin or only one of its components – a kappa or lambda light chain, or rarely, a heavy chain.
Plasma cell disorders are routinely diagnosed using serum and urine protein electrophoresis tests (SPEP/UPEP), followed by immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) tests to determine which immunoglobulin is present in excess. Blood tests may also be ordered to measure levels of intact immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG, IgM, IgA).
Serum free light chain testing provides complementary information. It can detect the excessive free light chains that may be produced by neoplastic plasma cells and changes in the ratio of kappa and lambda production, which indicate an excess of these clonal plasma cells.
Initially, serum free light chain testing is ordered along with a serum protein electrophoresis test to detect abnormal monoclonal protein (M-protein) production and to calculate a kappa/lambda free light chain ratio. If the protein electrophoresis test is abnormal, then an immunofixation electrophoresis test is performed to determine which immunoglobulin is present in excess. If a plasma cell disorder is detected, then the free light chain test may be ordered periodically to monitor the condition or to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment. This test is particularly useful for diagnosing and monitoring select patients who have a less common oligosecretory myeloma, non-secretory myeloma, or light chain-only multiple myeloma.

sex-hormone-binding-globulin-shbg,"['SHBG', 'Testosterone-estrogen Binding Globulin', 'TeBG']","

None; however, testosterone is best measured in the morning because in men, testosterone levels demonstrate diurnal variation with higher levels in the morning.


","

Most commonly measured in the evaluation of low testosterone (possible androgen deficiency) in men; also commonly used in the evaluation of women with signs and symptoms suggestive of excess male hormones (androgens)


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is a protein produced by the liver that transports the hormones testosterone (an androgen), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (an androgen), and estradiol (an estrogen) in the blood as biologically inactive forms. Changes in SHBG levels can affect the amount of hormone that is available to be used by the body's tissues. This test measures the level of SHBG in the blood and is most often used to help evaluate patients for testosterone deficiency or excess.
In men, about 45% to 65% of testosterone in blood is normally bound to SHBG, with the remainder weakly and reversibly bound to albumin (the main protein in the blood). Only about 2% to 3% of testosterone is immediately available to the tissues as free testosterone, but testosterone that is weakly bound to albumin is also bioavailable and can be readily taken up by the body's tissues.
Slightly more testosterone is bound to SHBG in the blood (66% to 78%) in women than in men. In women, SHBG plays an integral role in regulating the levels of bioavailable male sex hormones (androgens) and estrogens circulating throughout the body. SHBG has a higher affinity for the androgens testosterone and DHT and so in the setting of low SHBG, women may have signs and symptoms related to androgen excess.
A total testosterone test does not distinguish between bound and unbound testosterone but determines the overall level of testosterone in the plasma. In many cases, this test is sufficient to evaluate patients for excess or deficient testosterone production. However, if your SHBG level is not normal, then the total testosterone may not be an accurate representation of the amount of testosterone that is available to your tissues. An SHBG test may be performed when your signs and symptoms do not correlate with the results of a total testosterone test.

","

When you have signs and symptoms of increased or decreased testosterone and the total testosterone measurement is inconsistent with your symptoms


","



Currently, the SHBG test is not performed frequently or routinely. SHBG is ordered primarily when the total testosterone results do not seem to be consistent with clinical signs and symptoms, such as infertility, decreased sex drive, and erectile dysfunction in men or infertility, irregular menstrual periods, and excess facial and body hair in women.



","



A high SHBG level means that it is likely that less free testosterone is available to your tissues than is indicated by the total testosterone test. A low SHBG level means that more of the total testosterone is bioavailable and not bound to SHBG. This information may be important in your overall evaluation when you have signs and symptoms of a condition related to excess or deficient sex hormone production.
Increased SHBG levels may be seen in:

Liver disease
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)
Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa)
Estrogen use (hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives)
Decreased sex hormone production in men (hypogonadism)
Pregnancy


Decreases in SHBG are seen with:

Obesity, type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Androgen (""anabolic steroid"") use
Cushing syndrome or excessive use of glucocorticoids (such as prednisone or dexamethasone)




","



SHBG concentrations are normally high in children of both sexes. After puberty, SHBG levels decrease more rapidly in males than in females. Levels are normally stable in adults and then begin to increase in the elderly male at the same time that total testosterone levels begin to decrease. In postmenopausal women, SHBG, testosterone, and estrogen concentrations decrease as hormone production by the ovaries tapers off.



",,"



The sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) test may be used to help evaluate men for low testosterone and women for excess testosterone production. It may be ordered in conjunction with other tests to evaluate the status of a person's sex hormones.
SHBG in men
SHBG and total testosterone levels may be ordered for an adult male to help determine the cause of infertility, a decreased sex drive, or erectile dysfunction. Measurement of SHBG in addition to testosterone is especially helpful when total testosterone results are inconsistent with clinical signs.
Measurement of total testosterone in the blood does not distinguish between bound and unbound (bioavailable) testosterone but, as the name implies, determines the overall quantity of testosterone in the blood. In many cases, this is sufficient to evaluate patients for the possibility of excess or deficient testosterone production. However, if a person's SHBG level is not normal, then the total testosterone may not be an accurate representation of the amount of testosterone that is available to the body's tissues.
Increased SHBG in men may be associated with symptoms of low testosterone levels (hypogonadism) because less testosterone is available to the body's tissues. Low testosterone leads to increased production of SHBG, further decreasing the amount of testosterone available to tissues.
The Endocrine Society professional guidelines recommend measuring total testosterone in the initial screen for testosterone deficiency in men. If abnormal, the test is repeated on another day. If repeat results are low-normal and/or if SHBG is abnormal, one of the following is recommended:

Measure bioavailable testosterone (using ammonium sulfate precipitation of SHBG)
Calculate free testosterone from total testosterone and SHBG
Measure free testosterone (using a method called equilibrium dialysis)


SHBG in women
In women, small amounts of testosterone are produced by the ovaries and the adrenal glands. Even slight increases in testosterone production can disrupt the balance of hormones and cause symptoms such as irregular or missed menstrual periods, infertility, acne, and excess facial and body hair (hirsutism). These signs and symptoms and others are often seen with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition characterized by an excess production of male sex hormones (androgens). SHBG and testosterone testing may be useful in helping to detect and evaluate excess testosterone production and/or decreased SHBG concentrations and in evaluating women suspected of having PCOS.

To determine if your gastrointestinal symptoms are due to an infection caused by Escherichia coli bacteria that produce Shiga toxin

A fresh liquid or unformed stool sample that does not contain urine or water, collected in a clean dry container; a rectal swab may be collected from infants. The stool or rectal swab may be placed in transport media for delivery to the laboratory.

Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria commonly occur in nature and are a necessary component of the digestive process. Most strains of E. coli are harmless, but disease-causing (pathogenic) E. coli can cause inflammation of the stomach and intestines (gastroenteritis). Laboratory tests can detect the presence of pathogenic E. coli that produce Shiga toxins.
Multiple subtypes of E. coli cause diarrheal illness, and they are classified by how they cause the disease. For example, some invade the lining of the intestines, causing inflammation, while others produce toxins.
E. coli that produce poisons called Shiga toxins are generally the only type of E. coli that are tested for in clinical settings from stool specimens. The Shiga toxins associated with these infections are so called because they are related to the toxins produced by another type of disease-causing bacteria, Shigella. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) may also be called verocytotoxic E. coli (VTEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).
A strain of STEC called O157:H7 is the STEC strain responsible for most gastrointestinal illness outbreaks in the U.S. However, non-O157 strains of STEC are gaining recognition, in part due to increased testing for them by clinical laboratories. For example, a 2011 outbreak of E. coli O104:H4, a non-O157 STEC, was associated with travel to Germany and resulted in 32 deaths related to contaminated sprouts. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, STEC O157 causes about 36% of STEC infections in the U.S., while non-O157 STEC cause the rest.
Outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of contaminated food, including undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized juice, unpasteurized milk, and raw produce such as leafy greens and alfalfa sprouts. STEC may also be transmitted through contaminated water, contact with farm animals or their environment, and from person to person. Even ingesting small numbers of E. coli can cause an infection.
In addition to symptoms of nausea, severe abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, fatigue, or possible vomiting and low-grade fever, STEC infections are often associated with bloody stools and, less commonly, can lead to serious complications, specifically hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is a result of the toxin entering the blood and destroying red blood cells (hemolysis). It can lead to kidney failure (uremia or the build up of nitrogen wastes in the blood) and can be life-threatening. Signs and symptoms include decreased frequency of urination (evidence of uremia), fatigue, and pale skin due to hemolytic anemia. HUS usually develops about a week after the onset of diarrhea.
About 5-10% of people who are diagnosed with an O157 STEC infection develop HUS. Children, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems are at greatest risk. However, most healthy persons recover from a STEC infection within a week and do not develop HUS. Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli can cause the same symptoms and complications and likely account for 20-50% of STEC infections in the U.S. annually. Different testing techniques are required to identify O157 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A fresh liquid or unformed stool sample is collected in a clean, dry container. The stool sample should not be contaminated with urine or water. Once it has been collected, the stool should be taken to the laboratory immediately or refrigerated and taken to the lab as soon as possible. Some laboratories provide transport media to support the survival of the organism from the time of collection until delivery to the laboratory. STEC becomes difficult to detect in the stool after one week of illness, so the timing of sample collection relative to the onset of illness is important.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have acute diarrhea that is persistent, severe and/or bloody

These tests may be ordered when a person has diarrhea and the healthcare practitioner suspects an infection of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli.
Some signs and symptoms include:

Diarrhea that is severe or acute and persists for more than a few days
Bloody stool
Fever
Severe abdominal pain, cramping and/or bloating

These tests are often ordered when a community-wide E. coli outbreak is suspected, for example, when several people who have eaten the same food from the same source have similar signs and symptoms.



","



Stool culture
Stool culture results are frequently reported out with the name of the pathogenic bacteria that was detected. If Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is detected (positive culture), it means STEC is the cause of the person's symptoms.
A negative stool culture for STEC means that Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not present or was not present in sufficient numbers to be detected. The culture results may indicate that a pathogen other than E. coli is causing the symptoms. These could include the bacterial pathogens Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter, viral pathogens, or parasites.
Toxin test by EIA
A negative result for enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Shiga toxin suggests that the toxin is not present.
A positive result for enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for Shiga toxins suggests that the toxins are present in the stool and that further testing should be done to grow and identify the E. coli producing the toxins.
Genetic tests
A negative result for a genetic test suggests that STEC was not present. A positive result suggests that STEC was present.



","



Non-pathogenic E. coli are a normal part of a healthy human digestive system. However, E. coli infections in parts of the body other than the gastrointestinal system can cause illness. E. coli is responsible for the majority of urinary tract infections and can also cause neonatal meningitis, among other infections. These E.coli infections are detected by culturing a sample from the infected area.



",,"



These tests are used to detect the presence of Escherichia coli (E. coli) that produce Shiga toxin and to help diagnose an infection of the digestive tract due to these bacteria. E. coli bacteria are part of healthy digestive systems in humans and other mammals, but there are strains of E. coli that produce poisons, called Shiga toxins. In addition to severe diarrhea, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious illness that may lead to kidney failure and even death if not treated properly. Tests for STEC are used to make an accurate diagnosis and help guide treatment.
These tests may also be used to help recognize and track suspected outbreaks of STEC. Infections are often linked to the consumption of contaminated food or water, contact with farm animals or their environment, or person-to-person contact. E. coli O157:H7 is the strain that is most common in foodborne E. coli outbreaks in the U.S. However, there are non-O157 strains of STEC that can also cause severe diarrhea and HUS, such as E. coli O104:H4.
It is important that STEC infections be diagnosed quickly to prevent the bacteria from spreading throughout the community and so that interventions can be made, if necessary, to prevent HUS. Tests for STEC include:

Stool culture: Cultures of stool samples use special nutrient media that selectively allow pathogens to grow while inhibiting growth of bacteria that are normally present in the digestive tract (normal flora). Once a pathogen grows in culture, other tests are performed to identify it. A stool sample may also be cultured for other pathogens, such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. O157:H7 STEC can be distinguished from other pathogens, including other types of E. coli, in culture because the bacteria have a distinct appearance when they are grown on a specific culture medium. Non-O157 STEC cannot be detected with the standard stool culture; they require special testing. Detection of non-O157 STEC is not usually performed at clinical laboratories but may be performed at public health laboratories. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that a culture for STEC be performed on all stools submitted for culture from people with acute, community-acquired diarrhea. Community-acquired diarrhea is in contrast to diarrhea acquired in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital.
Toxin test: This test is used to detect the Shiga toxin directly using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Stool cultures detect O157 STEC but do not detect non-O157 STEC. Therefore, the CDC recommends that EIA to detect Shiga toxins be used in conjunction with stool cultures. Detection of non-O157 STEC is important as it likely accounts for 20-50% of U.S. STEC infections annually. Enzyme immunoassay only identifies the presence of Shiga toxins and does not determine which strain of E. coli is producing the toxin.
Genetic tests: PCR for Shiga toxin 1 gene (stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 gene (stx2) are rapid molecular tests that can be used to confirm the presence of Shiga toxin.
Pulsed-field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE): This method is used by public health laboratories to identify subtypes of E. coli that are suspected in an outbreak. It creates a DNA ""fingerprint"" of the bacteria detected that is entered into a national database to be compared to other fingerprints. If matches are made, it may indicate occurrences of disease caused by the same strain of bacteria. In this way, public health labs can quickly evaluate the cause of an outbreak even though the illnesses might occur in different geographic areas.

sickle-cell-tests,"['Hemoglobin S', 'Hb S', 'Hgb S']","

None; however, if this test is used for diagnosis, the sample should not be drawn after a recent blood transfusion.


","

To determine if you have sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or, for infants, by pricking a heel or finger


","



Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder that leads to the production of an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (Hb S or Hgb S). Sickle cell tests determine the presence and relative amount of hemoglobin S in a blood sample or detect mutations in the genes that produce hemoglobin to help diagnose sickle cell anemia and/or identify people with sickle cell trait.
Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that binds to oxygen in the lungs and carries it to tissues throughout the body. Typically, hemoglobin A (Hb A, adult hemoglobin) makes up most of the hemoglobin found in normal RBCs in adults, with small amounts of hemoglobin A2 and hemoglobin F. Before babies are born, they normally produce large amounts of hemoglobin F (Hb F, fetal hemoglobin), which is then replaced by Hb A as the predominant hemoglobin shortly after birth.
Sickle cell disease is an inherited condition, passed from parents to children. Inheriting mutations in the genes that code for the production of hemoglobin can lead to abnormal types of hemoglobin (variants), such as Hb S and hemoglobin C (Hb C). Hemoglobin Cis one of the more common hemoglobin variants and may cause no symptoms or mild illness.

Sickle cell disease and anemia—a person who inherits two abnormal gene copies (alleles), one of which is a Hb S gene, has sickle cell disease (i.e., a person who has one Hb S gene copy and one Hb C gene copy has sickle cell disease.) A person who inherits two Hb S gene copies (one from each parent; homozygous) has sickle cell anemia, the most common and serious for of sickle cell disease.
Sickle cell trait (carrier)—a person who inherits one normal hemoglobin gene copy from one parent and a Hb S gene copy from the other parent (heterozygous) has sickle cell trait and is a sickle cell carrier. Carriers generally don't experience signs and symptoms associate with sickle cell disease but can pass the mutation to their children.

Hb S can form crystals that change the shape of the RBC from a round disc to a characteristic sickle shape. This altered shape limits the RBC's ability to flow smoothly throughout the blood vessels in the body, limits the hemoglobin's ability to transport oxygen to tissues, and decreases RBC lifespan from 120 days to about 10-20 days. A person with sickle cell disease (homozygous for Hb S) can become severely anemic because the body cannot produce RBCs as fast as they are destroyed. The affected person can suffer painful episodes and a variety of complications when sickled cells become lodged in and obstruct small blood vessels (vaso-occlusion).

Routinely as part of newborn screening; if you are in a high risk group and were born before newborn screening was mandated and want to know if you have sickle cell disease or are carrying the sickle cell trait; when you have signs and symptoms of anemia or abnormal results from a complete blood count (CBC) and your healthcare practitioner suspects sickle cell disease or trait


","



Sickle cell tests are routinely ordered soon after birth to screen newborns for sickle cell anemia.
Testing may be done when those who were born before newborn screening was mandated want to know if they have sickle cell disease or are carrying the sickle cell trait, especially if they are in a high-risk group. In African Americans, sickle cell disease occurs in one out of every 365 births.
Carrier screening may be offered when a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy. If a woman is found to be a carrier for sickle cell, testing should be offered to her partner.  Sickle cell tests may also be ordered when a person has abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC) and blood smear and/or has signs and symptoms that suggest the presence of sickle cell anemia.
Examples of signs, symptoms and complications of sickle cell anemia include:

Pain due to sickle cell crisis—the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease are episodes of pain that can last for extended periods of time. The pain can occur throughout the body and often involves the bones, joints, lungs, and stomach.
Anemia—sickle cell disease is a hemolytic anemia, meaning that the abnormal, sickled RBCs break down (hemolyze) more quickly than normal red blood cells and cannot be replaced by the body as quickly as needed. This leads to a decreased number of RBCs and reduced ability of the RBCs to transport oxygen throughout the body.
Increased number and frequency of infections, especially pneumonia, which is the leading cause of death in children with sickle cell disease.
Coughing, chest pain, and fever suspected to be caused by a serious complication of sickle cell disease called acute chest syndrome.

To learn more about signs and symptoms, see the article on Sickle Cell Anemia.



","



Newborn screening
In newborns who carry the sickle cell gene copy, most of the hemoglobin is fetal hemoglobin F, but a small amount of hemoglobin S will also be present. If a newborn has sickle cell trait, there may be a small amount of hemoglobin A and hemoglobin S. A full diagnostic evaluation should be done following positive screening results.
Hemoglobin S solubility test and sodium metabisulfite screening
Some hemoglobin S will be present in those who carry one sickle cell gene (sickle cell trait) and much more will be present in those who have sickle cell disease.
Diagnostic testing
Adults with sickle cell trait will produce mostly normal hemoglobin A, while those with sickle cell disease (anemia) will produce mostly Hb S with no Hb A. People who have two gene copies for two different hemoglobin variants will usually produce varying amounts of both types. For example, they may produce both Hb S and Hb C but no Hb A.
Genetic testing 
If two copies of the Hb S gene mutation are detected, then the person has sickle cell disease. If the person has one gene that codes for Hb S and one normal gene, then the person has sickle cell trait. If the person has one Hb S copy and a Hb C or beta thalassemia mutation, then the person is likely to experience some symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. If the person has one Hb S gene copy and another, more rare hemoglobin variant, then the person may or may not have any symptoms or complications. See the article on Hemoglobin Abnormalities for more on this.
Some examples of results that may be seen with sickle cell testing are listed in the following table.



Results Seen
Condition
Genes


Slightly decreased Hb A; Moderate amount Hb S (about 40%)
Sickle cell trait
One gene copy for Hb S (heterozygous)


Majority Hb S; Increased Hb F (up to 10%); No Hb A
Sickle cell disease
Two gene copies for Hb S (homozygous)



 



","



Sickle cell anemia symptoms and the complications experienced will vary greatly from person to person, even within the same family.
Recent blood transfusions, typically within the last three months of the date of testing, may cause a false-negative test result with some of the tests (e.g., Hb S solubility tests) because transfusion of normal RBCs reduce the relative amount of hemoglobin S present in an affected person's system.
People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but those who exercise heavily, such as athletes and those who are exposed to dehydration or altitude extremes, may sometimes experience sickle cell anemia symptoms. Sickle cell carriers produce both Hb A and some Hb S. When they are subjected to significant stresses that reduce the amount of oxygen in the body, the RBCs that contain Hb S can sickle.



",,"



Sickle cell tests may be used to screen for or help diagnose sickle cell anemia (also called sickle cell disease) or to identify individuals who are genetic carriers and have sickle cell trait. Testing may be used for:

Newborn screening—All states require that newborns be screened for sickle cell anemia, as well as some other hemoglobin disorders.
Carrier screening—It is recommended that all pregnant women or those considering pregnancy receive information regarding carrier screening for hemoglobin disorders, including sickle cell disease. Carrier screening lets prospective parents know whether they each are carriers and are at risk of passing on two defective gene copies, one from each them, to any children who then would be affected by the disease.
General screening—to identify sickle cell trait in asymptomatic parents who have an affected child or in other family members of an individual who has sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. Screening may also be done for those who were not screened at birth because universal newborn testing was not yet implemented.
Diagnosis—to detect and/or identify sickle cell disease in those with a positive screening test or symptoms of unexplained anemia or abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC)
 

Several types of sickle cell tests are available and multiple tests may be required. The types of test used depend on the purpose of testing.

Hemoglobin S solubility test and sodium metabisulfite test— these tests may be used for screening individuals 6 months old or older. They are not diagnostic and are not used for newborn screening. The tests detect the presence of hemoglobin S but do not distinguish between sickle cell disease and trait.
Hemoglobinopathy (Hb) evaluation—several kinds of tests are available for evaluating the type and relative amounts of various normal and abnormal hemoglobins. These methods typically separate the different types of hemoglobin that are present so that they can be identified and measured. They may be used for screening, diagnosis and/or monitoring. Examples include:
	
Hemoglobin electrophoresis
Hemoglobin fractionation by HPLC
Isoelectric focusing
Mass spectrometry
Capillary zone
		In people diagnosed with sickle cell disease, these tests may be used to measure the relative amount of Hb S and follow it over the course of treatment. For example, testing may be done after a blood transfusion or erythrocytapheresis/red cell exchange to ensure that the hemoglobin S level has been reduced. In addition, treatment with the drug hydroxyurea should result in a decrease in Hb S and an increase in fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), and so these tests can be used to monitor how well someone is responding to therapy.



Genetic testing (DNA analysis)—this tests for mutations in the genes that produce hemoglobin components. It can determine whether someone has one or two gene copies (alleles) of the Hb S mutation or has two different mutations in hemoglobin genes (e.g., Hb S and Hb C). Genetic testing can be used for carrier testing and for diagnosis. For pregnant women, amniotic fluid may be tested at 14 to 16 weeks to provide a diagnosis.  It can also be performed earlier with chorionic villus sampling. Sometimes, testing may be done by analyzing cell-free fetal DNA in the mother’s blood. (To learn more about this type of test, see the article on Cell-Free Fetal DNA.)
	Occasionally, a specialized testing called DNA sequencing may be done to help identify less common hemoglobin disorders. (To learn more, read Common Question 4 below.)
Genetic counseling and education should be provided so that patients understand test results, implications of the results, and their risk of passing genetic disorders to any children.


Other tests that may be used to help evaluate someone who is suspected of having or who is known to have sickle cell trait or disease include:

Complete blood count (CBC)—among other things, the CBC indicates the number of red blood cells as well as the amount of hemoglobin and will evaluate the size and shape of the RBCs present. This test is used to detect anemia.
Blood smear (also called peripheral smear and manual differential)—a trained laboratorian looks at a thin, stained layer of blood on a slide under a microscope. The number and type of red blood cells are evaluated to see if they are normal. Sickle-shaped RBCs may be seen on the blood smear.
Iron studies—these tests measure different aspects of the body's iron storage and usage. They are ordered to help determine whether someone has an iron deficiency anemia or an excess amount of iron (iron overload). People with sickle cell anemia who receive multiple blood transfusions may experience iron overload.

sirolimus,['Rapamycin'],"

None; the sample is typically collected 12 hours after the last dose and immediately prior to the next dose, or as directed by your healthcare provider

To determine the level of sirolimus in the blood in order to establish a dosing regimen, maintain therapeutic levels, and detect toxic levels


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Sirolimus, also called rapamycin, is a drug that is used to suppress the immune system in people who have had kidney transplants. It is given in combination with other drugs to prevent rejection of transplanted kidneys. This test measures the amount of sirolimus in the blood.
Normally, a person's immune system recognizes a transplanted organ as foreign and begins to attack it. Sirolimus limits this response and helps to prevent organ rejection by inhibiting the activation and production of white blood cells called T-lymphocytes. It also inhibits antibody production.
Sirolimus is typically taken by mouth (orally) and, after ingestion, is absorbed from the digestive tract. The drug's concentration peaks in the blood in approximately two hours and then gradually declines. It is metabolized by the liver and in the gut and is eliminated from the body in the stool (more than 90%) and urine (less than 2%).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has currently approved sirolimus for use in people 13 years of age and older who have kidney transplants to prevent acute rejection. It appears to be less toxic to the kidneys than other options and can be given in conjunction with the other immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Studies to evaluate its use in other age groups and types of organ transplantation, such as liver or lung, are ongoing, but so far, no data have convinced the FDA that sirolimus is appropriate for children under 13. Like other immunosuppressant agents, sirolimus may cause side effects and adverse reactions and is associated with an increased risk of infection and the development of lymphoma and skin cancer.
The sirolimus level must be monitored over time with laboratory tests because the drug has a narrow therapeutic index, which is the range between minimal effective concentration and minimum toxic concentration. If the drug concentration is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, symptoms associated with toxicity may develop, such as low platelet, low white blood cell, and high triglyceride levels. The sirolimus blood test is usually measured as a ""trough"" level, with blood collection just prior to the next dose – at the drug's lowest concentration in the blood.
Typically, sirolimus is given with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Dosages must be tailored to the individual, and sirolimus and cyclosporine must both be monitored. Often, people will begin with an initial higher dose (loading dose) of sirolimus and then are tapered to a lower dose. In people considered at low risk for complications, cyclosporine may be decreased or stopped after 2-4 months and sirolimus concentrations will be increased.

As soon as sirolimus therapy begins and whenever dose is changed; frequently at first, then at regular intervals to monitor concentrations over time; whenever excess or deficient levels are suspected


","



Sirolimus is ordered frequently at the start of therapy when the drug concentration reaches an equilibrium (stead state) in the blood. Because of the long time that it takes to clear the drug from the body (its long half-life), the sirolimus concentration may take several days to settle at a steady state. Once dosages have been optimized for the individual and are well tolerated, then the frequency of sirolimus testing may be reduced.
The test may be performed whenever there is a change in dose, a change in other medications, or whenever the transplant recipient has symptoms that suggest side effects, toxicity, or organ rejection.
Even when taking sirolimus properly, some people may have side effects and experience complications, such as infections and slow healing. Other side effects include:

Constipation
Diarrhea
Fever
Headache
Hypertension
Increased levels of lipids in the blood
Sleeplessness (insomnia)
Nausea

If any of the above persists or becomes severe, the healthcare provider should be notified.
Additionally, some of the more dangerous signs and symptoms that warrant an immediate call to the healthcare practitioner include:

Cough, shortness of breath
Chest pain
Fast heart rate
Pale skin
Unusual bleeding or bruising
Swollen, red, cracked, scaly skin
Hives, rash, itching
Difficulty swallowing
Swelling of the face, throat, tongue, lips, eyes, hands, feet, ankles or lower legs
Hoarseness

Monitoring is necessary as long as the transplant recipient takes sirolimus.



","



A level that is higher than the established therapeutic range may cause symptoms associated with toxicity. An inappropriately low level may lead to rejection of the transplanted organ. Depending on the results, a healthcare practitioner may adjust the dose that the person is given.
If the person is also taking other immunosuppressants or medications, then that person should work closely with their healthcare provider and transplant team to ensure that there is no potential interactions between the medications.



","



Drugs or food that inhibit or accelerate the metabolism of sirolimus may affect blood levels. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about any drugs or supplements you are taking. Examples of drugs that can increase sirolimus blood levels include antifungal medications, clarithromycin, erythromycin, isoniazid, protease inhibitors, and quinidine. Examples of those that can decrease sirolimus levels include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin and nafcillin. Grapefruit juice and herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort should be avoided while taking sirolimus.
People taking sirolimus should not alter their dose or the time that they take their dose without consulting their healthcare provider. Sirolimus should be taken consistently with respect to meals. Women should not become pregnant while taking sirolimus. Those considering pregnancy should talk to their health practitioner about associated risks.
Sirolimus should not be used with certain drugs that weaken the immune system and increase risk of infection. These include voriconazole, natalizumab, and rituximab. People taking sirolimus should also talk to their healthcare provider before getting any vaccines.



",,"



The sirolimus test is used to monitor the level of the drug over time in kidney transplant recipients who are taking the drug to prevent organ rejection. This test measures the amount of drug in the blood to determine whether the concentration is within the therapeutic range and is below the toxic level. Treatment with sirolimus must be monitored because the range in which the drug is effective but not toxic is very narrow.
If someone takes both sirolimus and cyclosporine (or tacrolimus), then both drug levels will be monitored.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) are autoantibodies, proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize and attack its own actin, a protein found in smooth muscle and other tissues, especially the liver. This test detects and measures the amount (titer) of SMA (or antibody against actin) in the blood.
The production of smooth muscle or actin antibodies is strongly associated with autoimmune hepatitis. It may also sometimes be seen in other forms of liver disease, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), but usually at lower antibody titers.
Autoimmune hepatitis occurs when the immune system attacks the body's liver cells. It presents as an acute or chronic inflammation of the liver that is not due to another cause, such as a viral infection, exposure to a drug or toxin, a hereditary disorder, or alcohol abuse. It can lead to liver cirrhosis and, in some cases, to liver failure. Autoimmune hepatitis can affect anyone at any age, but about 80% of patients are women. In the United States, more than 70% of people with this disorder will have SMA or actin antibodies, either alone or along with antinuclear antibodies (ANA).
The majority of smooth muscle antibodies produced with autoimmune hepatitis is specifically directed against a protein called actin or F-actin. Testing is available for specific actin autoantibodies, but it is not available in every laboratory. Tests for actin antibodies detect more cases of autoimmune hepatitis but, in some studies, give more false-positive results than tests for smooth muscle antibodies.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.

When you have hepatitis that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to an autoimmune-related process


","



The SMA (or actin antibody), ANA, and rarely LKM1 tests are ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has autoimmune hepatitis. They are usually ordered when a person presents with symptoms such as fatigue and jaundice along with abnormal findings on routine liver tests such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or bilirubin.
These autoantibody tests may be ordered along with other testing when a healthcare practitioner is investigating liver disease and wants to distinguish between different causes of liver injury, including viral infections, drugs, alcohol abuse, toxins, genetic conditions, metabolic conditions, and autoimmune disorders.



","



A significant increase in the blood titer of SMA or actin antibody and/or ANA is usually due to autoimmune hepatitis type 1. A small increase in SMA or actin antibody may be present in up to 50% of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). The SMA autoantibody may also be found in other conditions, such as infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis C, and some cancers.
A negative SMA or actin antibody test and an increased titer of LKM1 may indicate autoimmune hepatitis type 2. Type 2 is uncommon in the United States.
If the SMA or actin antibody test and other antibody tests are negative, then symptoms and liver injury may be due to causes other than autoimmune hepatitis.



","



Titers of SMA may be lower in children and in those with compromised immune systems. The levels may vary over the course of the disease and are not closely related to the severity of autoimmune symptoms or to a person's prognosis.
The presence of SMA, F-actin antibodies, and ANA are highly suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis but not diagnostic. When significant concentrations of both are present and the healthcare practitioner suspects autoimmune hepatitis, then a liver biopsy may be performed to look for characteristic signs of damage and scarring in the liver tissue.

The smooth muscle (SMA) or actin antibody test is primarily ordered along with antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and liver kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM-1) antibodies to help diagnose autoimmune hepatitis and to differentiate between the two major types of autoimmune hepatitis, type 1 and type 2.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein; sometimes a random or 24-hour urine sample is collected.


","



Sodium is an electrolyte present in all body fluids and is vital to normal body function, including nerve and muscle function. This test measures the level of sodium in the blood and/or urine.
Electrolytes are minerals that carry a charge and exist in your body fluids. Sodium and other electrolytes such as potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate (or total CO2) help cells function normally and helps regulate the amount of fluid in the body. While sodium is present in all body fluids, it is found in the highest concentration in the blood and in the fluid outside of the body's cells. This extracellular sodium, as well as all body water, is regulated by the kidneys.
We get sodium in our diet, from table salt (sodium chloride or NaCl), and to some degree from most of the foods that we eat. Most people have an adequate intake of sodium. The body uses what it requires and the kidneys eliminate the rest in the urine. The body tries to keep the blood sodium within a very narrow range. It does this by:

Producing hormones that can increase (natriuretic peptides) or decrease (aldosterone) the amount of sodium eliminated in urine
Producing a hormone that prevents water losses (antidiuretic hormone, ADH, sometimes called vasopressin)
Controlling thirst; even a 1% increase in blood sodium will make a person thirsty and cause that person to drink water, returning the sodium level to normal.

When the level of sodium in the blood changes, the water content in the body also changes. These changes can be associated with too little fluid (dehydration) or with too much fluid (edema), often resulting in swelling in the legs.

Sodium testing may be ordered as part of an electrolyte panel or metabolic panel during a routine health exam or when you are being evaluated for an acute or chronic illness.
A blood sodium test may be ordered when have signs and symptoms of low sodium, such as:

Weakness, fatigue

Lethargy
In severe cases, coma

However, there may be no symptoms when the sodium level falls slowly. That is why sodium levels are often checked even if you have no specific symptoms.
Sodium blood testing may be ordered when have signs and symptoms of high sodium, such as:

Thirst
Dry mucous membranes (e.g., mouth, eyes)
Less frequent urination
Muscle twitching
Agitation
In severe cases (extremely high concentrations), restlessness, acting irrationally, coma or convulsions

Sodium and other electrolytes may be measured when monitoring treatment with intravenous (IV) fluids or when there is a possibility of developing dehydration.
Electrolyte panels and basic metabolic panels are also commonly ordered on a regular basis when monitoring treatment of certain conditions, including high blood pressure, heart failure, and liver and kidney disease.
A random or 24-hour urine sodium test may be ordered when a blood sodium test result is abnormal to help determine the cause of the imbalance or to monitor treatment.



","



Sodium levels are typically interpreted along with results from other tests done at the same time, such as the results of other electrolyte tests. Low and high sodium levels can be caused by various conditions and diseases.
Examples of conditions that can cause a low blood sodium (hyponatremia) include:

Losing too much sodium, most commonly from conditions such as diarrhea, vomiting, excessive sweating, use of diuretics, kidney disease or low levels of cortisol, aldosterone and sex hormones (Addison disease)
Drinking too much water as might occur during exercise
Excess fluid buildup in the body (edema) caused by heart failure, cirrhosis, and kidney diseases that cause protein loss (nephrotic syndrome)
Conditions that lead to too much anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), causing a person to keep too much water in the body; this can happen with several diseases, particularly those involving the brain and the lungs, many kinds of cancer, and with use of some drugs.

Examples of conditions that can cause a high blood sodium level (hypernatremia) include:

Dehydration, losing too much water without drinking enough water, is a common cause.
Cushing syndrome 
Diabetes insipidus, a condition caused by too little ADH
Rarely, too much salt in the diet

Sodium urine concentrations must be compared with sodium blood levels. The body normally eliminates excess sodium, so the concentration in the urine may be elevated because it is elevated in the blood. It may also be elevated in the urine when the body is losing too much sodium; in this case, the blood level would be normal to low. If blood sodium levels are low due to insufficient intake, then urine concentrations will also be low.

Decreased urine sodium levels may indicate dehydration, congestive heart failure, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome.
Increased urine sodium levels may indicate diuretic use or Addison disease.

Sodium levels are often evaluated in relation to other electrolytes and can be used to calculate a quantity termed anion gap. For details, read the article Electrolytes and Anion Gap.

A sodium blood test is used to detect an abnormal sodium level, including low sodium (hyponatremia) and high sodium (hypernatremia). It is often used as part of an electrolyte panel or basic metabolic panel for a routine health exam.
A blood sodium test may also be used to:

Help detect, evaluate, and monitor electrolyte imbalances and/or acid-base (pH) imbalances (acidosis or alkalosis)
Detect the cause and help monitor treatment in people with dehydration or excess fluid buildup (edema)
Help evaluate and monitor a variety of chronic or acute illnesses involving the brain, lungs, liver, heart, kidney, thyroid, or adrenal glands
Monitor people taking medications that can affect sodium levels, such as diuretics

Urine sodium levels may be tested if you have abnormal blood sodium levels to help determine whether an imbalance is due to, for example, consuming too much sodium or losing too much sodium. Urine sodium testing may also be used if you have abnormal kidney test results to help your healthcare practitioner determine the cause of kidney disease and to help guide treatment.
As the meals we eat on a given day affect our sodium levels, a 24-hour urine sodium tests can be helpful to your healthcare practitioner to reduce the impact of a single meal on the urine sodium result.

To monitor progression or recurrence of a rare cancer called mesothelioma that affects the membranes that surround the lungs, heart, and abdominal cavity; most cases of mesothelioma are associated with asbestos exposure.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRP) are breakdown products from proteins found in the membranes that line the cavities surrounding the lungs, heart, and abdomen. High amounts of SMRP are often seen in the blood of people suffering from mesothelioma, and the amount of SMRP in the blood is thought to be related to the extent of disease. This test measures the amount of SMRP in the blood. 
Malignant mesothelioma is a rare cancer of the membranes that cover the outside of internal organs and line body cavities, including the chest (pleural mesothelioma), abdominal cavity (peritoneal mesothelioma), and the heart (pericardial mesothelioma). About 3,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the U.S., and pleural mesothelioma is the most common type, accounting for 90% of all cases.
Malignant mesotheliomas can also be classified based on the type of cell found:

Epithelioid cell type (line body cavities): accounts for 50-70% of mesotheliomas; tends to be associated with a better prognosis than the other types.
Sarcomatoid cell type: accounts for about 10% of mesotheliomas and is the most difficult to treat.
Mixed (biphasic): has both epithelioid and sarcomatoid areas; accounts for up to 40% of mesotheliomas.

Most cases of pleural mesothelioma—about 70% to 80%—arise in people with a history of working with asbestos, especially in the shipbuilding, construction, automotive, and fireproofing industries. The disease has a long latency period, meaning that people usually develop mesothelioma 20 to 50 years after asbestos exposure.

","

After you have been diagnosed with mesothelioma, this test may be ordered anytime during or after treatment to follow response to treatment.


","



A healthcare practitioner might order a series of SMRP tests to monitor progression of mesothelioma or its recurrence:

After someone has been diagnosed
After surgery has been done to remove tumor tissue in the chest cavity
During and/or after chemotherapy or radiation therapy




","



If a series of SMRP tests show SMRP levels are increasing, it may indicate that mesothelioma has progressed. If the series of tests indicates that SMRP levels are decreasing, then the person may be responding to therapy. If the levels are unchanged, it may mean that the disease has stabilized.
The interpretation of SMRP test results will likely be done in conjunction with results from imaging studies. That is because:

People with other cancers —including lung, ovarian, endometrial, and pancreatic cancers—can have elevated test levels as a result of their cancers producing substances that interfere with the test.
Some people with epithelial mesothelioma, a form of the disease that affects the cavity lining or membranes, do not produce SMRP.




","



This test is not used to diagnose mesothelioma but only used to monitor progression or recurrence. The diagnosis of this disease is often difficult and involves many steps. It usually begins with a review of the person's medical history, including a history of exposure to asbestos, and with a complete physical examination. These may be followed by imaging studies of the chest and abdomen, including X-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans, and with pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Diagnosis may be confirmed by examining tissue from a biopsy or fluid from the affected area for malignant cells.
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has classified the test for SMRP in a special category, as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD), with a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE). The HDE is intended to make medical devices, like laboratory tests, available to those with rare diseases even though the device has not undergone the usual evaluation for effectiveness. To qualify for an HDE, the device must be intended for use in diseases that occur in fewer than 4,000 patients per year. These diseases are so rare that it is not cost effective for a manufacturer to do the extensive evaluation needed for FDA approval. The exemption makes a potentially useful device or test available to the small number of people who might benefit from it.
Nonetheless, manufacturers must show that an exempted device doesn't pose any threat of illness or injury and that its probable benefits outweigh any risks. However, since HDE tests have not been validated as effective, they are considered experimental. So, before a person can have an SMRP test performed, the healthcare provider must obtain the approval of an institutional review board (IRB), a committee charged with overseeing medical research involving humans and protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects. The manufacturer of the SMRP test has contracted with a national IRB to provide the review and oversight for this test. The healthcare provider will receive certification to use SMRP from that review board.

soluble-transferrin-receptor,"['sTfR', 'Transferrin Receptor', 'TfR', 'Serum Transferrin Receptors']","

","

To detect iron deficiency anemia and distinguish it from anemia caused by chronic illness or inflammation


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Soluble transferrin receptors are proteins found in blood that can be elevated with iron deficiency. This test measures the amount of soluble transferrin receptors to help detect and evaluate iron deficiency and aid in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia.
Iron is an essential nutrient absorbed from the diet. Transferrin is the main protein in the blood that binds to iron and carries it to tissues and cells throughout the body. About 80% of iron is transported to the bone marrow, where it is incorporated into the hemoglobin in red blood cells (RBCs), and the rest is mostly stored in other cells and tissues as ferritin and hemosiderin.
When transferrin binds to iron, they form a complex. These complexes bind to transferrin receptors found on the surface of cells and the iron is then transported into the cells. Transferrin receptors are cleaved from the surface of cells, enter the bloodstream, and become soluble transferrin receptors (sTfR).
The number of transferrin receptors found on the surface of cells correlates with the level of iron within cells. When the iron level drops, the cells produce more transferrin receptors. As more receptors are produced, more are cleaved from cell surfaces and enter the blood, increasing the level of soluble transferrin receptors. Thus, measuring the level of sTfR is one way of evaluating the amount of iron available in the body.
Red blood cells have a lifespan of about 120 days. Because of this, the bone marrow must continually produce new RBCs. If there is insufficient iron taken in through the diet and/or increased iron loss (e.g., bleeding), iron reserve stored in the body is decreased. Over time, this can lead to iron deficiency, as the amount of iron stored in the body exhausts and the demand for iron exceeds the supply. As a result, fewer RBCs are produced and those newly formed RBCs are also smaller (microcytic) and contain less hemoglobin (hypochromic). This is a condition called iron deficiency anemia.
Usually, a ferritin test is used to evaluate the amount of iron reserve in the body and to help diagnose iron deficiency anemia. However, the ferritin level can be elevated when an individual has inflammation or a chronic disease, such as autoimmune disorders or some cancers. In these conditions, the ferritin test is not useful as it may falsely indicate adequacy in iron reserve and therefore a test for soluble transferrin receptors may be ordered.

When iron deficiency anemia is suspected


","



The soluble transferrin receptor test is not routine but may be ordered along with or in follow up to other iron tests when you have a normal or near-normal ferritin level but iron deficiency is still suspected. It may be ordered as an alternative to ferritin when you have a chronic illness and/or inflammation is present or suspected.
 This test may be ordered when you have general signs and symptoms of anemia, such as:

Weakness, fatigue
Lack of energy
Paleness


Or when you have signs and symptoms more specific for iron deficiency anemia, such as:

Brittle or spoon-shaped nails
Swollen or sore tongue
Cracks or ulcers at the corners of the mouth
Difficulty in swallowing
Craving to eat unusual non-food substances such as ice or dirt (also known as ""pica"")


This test may also be ordered when a complete blood count (CBC) shows decreased hemoglobin and small red blood cells (low MCV).



","



The level of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) will be increased with iron deficiency. If you have anemia and your sTfR level is elevated, then it is likely that you have iron deficiency anemia. If your level is within the normal range, then it is more likely that the your anemia is due to another cause, such as chronic disease or inflammation.
If you are being treated for iron deficiency anemia, decreasing sTfR levels in a series of tests indicates an increase in iron reserve.
A low level of sTfR may be seen with hemochromatosis (a condition associated with iron overload) or protein malnutrition, but the test is not usually used to monitor these conditions.



","



African Americans may have moderately increased sTfR levels, as will people who live at higher elevations.
Birth control pills may affect the test results.
This testing may not be useful if you have an inherited disorder that affects hemoglobin production or function, such as thalassemia or sickle cell anemia. Test results may be elevated in people with red blood cell breakage (hemolysis) or recent blood loss and will not be accurate in those who have had a recent blood transfusion.
An elevated sTfR level is not as specific for iron deficiency as is, for example, a very low level of ferritin.



","



The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) test is primarily ordered to help distinguish between anemia that is caused by iron deficiency and anemia that is caused by inflammation or a chronic illness (so-called anemia of chronic disease or inflammation). It is not a routine test but may be ordered if other tests that evaluate the amount of iron in the body do not provide conclusive information.
Typically, a group of iron tests is ordered to evaluate iron availability if a person has anemia and/or if iron deficiency is suspected. These tests may include iron, transferrin, TIBC (total iron-binding capacity, which is either measured or calculated based on the level of transferrin), transferrin saturation (calculated based on levels of iron and TIBC), and ferritin.
Ferritin is usually the preferred test to evaluate stored iron, but it is an acute phase reactant, which means that it may be increased with inflammation or with chronic diseases such as autoimmune disorders, some cancers, and chronic infections. In these cases, ferritin may not be a good measure of stored iron. Since sTfR is not an acute phase reactant, it may be ordered as an alternative to ferritin if a chronic illness is present or suspected.

You may be instructed to rinse your mouth out with water prior to collection and to avoid food for 1-2 hours before the sample is collected.


","

To detect and identify the cause of bacterial pneumonia or some other lower respiratory tract infections; to monitor the efficacy of treatment


","

A sputum sample (deep respiratory secretions, not saliva), usually collected first thing in the morning; sometimes, depending on the infection, up to 3 sputum samples might be collected over consecutive days.


","



Sputum is the thick mucus or phlegm that is expelled from the lower respiratory tract (bronchi and lungs) through coughing; it is not saliva or spit. Care must be taken in the sample collection process to ensure that the sample is from the lower airways and not from the upper respiratory tract. Sputum samples may be expectorated or induced (See the section below on sample collection.)
Bacterial sputum cultures detect the presence of disease-causing bacteria (pathogens) in people who are suspected of having bacterial pneumonia or other lower respiratory tract infections. Bacteria in the sample are identified and susceptibility testing is performed to guide antibiotic treatment.
Sometimes a respiratory infection is caused by a pathogen that cannot be grown and identified with a routine bacterial sputum culture. Other tests, such as an AFB smear and culture, fungal culture, or viral culture, may be ordered in addition to or instead of a routine culture.
Typically, the first step in the routine analysis of a sputum sample is a Gram stain to identify the general type of bacteria that may be present. The sample is then placed on or in appropriate nutrient media and incubated. The media encourages the growth of bacteria that are present, allowing for further testing and identification.
Sputum is not sterile. That means that when a person has a bacterial respiratory infection, there will typically be harmless bacteria that are normally present in the mouth, throat, etc. (normal flora) as well as disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria present.
A trained laboratorian differentiates normal flora from pathogenic bacteria and identifies the various types of bacteria present in the culture. Identification is a step-by-step process that may involve several biochemical, immunological, and/or molecular tests and observations of the organism's growth characteristics.
Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is frequently required to guide the treatment and to determine whether the bacteria present are likely to respond to specific antibiotics.
The sputum culture, Gram stain(s), and susceptibility testing all contribute to a report that informs the health practitioner which pathogen(s) are present and which antibiotic therapies are likely to inhibit their growth. 
How is the sample collected for testing?
Sputum samples may be coughed up or induced. Samples that are coughed up are expelled into a sterile cup provided by the laboratory. Deep coughing is generally required, and the person should be informed that it is phlegm/mucus from the lungs that is necessary, not saliva. If someone cannot produce a sputum sample, then it can often be induced by following instructions provided and inhaling a sterile saline or glycerin aerosol for several minutes to loosen phlegm in the lungs. Steam inhalation or a hot shower can also be useful in loosening the phlegm. Sometimes, induction of sputum might be assisted by a respiratory therapist technician.
All samples collected should be taken to the laboratory promptly for processing while they are fresh. Sputum samples must be evaluated and accepted by the laboratory before they are processed.
Useful sputum culture results rely heavily on good sample collection. If examination of a Gram stain of the sample reveals that it contains a significant number of normal cells that line the mouth (squamous epithelial cells), then the sample is not generally considered adequate for culture and a re-collection of the sample may be required. If the sample contains a majority of white blood cells that indicate a body's response to an infection, then it is considered to be an adequate sample for culturing.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
You may be instructed to brush your teeth and rinse your mouth with water prior to sample collection. You may also be instructed to avoid food for at least 1-2 hours before the sample is collected, which is usually first thing in the morning.

A bacterial sputum culture is ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has a bacterial infection of the lungs or airways, such as bacterial pneumonia. This may show as changes in the lungs as seen on a chest x-ray. Signs and symptoms may include:

Cough
Fever, chills
Muscle aches
Fatigue
Trouble breathing
Chest pain
Confusion

Sometimes a sputum culture may be ordered after treatment of an infection, to verify its efficacy.



","



If pathogenic bacteria are detected in a person with signs and symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, then it is likely that the person's symptoms are due to a bacterial infection. A positive culture report typically identifies the pathogen that was detected.
The most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in adults in the U.S. is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). Other common bacteria include:

Staphylococcus aureus (staph)
Haemophilus influenzae
Moraxella catarrhalis
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes

A culture that is reported as ""no growth in 24 or 48 hours"" is usually considered negative. If pathogenic bacteria are not detected with a culture, then it may be that the person's symptoms are due to a viral infection, or that the pathogen was not present in sufficient quantity in the sample collected. It may also be due to the fact that the microorganism responsible is not detectable with a routine bacterial culture.
Examples of organisms NOT detected with a routine bacterial culture of the sputum include:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumonia—common in young adults
Legionella species
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tuberculosis; see AFB Testing)
Pneumocystis jiroveci—a fungus that can be seen in those who have had organ transplants or who have HIV/AIDS
Other fungi (see Fungal Tests)
Viruses
Rarely, a parasitic infection may also cause symptoms of a lower respiratory infection.




","



People whose lungs have become damaged through disease, exposure to toxins or chronic exposure to irritants, or from previous infections have an increased risk of recurrent infections.
With bacterial respiratory infections, the sputum may have a thick consistency (viscous), appear discolored – yellowish, greenish, grayish, or (rarely) rusty or bloody – and may have an unpleasant odor.



",,"



A bacterial sputum culture is used to detect and diagnose bacterial lower respiratory tract infections such as bacterial pneumonia or bronchitis. It is typically performed with a Gram stain to identify the bacteria causing a person's infection.
Sometimes lower respiratory tract infections are caused by pathogens that cannot be detected with routine bacterial sputum cultures. This is either because the pathogens require very specific nutrients to grow in culture or because they grow very slowly. When this is suspected to be the case, specialized tests may be done in addition to or instead of a routine culture to help identify the cause of infection. These additional tests include, for example, an AFB smear and culture to detect tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections, a fungal culture, or a Legionella culture.
A bacterial sputum culture may be ordered by itself, along with a complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate the type and number of white blood cells as an indication of infection, and/or along with a blood culture to test for septicemia.
Sputum is not sterile, so when a person has an infection, there will typically be both normal flora and pathogenic bacteria present. If pathogenic bacteria are identified during a sputum culture, then antimicrobial susceptibility testing is usually performed so that the appropriate antibiotics can be prescribed.

To determine whether you have an infection of your digestive tract due to the presence of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria


","

A fresh stool sample transported to the laboratory within 2 hours or one that has been placed in a transport medium (a collection vial containing a preservative)


","



The stool culture is a test that detects and identifies bacteria that cause infections of the lower digestive tract. The test distinguishes between the types of bacteria that cause disease (pathogenic) and the types that are normally found in the digestive tract (normal flora). The test helps to determine if pathogenic bacteria are the cause of a person's gastrointestinal symptoms (gastroenteritis).
The bacteria found in stool are representative of the bacteria that are present in the digestive system (gastrointestinal tract). Certain bacteria and fungi called normal flora inhabit everyone's gastrointestinal tract. They play an important role in the digestion of food and their presence keeps a check on the growth of disease-causing bacteria.
Sometimes, the balance of the normal flora may be affected by the administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics; the drugs inhibit the growth of normal flora and allow the bacteria Clostridium difficile that is resistant to the antibiotics to survive and overgrow the digestive tract, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. 
Pathogenic bacteria can enter and infect the digestive tract when someone eats food or drinks water that is contaminated. Examples of contaminated sources include raw or undercooked eggs, poultry or beef, unpasteurized milk, and untreated water from lakes, streams, and (occasionally) from community water supplies. (For more on this, see the article Food and Waterborne Illness.)
People who travel outside the U.S., especially to developing nations, may face a greater risk of being exposed to disease-causing bacteria. Some of these bacteria may be true pathogens while others are strains of gastrointestinal bacteria that are normal flora for the local inhabitants but cause gastrointestinal distress to the tourist. Visitors may become infected by eating or drinking anything that has been contaminated with the bacteria, even things as simple as tap water, ice cubes in a drink, a fresh salad, or food from a vendor's stall.
The most common symptoms of a pathogenic bacterial infection are prolonged diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, mucus in the stool, abdominal pain and cramping, and nausea. If diarrhea lasts more than a few days, it may lead to complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, which can be dangerous conditions, especially for children and the elderly. Dehydration can cause symptoms such as dry skin, fatigue, and light-headedness.
Severely affected people may require hospitalization to replace lost fluids and electrolytes. Hemolytic uremic syndrome is a serious complication characterized by the destruction of red blood cells and kidney failure that may occasionally arise from an infection with a toxin-producing strain of the bacteria Escherichia coli. The condition is most frequently seen in children, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems.
If a person's illness is uncomplicated and goes away within a few days, a healthcare practitioner may not order testing. However, if symptoms are severe, if there is bloody diarrhea or mucus present in the stool, or if it is continuing unabated, then a stool culture may be ordered. This is especially true if the person has been outside the U.S. and/or has eaten or drunk anything that has also made someone close to them ill.
To aid diagnosis, a stool culture may be done in conjunction with or following a GI pathogens panel that simultaneously tests for multiple disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Other tests that may be done include an ova and parasite exam or antigen tests to identify specific microbes.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A fresh stool sample is collected in a clean container. The stool sample should not be contaminated with urine or water. Once it has been collected, the stool should be taken to the laboratory within two hours after collection or should be transferred into a vial containing a preservative and taken to the lab as soon as possible. For infants, a stool sample is usually collected with a swab of the rectum.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you have diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea and/or vomiting that is severe or lasts more than a few days


","



A stool culture may be ordered when someone has signs and symptoms of an infection of the digestive tract, such as:

Diarrhea that lasts more than a few days and may contain blood and/or mucus
Abdominal pain and cramping
Nausea, vomiting
Fever

Not everyone who has these symptoms will necessarily have testing done or be treated. In people who have healthy immune systems, these infections often resolve with supportive care and without the use of antibiotics. A stool culture is more likely to be ordered when a person:

Has severe symptoms, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and/or other complications
Is very young, elderly, or has a weakened immune system; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), diarrhea is a global killer. It is the second leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 worldwide, killing an estimated 2,195 children a day.
Has prolonged signs and symptoms and/or infections that do not resolve without treatment
Has an illness during and following travel outside the U.S., especially to emerging nations; the CDC estimates that 30% to 70% of those who travel outside of the U.S. will get a GI infection.
Has eaten food or drunk fluids that may have been contaminated with pathogenic bacteria, such as undercooked meat or raw eggs, or the same food that has made others ill
Is ill and a possible foodborne or waterborne outbreak prompts the medical community to investigate and identify the cause; examples include contaminated produce, contaminated food from a specific restaurant, and/or illness on a cruise ship.

A healthcare practitioner may order one or more stool cultures when someone has had a previous pathogenic bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract and has either been treated for it or it has resolved on its own. This may be done to verify that the pathogenic bacteria are no longer detectable because in some cases people can become carriers of the bacteria. Carriers are not ill themselves, but they can infect other people.



","



If a stool culture is positive for pathogenic bacteria, then they are the most likely cause of the person's diarrhea and other symptoms. Results are frequently reported out with the name of the pathogenic bacteria that was detected.
Some of the most common pathogenic bacteria that cause infections in the U.S. and their most frequently encountered sources include:

Campylobacter – found in raw or undercooked poultry and unpasteurized milk; it is one of the most common causes of bacterial diarrhea in the U.S. It may become especially serious if it spreads to the blood, and it occasionally causes long-term complications such as arthritis and Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Salmonella – found in raw eggs (even intact disinfected eggs), raw poultry, uncooked vegetables, and in reptiles; pets such as lizards and turtles may carry salmonella in their intestines without being ill themselves. Some humans may become carriers of salmonella. Salmonella may be transmitted person-to-person.
Shigella – found in food and water contaminated with stool and from infected person-to-person when careful sanitation is not observed; for instance, it can be a challenge to prevent the spread of Shigella within a family and in a daycare or nursing home setting since very few organisms may cause disease.

A wide variety of other bacteria may sometimes cause GI infections and may be identified with a stool culture. Some important examples include:

Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and other toxin-producing E. coli (most strains of E. coli are considered normal flora and do not cause disease) – found in raw or undercooked hamburger/beef, spinach, or unpasteurized cider; causes bloody diarrhea and may lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Clostridium difficile – may be present as part of the normal flora, but use of broad-spectrum antibiotics can result in an overgrowth of these bacteria. Toxin-producing strains can cause diarrhea and other serious complications. If these strains are suspected to be the cause, then separate tests that detect the toxin-producing C. difficile will be performed.

Examples of other less common causes include:

Aeromonas
Plesiomonas
Yersinia enterocolitica
Vibrio cholerae and other Vibrio species

For more on bacteria that cause GI infections, see the articles on Diarrhea, Food and Waterborne Illness, and Travelers' Diseases.
Results of stool cultures that are reported as negative usually reflect the fact that the stool culture was checked for the most common pathogens at several intervals and none were found (not isolated). A report may state: ""no Campylobacter isolated,"" ""no Salmonella or Shigella isolated,"" etc.
If the culture is negative for the major pathogens, then it is likely that the person's signs and symptoms are due to another cause or to a less common pathogen. It is also possible that pathogenic bacteria are present in the gastrointestinal tract, but there were too few bacteria in that particular stool sample to be detected. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that this is the case and symptoms continue, a stool culture on another sample may be ordered and/or followed up with other tests.
Most diarrheal disease is caused by a single pathogen, but it is possible to have an infection with more than one.



","



Severe pathogenic bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract and those causing complications may be treated with antibiotics, but many uncomplicated cases are best left untreated. People with healthy immune systems will usually get better on their own within a week or so. They are instructed in how to prevent the spread of the infection and are treated and monitored for symptoms such as dehydration.
Pathogenic bacterial infections are monitored on a community and sometimes national level. Other than foreign travel-related cases, health officials try to determine where an infection came from so that they can address any potential public health concerns. Bacterial isolates causing foodborne illness are sent to the State Public Health Laboratories to be typed by molecular methods. The results of the typing are uploaded into a national database to detect common source outbreaks across the U.S. The typing helps to identify specific foods or food products that are the source of the infection.
Travelers' diarrhea is typically caused by toxin-producing Escherichia coli, which are the leading cause of bacterial diarrhea infections among travelers to Africa, Asia, and Latin America. These strains of E. coli, however, are different than the strains of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157:H7), which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome.

A stool culture is used to detect the presence of disease-causing (pathogenic) bacteria and help diagnose an infection of the digestive system (gastrointestinal, GI tract). Since there are many causes of GI infections, a stool culture may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as a GI pathogens panel or an ova and parasite exam (O&P) to help establish a diagnosis.
A GI pathogens panel is performed on a stool sample to simultaneously test for the viruses, bacteria, and parasites that are common causes of GI infections. These panels are relatively new and laboratories and healthcare practitioners are still determining how to utilize them to provide the optimum patient results while being cost-effective. A stool culture and an O&P may be done if a microbe is not identified by the panel and/or there is a suspicion of bacteria or parasites other than those included in the GI panel.
Many GI infections in the U.S. resolve with no specific treatment, with only supportive care, and may not require testing. In otherwise healthy individuals, the infections are considered common illnesses that are not serious and sometimes thought of as ""food poisoning"" or
""stomach flu."" However, there are cases where it is useful to perform testing that identifies the cause of the GI infection – to guide its treatment, eliminate its source, and limit its spread.
Laboratories typically use stool cultures to detect and identify the most common intestinal disease-causing bacteria:

Campylobacter species
Salmonella species
Shigella species

Some bacteria cause illness by producing toxins. These bacteria may be cultured, but many of the tests used to detect them are dedicated to the direct detection of their toxins, either by PCR or antigen test. Examples include:

Escherichia coli O157:H7
Clostridium difficile

Depending on the affected person's medical and/or travel history, tests for other pathogens or potential pathogens may be included or be separately available. Some of these include:

Aeromonas
Plesiomonas
Yersinia enterocolitica
Vibrio species

To screen for colon cancer


","

A stool sample is required. The sample may be collected in the privacy of your home. Typically, you will be supplied with a kit to collect an entire bowel movement and send it to a lab. Follow all the instructions that are provided with the kit to collect a stool sample that is not contaminated with urine. Follow the shipping instructions and timing because the samples must arrive at the testing laboratory within a specified time frame.

The stool DNA test, also called a stool DNA-fecal immunochemical test, is a combination test that detects specific changes (mutations) in several genes associated with colon cancer within the cells shed in stool, as well as trace amounts of blood in stool. These genetic changes and small amounts of blood may be the first and sometimes the only signs of precancerous growths (polyps) or early colon cancer, making this stool-based test a useful screening tool. Detecting precancerous polyps and/or colon cancer early increases the chances that they can be successfully treated.
By combining two types of tests, the stool DNA test increases the chance of detecting polyps and colon cancer. The stool DNA tests for:

DNA changes (mutations) associated with colon cancer—cancer is caused by changes in the DNA inside our cells. These changes can cause cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. The stool DNA test detects changes associated with colon cancer in the DNA of cells that are shed from the digestive tract into stool.
Trace amounts of blood (hidden or ""occult"" blood)—although there are several possible causes of blood in the stool, one important cause is the presence of polyps or cancer in the digestive tract. Colon polyps are common as people age, but most polyps do not cause any health problems and are benign. However, a benign polyp can turn into a cancerous polyp and the cancer may even spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Polyps are finger-like growths that protrude into the cavity (lumen) of the colon or the rectum. They can be fragile and bleed intermittently, such as when food waste brushes against them, leading to blood in the stool. This test uses a method called fecal immunochemical testing to detect trace amounts of blood (occult blood) in the stool. The fecal immunochemical test detects the globin (protein) part of hemoglobin in red blood cells. The test is specifically designed to detect globin from human blood and not from foods that you eat (e.g., meat). Therefore, dietary restrictions are not necessary before testing. Also, hemoglobin from bleeding in the upper digestive tract is broken down before it reaches the lower digestive tract and so upper GI bleeds are not usually detected by this test.

For people with average risk of colon cancer, the American Cancer Society recommends screening for colon cancer between the ages of 45 and 75, while the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend screening starting at age 50.
Every 3 years is typically recommended when you choose the stool DNA test for screening.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the US Multi-Society Task Force (MSTF) on Colorectal Cancer recommend testing every 3 years when you choose a stool DNA test as the method of screening for colon cancer. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) suggests every 1 to 3 years. This is because the stool DNA test is still relatively new, and the recommended screening frequency is still evolving.
The ACS advises that people of average risk begin screening at age 45. The MSTF and USPSTF advise that screening for colon cancer should begin at age 50.

Stool DNA

A negative result on the DNA part of the test means the genetic changes associated with colon cancer have not been detected and it is less likely that you have colon cancer.
If the test is positive, then it is more likely that cancer is present, but follow up is required. (See below.)

Stool immunochemical test

A negative result means no hemoglobin was detected in the stool at the time of the test.
A positive result indicates abnormal bleeding in the lower digestive tract. While this bleeding could be caused by colon cancer, other possible causes include ulcers, polyps or hemorrhoids.

Follow-up testing for positive results: The stool DNA test is a screening test. Positive results for either blood and/or DNA changes require follow-up testing. This usually involves direct imaging of the colon and rectum. A colonoscopy is typically recommended because a healthcare practitioner can examine the entire colon and remove any precancerous polyps and/or cancerous areas that are found.
Follow up for negative results: If the stool DNA test is negative, you should continue colon cancer screening at regular intervals. Guidelines recommend that the stool DNA test be repeated in about three years.



","



There are a small number of false positives and false negatives associated with the stool DNA test.
False-negative results: Bleeding, especially from polyps and tumors, is intermittent, so blood is not uniformly distributed in all stool samples and may or may not be present in a specific sample.
The stool DNA test detects changes in specific genes. It is possible to have colon cancer that does not have changes in these genes, so cancer would not be detected with the test.
False-positive results: In the absence of polyps or colon cancer, a false-positive result for blood may be obtained if you have bleeding from other sources, such as hemorrhoids, ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease.



","



This test is used to screen for colon polyps or early colon cancer by detecting digestive tract bleeding and certain gene changes (mutations) in stool, which may be indicators of colon cancer. It is one option for screening if you have an average risk of colon cancer. If cancer is detected early, treatment can begin immediately, improving the chance of a better outcome. Average risk includes people without a family history of colon cancer and those without certain genetic diseases.
This test is not recommended for people who have previously had adenomas of the colon (a specific kind of polyp) and those who have inflammatory bowel disease or increased risk of colon cancer. If you have an increased or high risk of colon cancer, a colonoscopy is usually recommended for screening because it is the most accurate and thorough screen available. See the article on Colon Cancer or the health screening articles for Adults and Adults age 50 and older for additional details.
Guidelines from the US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommend the stool DNA test as a tier 2 test. It is classified as tier 2 because it has some disadvantages compared to the recommended tier 1 tests, which are colonoscopy and annual fecal immunochemical test. (See the article on Colon Cancer for additional details on the different screening options.)

If you are taking pancreatic enzymes, you may be asked to discontinue them for 5 days prior to stool collection.


","

To help detect and evaluate pancreatic insufficiency


","

A fresh formed stool sample that is not contaminated with urine


","



Elastase is an enzyme produced by special (exocrine) tissue in the pancreas. This test measures the amount of elastase in stool (feces) to help evaluate whether a person's pancreas is functioning properly.
The pancreas is an organ located in the abdomen that consists of two kinds of tissues: exocrine and endocrine. The exocrine pancreas is responsible for producing elastase along with other enzymes that are transported to the small intestine to break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates as part of food digestion.
In the digestive tract, elastase is not broken down by other enzymes and is eventually eliminated from the body in the stool. Elastase can be detected and measured in the stool when a person's pancreas is functioning normally. The level in the stool is decreased when the exocrine tissues of the pancreas are not producing sufficient elastase and other digestive enzymes. This condition is called exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurs when the amount of enzymes released and transported to the small intestine is inadequate for proper food digestion and absorption of nutrients. Any condition that blocks the pancreatic ducts or damages or destroy the cells that produce elastase can cause pancreatic insufficiency. It is often seen in conditions such as chronic pancreatitis and sometimes pancreatic cancer. In children, it is most frequently associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) or Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS).
How is the sample collected for testing?
A stool sample is collected in a clean container. The sample should be formed (not watery) and not contaminated with urine or water. The container should be transported promptly to the laboratory, or the sample may be frozen for later transport.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
If you are taking pancreatic enzymes, you may be asked to discontinue them for 5 days prior to stool collection.

Abdominal cramps and bloating
Foul-smelling, bulky, greasy stools
In children, an inability to gain weight, delayed growth
Malabsorption
Malnutrition
Vitamin deficiencies
Weight loss




","



A normal amount of elastase will be present in the stool of healthy individuals.
A decreased amount of stool elastase may mean that the person tested has pancreatic insufficiency. It is not diagnostic, but it does indicate that further testing may be indicated.



","



A stool that is watery, such as with diarrhea, is not a good sample as the water in the stool will dilute the elastase and decrease the amount measured.
If there are not enough pancreatic enzymes (and bile from the liver) available, then fat and other foods cannot be properly digested. If a condition prevents the intestines from absorbing nutrients, then they are ""lost"" by elimination in the stool. In both cases – improper digestion or absorption – the affected person can experience symptoms associated with malabsorption and, in severe cases, symptoms of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.
People with pancreatic dysfunction often need to be monitored closely by their healthcare practitioner. They may find symptom relief and nutritional improvement from prescribed enzymes taken by mouth (oral) and vitamin supplements.



",,"



The elastase test is used along with other tests, such as fecal fat and/or fecal chymotrypsin, to evaluate both children and adults for pancreatic insufficiency.
Pancreatic insufficiency is the inability of the pancreas to produce and/or transport enough digestive enzymes to break down food in the intestine and aid in the absorption of nutrients. It typically occurs as a result of ongoing and worsening pancreatic damage.
The elastase test is most effective at detecting severe insufficiency and not as effective for mild or moderate forms.

A healthcare practitioner uses a tongue depressor to hold down your tongue and then inserts a swab into your mouth and rubs it against the back of your throat and tonsils. The swab may be used to do a rapid strep test in a doctor's office or clinic, or it may be sent to a laboratory. A second swab may be collected along with the first one. This extra sample may be used to perform a throat culture as a follow-up test, when necessary.


","



The bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus or group A strep (GAS), causes strep throat, the most common bacterial cause of inflammation and soreness of the back of the throat (pharyngitis). Strep tests include rapid strep tests and throat cultures that detect these bacteria in a sample taken from the back of your throat.
While most sore throats are caused by a virus and will resolve without treatment within a few days, some people with sore throats have strep throat. Strep throat is most common in children and teens ages 5 to 15 years old. It is important to diagnose and treat strep infections promptly with antibiotics because they are very contagious and complications can develop.

Strep throat can easily spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes and other people come into contact with the droplets or mucus. Touching your face, eyes or mouth after touching something that has these droplets on it can spread the infection. The best way to avoid getting strep throat is to wash your hands thoroughly and often and avoid sharing items like utensils or cups. If you have a sore throat, you should wash your hands often and cover your mouth with a tissue or sleeve when coughing and sneezing.
If strep throat is not diagnosed and treated, complications may develop, especially in children. These complications may include rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart, and glomerulonephritis, which affects the kidneys. Because strep infections are routinely diagnosed and treated, these complications are rare in the United States now, but they do still occur.

A rapid strep test and/or a throat culture is used to diagnose group A strep as the cause of symptoms so your healthcare practitioner can prescribe the proper antibiotics for treatment.

There is a higher suspicion of strep in children with sore throats and when you have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with strep throat. You or your child should see a healthcare provider and get tested when you have signs and symptoms such as:

Sore throat that starts quickly and lasts more than a week, or recurrent sore throats
Fever of 101° F or higher
Reddened (inflamed) throat and/or tonsils with white or yellow patches or streaks

A positive rapid strep test means you have strep throat.
A negative rapid test indicates that you probably do not have strep throat. However, a throat culture may be performed to confirm the results if your healthcare provider still suspects strep, especially among children and teens.

During influenza season, the early symptoms of influenza, such as fever, chills, headache, sore throat, and muscle pain, may mimic strep throat. To differentiate between strep and influenza, a rapid strep test and a rapid influenza test may be done at the same time.
Most people with strep throat would eventually recover without antibiotic treatment, but they would be contagious for a longer period of time and are at a greater risk of developing secondary complications.
Strep throat is most common in children and teens ages 5 to 15. Some school children may be carriers, people who have the bacteria but who have no symptoms. Carriers can still spread the infection to others.
Recent antibiotic therapy or gargling with some mouthwashes may affect the rapid strep test results.



","



Strep tests are used to determine whether your sore throat is strep throat, an infection of the throat and tonsils caused by group A strep (GAS).

Rapid strep tests—a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) can be used to detect group A strep proteins (antigens). Results are typically available in 10-20 minutes. Molecular tests can detect genetic material from group A strep bacteria in throat swab specimens in less than 8 minutes. If the results of the rapid test are positive, further testing is not needed and treatment with an antibiotic can be started right away.
Throat culture—if the rapid strep test is negative, and your healthcare practitioner still suspects strep, a throat culture may be performed. A culture will likely be done for children or teens to confirm the results and avoid missing infections that could lead to serious complications, such as rheumatic fever. A throat culture is more sensitive than the rapid strep test, but it may take 24-48 hours for results.

","

To diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF)


","

A sweat sample collected using a special sweat stimulation procedure (see below)


","



The sweat chloride test measures the amount of chloride in sweat. Chloride is part of the body's electrolyte balance and combines with sodium to form the salt found in sweat. People with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an elevated level of chloride in their sweat.
Normally, chloride travels in and out of the body's cells, helping to maintain electrical neutrality and water balance. This movement occurs through a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). It serves as a channel, letting chloride out of cells and into the surrounding fluid and also reducing sodium absorption. Sodium levels thus usually mirror those of chloride.
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease caused by a mutation in each of the two copies of the CFTR gene (one copy from each parent). With two mutations, the CFTR protein may be dysfunctional or totally absent. With dysfunctional or absent CFTR, chloride does not move out of the ducts into surrounding fluid, resulting in the production of thick, sticky mucus. Since CFTR levels are usually highest in the epithelial cells lining the internal surfaces of the bronchi of the lungs, pancreas, sweat glands, salivary glands, intestine, and reproductive organs, these are the areas most affected by CF. (Read the article on Cystic Fibrosis to learn more.)
Dysfunctional or absent CFTR results in increased chloride in sweat, which can be measured with a sweat test. Two methods of sweat analysis are frequently used:

Sweat chloride concentration is recommended as the diagnostic test for CF.
Sweat conductivity testing may be used to screen for CF.

How is the sample collected for testing?
A sweat sample is collected using a special sweat stimulation procedure. (See above)
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No special preparation is needed. However, you may be instructed to avoid applying creams or lotions to your skin 24 hours before the test. It is also important to be well-hydrated before undergoing the procedure.

When an infant has a positive newborn screening test for CF; when you or your child has signs and symptoms that suggest CF or tested positive or indeterminate for CF with other tests


","



The sweat chloride test is ordered when an infant has a positive newborn screening test for cystic fibrosis (CF). The sweat test cannot be performed accurately in the first two days after birth. It is typically ordered between 2 and 4 weeks of age. However, it may be difficult to collect enough sweat from some infants for testing, especially premature babies. If an insufficient sample is obtained, then testing should be repeated.
The sweat chloride test may also be ordered when an older child or adult has signs and symptoms of CF and/or has a close relative who has been diagnosed with CF.
Examples of signs and symptoms of CF include:

Frequent coughing, chronic cough producing thick, sticky mucus (sometimes bloody)
Repeated or persistent respiratory infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia
Recurrent sinus infections and nasal congestion caused by nasal polyps
Abdominal pain or discomfort
In newborns, no stools produced soon after birth (meconium ileus)
Chronic diarrhea or foul-smelling, greasy stools
Weight loss or malnutrition
Failure to thrive — large appetite but failure to gain weight or grow at a normal rate
Decreased levels of protein in the blood causing excess fluid accumulation just under the skin or within cavities of the body (edema)

It may also be ordered when someone has tested negative with a standard CF gene mutation panel but is clinically still suspected of having CF.



","



A positive sweat chloride test indicates that it is likely that the infant or person tested has cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive sweat chloride tests are typically repeated for verification. The results may also be confirmed by CF gene mutation panel testing.
A negative sweat chloride test means that it is unlikely the person tested has CF. However, a few people with CF will have a normal or inconclusive sweat chloride test. The sweat test may be repeated or the person will have to be evaluated using other tests. Sometimes the diagnosis may be made on clinical grounds alone.



","



There are other conditions besides cystic fibrosis that can cause positive sweat chloride tests. These include anorexia nervosa, Addison disease, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and hypothyroidism.
Excessive build-up of fluid (edema) can result in a false-negative result.



",,"



The sweat chloride test is often used to help diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF) in infants who have tested positive on a newborn screening test for CF, such as an immunoreactive trypsinogen test (IRT) or CF gene mutation test.
The sweat chloride test may also be used to test for cystic fibrosis in symptomatic older children and adults. It may be used to help confirm or rule out a diagnosis of CF in those who have tested positive or indeterminate with other tests, including a screening sweat test and/or the nasal (transepithelial) potential difference (NPD) test.
It may also be ordered in the case of people who have tested negative with a standard CF gene mutation panel but who are still suspected of having CF due to signs and symptoms. The CF gene mutation panel generally tests for the most common CF gene mutations. If the panel is negative, then the person may not have CF or may have less common mutations not included in the screening panel. Sweat chloride testing may be diagnostic of CF even if the genetic mutations causing it cannot be identified. This testing may also be used to determine if additional mutation analysis is warranted.

To help diagnose the cause of joint inflammation, pain, and/or swelling


","

A synovial fluid sample is obtained by inserting a needle into the space between the bones at a joint


","



Synovial fluid is a thick liquid that acts as a lubricant for the body's major joints. It is found in small quantities in the spaces between the joints, where the fluid is produced and contained by synovial membranes. Synovial fluid cushions bone ends and reduces friction during joint movement in the knees, shoulders, hips, hands, and feet.
Synovial fluid analysis consists of a group of tests that detect synovial fluid changes and may indicate the presence of diseases affecting joint structure and function. The analysis usually involves an initial basic set of tests, followed by additional tests selected based on the results of the first set of tests, the person's symptoms, and the disease that the healthcare practitioner suspects is causing the symptoms. Tests can be grouped according to:

Physical characteristics—an evaluation of the fluid's appearance
Chemical tests—detect changes in the fluid's chemical constituents 
Microscopic examination— cells and crystals that may be present are counted and identified by type under a microscope
Infectious disease tests—detect and identify microbes, if present

How is the sample collected for testing?
A sample of synovial fluid is collected from the affected joint with a syringe and needle using a procedure called an arthrocentesis.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Consult with the healthcare provider about test preparation. Synovial fluid collection and analysis may be performed after fasting or at random.

Synovial fluid analysis may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a condition or disease involving one or more of their joints. It may be ordered when someone has some combination of the following signs and symptoms:

Joint pain
Redness over the joint
Joint inflammation and swelling
Synovial fluid accumulation

It may sometimes be ordered to monitor a person with a known joint condition.



","



Synovial fluid usually contains a small amount of glucose and protein and may have a few white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs).
There are a variety of joint abnormalities, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and infection (septic arthritis), that can cause inflammation, swelling, an accumulation of synovial fluid, and sometimes bleeding into one or more joints. These conditions can limit mobility and, if left untreated, may permanently damage the joints.
Results of tests performed on a sample of synovial fluid may include:
Physical characteristics – the normal appearance of a sample of synovial fluid is usually:

Straw colored
Clear
Moderately viscous – drops of it from a syringe needle will form a ""string"" a few inches long.

Changes in the physical characteristics may provide clues to the disease present, such as:

Less viscous fluid may be seen with inflammation.
Cloudy synovial fluid may indicate the presence of microbes, white blood cells, or crystals.
Reddish synovial fluid may indicate the presence of blood, but an increased number of red blood cells may also be present in cloudy synovial fluid.

An individual's joint may be affected by more than one of these physical changes at a time.
Chemical tests – tests that may be performed on synovial fluid samples include:

Glucose—typically a bit lower than blood glucose levels; may be significantly lower with joint inflammation and infection.
Protein—increased with bacterial infection
Uric acid—increased with gout

Microscopic examination – Normal synovial fluid has small numbers of white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs) but no microbes or crystals present. Laboratories may examine drops of the synovial fluid and/or use a special centrifuge (cytocentrifuge) to concentrate the fluid's cells at the bottom of a test tube. Samples are placed on a slide, treated with special stain, and an evaluation of the different kinds of cells present is performed.

Total cell counts—number of WBCs and RBCs in the sample; increased WBCs may be seen with infections and with conditions such as gout and rheumatoid arthritis.
A WBC differential determines the percentages of different types of WBCs. An increased number of neutrophils may be seen with bacterial infections. Greater than 2% eosinophils may suggest Lyme disease, parasitic arthritis, rheumatoid disease, or tubercular arthritis.
Synovial fluid is evaluated under polarized light to recognize the presence of crystals and to distinguish the types of crystals that are present. Needle-like monosodium urate crystals are associated with gout and calcium pyrophosphate crystals are associated with pseudogout.

Infectious disease tests – in addition to chemistry tests, other tests may be performed to look for microbes if infection is suspected.

Gram stain allows for the direct observation of bacteria or fungi under a microscope. There should be no microbes present in synovial fluid.
Culture and susceptibility testing is ordered to determine what type of microbes are present. If bacteria are present, susceptibility testing against certain antibiotics can be performed to guide antimicrobial therapy. If there are no microbes present, it does not rule out an infection; they may be present in small numbers or their growth may be inhibited because of prior antibiotic therapy.
Other tests for infectious diseases that are less commonly ordered include AFB testing. This test for the presence of mycobacteria may help diagnose tuberculosis. Molecular test methods for Mycobacteria tuberculosis are more sensitive and specific than traditional cultures and may also be performed.




","



A blood or urine uric acid or blood glucose test may be ordered to compare concentrations with those in the synovial fluid. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that an individual has a systemic infection, then a blood culture may be ordered in addition to the synovial fluid analysis.
Joint injury, surgery, and joint replacement can increase the risk of developing an infection in a joint.



",,"



Synovial fluid analysis may be ordered to help diagnose the cause of joint inflammation, pain, swelling, and fluid accumulation. Diseases and conditions affecting one or more joints and the synovial fluid can be divided into four main categories:

Infectious diseases – those caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses. They may originate in the joint or spread there from other places in the body. These conditions include acute and chronic septic arthritis.
Bleeding – bleeding disorders and/or joint injury can lead to blood in the synovial fluid. This is commonly present in people with untreated blood clotting disorders such as hemophilia or von Willebrand disease.
Inflammatory diseases –

Conditions that cause crystal formation and accumulation such as gout (needle-like uric acid crystals) and pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals). These typically affect the feet and legs.
Conditions that cause joint inflammation, such as synovitis, or other immune responses. These may include autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Syphilis is an infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum that is most often spread by sexual contact, such as through direct contact with a syphilis sore (chancre), a firm, raised, painless sore. The most common syphilis tests detect antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to a T. pallidum infection. Some methods that are used less commonly directly detect the bacterium or its genetic material (DNA).
Syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics but can cause severe health problems if left untreated. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her unborn child, with serious and potentially fatal consequences for the baby. (See Common Questions below)
There are several possible stages with syphilis:

Primary syphilis—the primary stage begins about 2-3 weeks after being infected. One or more chancres appear, usually on the part of the body exposed to the sexual partner's chancre, such as on the penis or vagina. However, the chancre is usually painless and may go unnoticed, especially if it is in the rectum or on the cervix, and disappears within 4-6 weeks, healing regardless of whether the infected person is treated or not.
Secondary syphilis—if primary syphilis is left untreated, secondary syphilis may occur from 6 weeks to 6 months after the chancre first appears. It is marked by a skin rash that often is rough, red, and spotted, appearing frequently on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet (an unusual place for most other causes of rashes) and that usually does not itch. There may be other symptoms as well, such as fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes (""glands""), sore throat, and body aches.
Late, tertiary syphilis—if untreated, secondary syphilis may continue into a latent stage, during which an infected person has no symptoms but continues to have the infection, and this stage can last for years. If still untreated, about 15% of people will develop the complications of late, or tertiary, syphilis. In these cases, the bacteria can damage the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones, joints, or almost any other part of the body. When the central nervous system is affected, it is called neurosyphilis. Tertiary syphilis can last for years, with the final stage leading to mental illness, blindness, other neurological problems, heart disease, and death.

Syphilis is most infectious during the primary and secondary stages. In 2014, about one-third of over 63,000 new cases of syphilis reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were primary or secondary stage syphilis. Eighty-three percent of these cases were among men who have sex with men.
Syphilis can be treated with antibiotics, preferably penicillin. Newly acquired infections can be cured easily; however, longer treatment may be needed for someone who has been infected for more than a year.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Depending on the stage of disease and test method used, different samples are needed:

Most often, blood is drawn from a vein in the arm to test for antibodies.
If a syphilis sore is present, a healthcare practitioner may take a scraping from the chancre on the affected area, such as the cervix, penis, anus, or throat.
If someone has late or latent stages of the disease with suspected brain involvement (neurosyphilis), the healthcare provider will perform a spinal tap to check the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for infection.

When you have symptoms of a syphilis infection; when you are at risk of being exposed to syphilis, such as when you have another STD or HIV infection, are a man who has sex with men, have a sexual partner diagnosed with syphilis, or have engaged in high-risk sexual activity; when you are pregnant


","



A syphilis test may be ordered when a person has signs and symptoms, such as:

A chancre on the genitals or throat
A skin rash that often is rough, red, and spotted, appearing frequently on the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet (an unusual place for most other causes of rashes) and that usually does not itch, with or without other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes (""glands""), sore throat, and body aches

Screening for syphilis is recommended, regardless of symptoms, when a person:

Is being treated for another sexually transmitted disease, such as gonorrhea
Is pregnant, during the first prenatal visit and again in the third trimester and at delivery if the woman is at high risk
Is a man who has sex with men; testing should be done at least yearly or every 3-6 months if at high risk
Engages in high-risk sexual activity, such as having unprotected sex with multiple partners
Has HIV infection, when first diagnosed and then at least yearly; may be done more frequently if at high risk
Has one or more partners who have tested positive for syphilis
Has been informed by public health officials that he or she has been exposed to an infected partner

The CDC recommends follow-up testing, such as measuring the level of antibodies (e.g., RPR titers), when a person has been treated for syphilis to be sure that treatment is successful and the infection cured.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting results from tests for syphilis.
Antibody tests:
A negative blood test means that it is likely that no infection is present. However, a negative screening test means only that there is no evidence of disease at the time of the test. Antibodies may not be detected for several weeks after exposure to the bacteria. If a person knows he or she has been exposed, or if suspicion of infection remains high, then repeat testing at a later date may be required. It is also important for those who are at increased risk of syphilis infection to have screening tests performed regularly to check for possible infection.
A positive RPR or VDRL screen must be followed by a specific treponemal antibody test (e.g., FTA-ABS, TP-PA):

A positive result on the second method confirms the screening result and the affected person is diagnosed with syphilis.
A negative result on the treponemal test may mean that the initial RPR or VDRL test was falsely positive. Further testing and investigation may be done to determine the cause of the false positive.

Alternatively, a healthcare practitioner or laboratory will use a treponemal antibody test (FTA-ABS, TP-PA, IA) as an initial test. A positive result indicates the presence of syphilis antibodies in the blood, but since treponemal antibodies remain positive even after an infection has been treated, it does not indicate whether the person has a current infection or was infected in the past. Conversely, nontreponemal antibodies as detected with an RPR typically disappear in an adequately treated person after about 3 years. Thus, if an initial treponemal test is positive, an RPR can be performed to differentiate between an active or past infection. In this case, a positive RPR would confirm that the person has been exposed to syphilis and, if not treated previously, has an active infection or, if treatment had occurred more than 3 years ago, possible re-infection.
For monitoring treatment and/or determining if treatment was successful, the results of one or more RPR titers may be evaluated. Syphilis antibodies should be lower following treatment. For example, if the RPR was initially reported as 1:256, a value of 1:16 after treatment would indicate a lower level of antibody. If the titer remains the same or rises, the affected person may have a persistent infection or was reinfected. Results may also be expressed as dilutions (e.g., 1/16) or converted to a whole number (e.g., 16 dils).
CSF tests:
Results of syphilis tests performed on CSF samples, usually when someone has late or latent stages of the disease with suspected brain involvement (neurosyphilis), are often interpreted in conjunction with a blood test as well as the affected person's signs, symptoms, and medical history.
A positive VDRL or FTA-ABS result on a sample of CSF indicates likely infection of the central nervous system. A negative result, especially on an FTA-ABS, may help to rule out infection of the central nervous system.
Direct detection:
If a scraping from a suspected syphilis sore reveals presence of the syphilis bacteria (a positive test on either darkfield microscopy or PCR), the person being tested has an infection that requires treatment with a course of antibiotics, preferably penicillin.
A negative result from a scraping may mean that there is no syphilis infection present and symptoms are due to another cause or that there were insufficient bacteria present in the sample to be detected.

After successful treatment, nontreponemal antibodies disappear over time; treponemal antibodies are present in the blood for life.



","



The different tests available to screen for and diagnose syphilis vary in their accuracy depending on the stage of disease.
If you are sexually active, you should consult a healthcare practitioner about any suspicious rash or sore in the genital area; there are many other sexually transmitted diseases besides syphilis. If you are infected, tell your sexual partner(s) to get tested and treated.
The risk of contracting other STDs increases if you have syphilis sores. You are 2 to 5 times more likely to be infected with HIV, if exposed, when syphilis sores are present, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If you have such chancres and have not been diagnosed with HIV, you should be tested for HIV.

Syphilis tests are used to screen for and/or diagnose infection with Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. 
Several different types of tests are available. Antibody tests are most commonly used.
Antibody tests (serology)—these tests detect antibodies in the blood and sometimes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Two general types are available for syphilis testing, nontreponemal antibody test and treponemal antibody test (derived from the name of the bacterium). Either type may be used for syphilis screening but must be followed by a second test that uses a different method to confirm a positive result and to diagnose active syphilis:

Nontreponemal antibody tests--these tests are called ""nontreponemal"" because they detect antibodies that are not specifically directed against the Treponema pallidum bacterium. These antibodies are produced by the body when an individual has syphilis but may also be produced in several other conditions. The tests are highly sensitive but, since they are non-specific, false-positive results can be caused by, for example, IV drug use, pregnancy, Lyme disease, certain types of pneumonia, malaria, tuberculosis, or certain autoimmune disorders including lupus. A positive screening result must be confirmed with a more specific (treponemal) test. Nontreponemal tests include:

	
RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin)--in addition to screening, this test is useful in monitoring treatment for syphilis. For this purpose, the level (titer) of antibody is measured. It may also be used to confirm the presence of an active infection when an initial test for treponemal antibodies is positive (see below).
VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory)--in addition to blood, this test is primarily performed on CSF to help diagnose neurosyphilis.


Treponemal antibody tests--these blood tests detect antibodies that specifically target T. pallidum. They are highly specific for syphilis, meaning other conditions are unlikely to cause a positive result. However, once a person is infected and these antibodies develop, they remain in the blood for life. By comparison, nontreponemal antibodies typically disappear in an adequately treated person after about 3 years. Therefore, a positive treponemal screening result must be followed by a nontreponemal test (such as RPR) to differentiate between an active infection (or reinfection) and one that occurred in the past and was successfully treated. Treponemal antibody tests include:
	
FTA-ABS (Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption)--this test is useful after the first 3-4 weeks following exposure. In addition to blood testing, it can be used to measure antibodies to T. pallidum in the CSF to help diagnose neurosyphilis.
TP-PA (T. pallidum particle agglutination assay)--this test is sometimes performed instead of FTA-ABS because it is more specific and there are fewer false positives.
MHA-TP (Microhemagglutination assay)--another confirmatory method; this test is used much less commonly now.
Immunoassays (IA)--in more recent years, several automated tests have been developed, making them convenient for screening purposes.



Direct detection of bacteria—these tests are less commonly performed:

Darkfield microscopy--this method may be used in the early stages of syphilis when a suspected syphilis sore (chancre) is present. It involves obtaining a scraping of the sore, placing it on a slide, and examining it with a special instrument called a dark-field microscope.
Molecular testing (polymerase chain reaction, PCR)--this test detects genetic material from the bacteria in the sample from the sore, in blood, or in CSF.
	 

Syphilis Tests

The following table summarizes the stages of syphilis and types of tests that may be used:


Stages of disease:
Exposure to bacteria
Chancre, ""Primary syphilis""
Skin eruptions, ""Secondary syphilis""
Neurological disease, ""Tertiary syphilis""


The time after exposure that these stages may occur if the person is not treated
Day 1
10-90 days
6 weeks to 6 months
10-30 years


Description
Transmission of syphilis occurs during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Pregnant women with the disease can transmit it to unborn child. First-time infection provides no immunity; re-infection can occur if exposed again.
Appearance of a single sore, though there may be multiple sores at the location(s) where the bacteria entered the body. The sore is usually firm, round, and painless and can easily go unnoticed. It lasts 3-6 weeks and heals regardless of whether or not the person is treated.
Rash on one or more areas of the body can appear from the time when the primary sore is healing to several weeks after the sore has healed. Rash usually does not itch and is unusual in that it can occur on palms of hands and soles of feet.
Skin lesions or nodules called granulomas (gummas) appear, degenerative changes in CNS (numbness, paralysis, gradual blindness, dementia), and cardiovascular lesions


Antibody tests:

None needed; however, certain medications, multivitamins and supplements can interfere with the free T3 and total T3 tests, so tell your healthcare practitioner about any prescribed or over-the-counter drugs and/or supplements that you are taking. Acute illness may affect thyroid testing test results.

","



Triiodothyronine (T3) is one of two major hormones produced by the thyroid gland, a small butterfly-shaped organ that lies flat across the windpipe at the base of the throat. The other major thyroid hormone is called thyroxine (T4) and together they help control the rate at which the body uses energy. Almost all of the T3 (and T4) found in the blood is bound to protein. The rest is free (unbound) and is the biologically active form of the hormone. Tests can measure the amount of free T3 or the total T3 (bound plus unbound) in the blood.
Most of the hormone produced by the thyroid is T4. This hormone is relatively inactive, but it is converted into the much more active T3 in the liver and other tissues.
T3 levels are regulated by the feedback system that the body uses to maintain stable amounts of thyroid hormones in the blood. T4 and TSH, along with its regulatory hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which comes from the hypothalamus, are also part of the feedback system.

When blood levels of thyroid hormones decline, the pituitary gland produces and releases TSH in response to TRH stimulation. TSH then stimulates the thyroid gland to produce and/or release more T4 and T3.
When thyroid hormone levels increase in the blood, the pituitary gland produces less TSH and the thyroid produces less T4 and T3.

When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid gland produces excessive amounts of T4 and T3, then the person affected may have symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as nervousness, tremors of the hands, weight loss, insomnia, and puffiness around dry, irritated eyes and in some cases, bulging eyes. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. (See the article on Graves Disease.)
If the thyroid gland produces insufficient amounts of T4 and T3, then the person may have signs and symptoms associated with underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and a slowed metabolism, such as weight gain, dry skin, fatigue, and constipation. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. (See the article on Hashimoto Thyroiditis for more details.)
Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and excessive or deficient production of TSH. The effect of these conditions on thyroid hormone production can be detected and monitored by measuring the free T3 or sometimes total T3.

When you have an abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), particularly with a normal free thyroxine (T4) result, and/or signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism


","



A free T3 or total T3 test may be ordered when someone has an abnormal TSH test result. It may be ordered as part of the investigative workup when a person has symptoms suggesting hyperthyroidism, especially if the free T4 level is not elevated.
Signs and symptoms may include:

Increased heart rate
Anxiety
Weight loss
Difficulty sleeping
Tremors in the hands
Weakness
Diarrhea (sometimes)
Light sensitivity, visual disturbances
The eyes may be affected: puffiness around the eyes, dryness, irritation, and, in some cases, bulging of the eyes.
	 

Free or total T3 may sometimes be ordered at intervals to monitor a known thyroid condition and to help monitor the effectiveness of treatment for hyperthyroidism.



","



Total T3 or free T3 results are typically evaluated with other thyroid testing results (i.e., TSH and T4).
In general, high total or free T3 results may indicate an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) and low total or free T3 results may indicate an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). The test results alone are not diagnostic but will prompt the healthcare practitioner to perform additional testing to investigate the cause of the excess or deficiency.
When used for monitoring treatment for thyroid or pituitary disorders, results of thyroid tests will inform the healthcare practitioner whether treatment is effective and/or whether an adjustment to dose is necessary. For example, in people with hyperthyroidism, free T4, free T3, and TSH are regularly checked while they are on anti-thyroid drugs to assure that the drugs are working and to decrease doses if thyroid hormone levels get too low. In people with hypothyroidism, TSH and free T4 are regularly checked to assure that the right dose of thyroid hormone is being given to make TSH normal.
The following table summarizes some examples of typical test results and their potential meaning.



Note: Laboratory results must always be correlated with the clinical findings of the patient.

1In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is applied when the TSH level is elevated and the free T4 level is normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hypothyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, subclinical hypothyroidism places affected adults at somewhat increased risk for an elevated LDL cholesterol level, increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and reduced mental acuity.
2In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism is applied when the TSH level is decreased and the free T4 level and T3 levels are normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, subclinical hyperthyroidism places affected persons at somewhat increased risk for atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.



","



It is important to note that thyroid tests are a ""snapshot"" of what is occurring within a dynamic system. An individual person's total T3, free T3, total T4, free T4, and/or TSH results may vary and may be affected by:

Increases, decreases, and changes (inherited or acquired) in the proteins that bind T4 and T3 (This is important for tests that measure total T3, but it is not likely important for free T4 and free T3 tests, which measure the thyroid hormones that are not bound to protein.)
Pregnancy
Liver disease
Systemic illness
Rarely, resistance to thyroid hormones
	 




","



A free or total triiodothyronine (free T3 or total T3) test is used to assess thyroid function. It is ordered primarily to help diagnose hyperthyroidism and may be ordered to help monitor treatment of a person with a known thyroid disorder.
Most of the T4 and T3 circulates in the blood bound to protein, while a small percentage is free (not bound). Blood tests can measure total T4 (unbound plus bound), free T4, total T3 (bound plus unbound), or free T3.
Since most T3 is bound to protein, the total T3 can be affected by protein levels and protein binding ability, but the free T3 is not. However, some professional guidelines recommend the total T3, so either test may be used to assess thyroid function. For example, free T3 or sometimes total T3 may be ordered along with thyroid antibodies to help diagnose Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.
The free or total T3 test is usually ordered following an abnormal TSH, particularly if the free T4 test is not elevated.

When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid gland does not produce sufficient T4 and T3 (underactive thyroid), due to thyroid dysfunction or to insufficient TSH, then the affected person experiences symptoms of hypothyroidism such as weight gain, dry skin, cold intolerance, irregular menstruation, and fatigue. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. (See the article on Hashimoto thyroiditis for more details.)
If the thyroid gland produces too much T4 and T3, the affected person may experience symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as rapid heart rate, anxiety, weight loss, difficulty sleeping, tremors in the hands, and puffiness around dry, irritated eyes and in some cases, bulging eyes. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. (See the article on Graves disease for more details.)
Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroiditis, thyroid cancer, and excessive or deficient production of TSH. The effect of these conditions on thyroid hormone production can be detected and monitored by measuring the free T4.

The test results alone are not diagnostic but will prompt the healthcare practitioner to perform additional testing to investigate the cause of the excess or deficiency.
Both decreased and increased free T4 results are associated with a variety of temporary and chronic thyroid conditions. Low free T4 results in conjunction with a low TSH level or high free T4 results along with a high TSH may indicate a pituitary gland condition.
When used for monitoring treatment for thyroid or pituitary disorders, results of thyroid tests will inform the healthcare practitioner whether treatment is effective and/or whether an adjustment to dose is necessary. For example, in people with hyperthyroidism, free T4, free T3, and TSH are regularly checked while they are on anti-thyroid drugs to assure that the drugs are working and to decrease doses if thyroid hormone levels get too low. In people with hypothyroidism, TSH and free T4 are regularly checked to assure that the right dose of thyroid hormone is being given to make TSH normal.
The following table summarizes some examples of typical test results and their potential meaning.



Note: Laboratory results must always be correlated with the clinical findings of the patient.

1In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is applied when the TSH level is elevated and the free T4 level is normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hypothyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, subclinical hypothyroidism places affected adults at somewhat increased risk for an elevated LDL cholesterol level, increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and reduced mental acuity.
2In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism is applied when the TSH level is decreased and the free T4 level and T3 levels are normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, subclinical hyperthyroidism places affected persons at somewhat increased risk for atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.



","



It is important to note that thyroid tests are a ""snapshot"" of what is occurring within a dynamic system. An individual person's results may vary and may be affected by:

Increases, decreases, and changes (inherited or acquired) in the proteins that bind T4 and T3 (This is important for tests that measure total T3, but it is not likely important for free T4 and free T3 tests, which measure the thyroid hormones that are not bound to protein.)
Pregnancy
Liver disease
Systemic illness
Rarely, resistance to thyroid hormones
	 




","



Free thyroxine (free T4) tests are used to help evaluate thyroid function and diagnose thyroid diseases, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, usually after discovering that the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is abnormal.
Most of the T4 and T3 circulate in the blood bound to protein, while a small percentage is free (unbound). Blood tests can measure total T4, free T4, total T3, or free T3. The total T4 test has been used for many years, but it can be affected by the amount of protein available in the blood to bind to the hormone. Free T4 is not affected by protein levels and is the active form of thyroxine. The free T4 test is thought by many to be a more accurate reflection of thyroid hormone function and, in most cases, its use has replaced that of the total T4 test.
A free T4 test may be used along with or following a TSH test and sometimes with a total or free T3 test to:

Help detect too much or too little thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism) and diagnose the cause
Distinguish between different thyroid disorders
Monitor the effectiveness of treatment in a person with known thyroid disorder
Monitor individuals with thyroid cancer, in which the tumors respond to TSH. TSH and T4 levels will be regularly checked to make sure that enough thyroid hormone is being given to keep TSH low without making T4 too high.
Help evaluate the function of the pituitary gland (occasionally)

At present, screening the general population for thyroid disorders is not recommended. However, expert opinions vary on this. In 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for thyroid disease in asymptomatic adults.
On the other hand, guidelines released in 2012 by the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists summarize recommendations endorsed by several societies. They say that screening for hypothyroidism should be considered in people over the age of 60. Because the signs and symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are so similar to those seen in many common disorders, healthcare practitioners often need to rule out thyroid disease even though the patient has another problem.
If a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone may have an autoimmune-related thyroid condition, then thyroid antibodies may be ordered along with a free T4 test.

tacrolimus,"['FK506', 'TAC']","

The sample should be collected 12 hours after your last dose and immediately prior to your next dose or as directed by your healthcare practitioner.


","

To determine the level of the drug tacrolimus in your blood in order to establish a dosing regimen, maintain therapeutic levels, and detect toxic levels


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Tacrolimus, also known as FK506, is an immunosuppressive drug that is given orally or intravenously to people who have had a kidney, liver, heart, or other organ transplant. It is a potent drug that helps to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ by the body. This test measures the amount of tacrolimus in the blood.
Normally, a person's immune system recognizes a new, transplanted organ as foreign and begin to attack it. Tacrolimus limits this response and helps to prevent organ rejection by inhibiting the activation of certain immune cells called T-lymphocytes.
The level of tacrolimus in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the concentration is too low, organ rejection may occur; if it is too high, then the person may experience symptoms associated with toxicity.
Dosages must be tailored to the individual. Often, people will begin with higher doses of tacrolimus at the start of therapy and then decrease the dose over the next few weeks.
Tacrolimus is usually taken twice a day at set intervals before or after meals. When a person takes a dose, the blood concentration rises and peaks within about 2 to 3 hours and then begins to slowly drop. The blood test is usually measured as a ""trough level,"" meaning that sample collection is timed for 12 hours post-dose and/or immediately prior to the next dose, when the drug's level in the blood is at its lowest.

","

As soon as tacrolimus therapy begins, frequently at first, then at regular intervals to monitor concentrations over time


","



A tacrolimus test is ordered frequently at the start of therapy, often daily when trying to establish a dosing regimen. Once dosages have been established and shown to be well tolerated, the frequency of tacrolimus testing may be decreased. The test is also performed when dosages are changed and whenever someone has symptoms that suggest side effects, toxicity, or organ rejection.
Signs and symptoms of tacrolimus toxicity vary according to the type of organ transplant and may include:

Kidney damage (nephrotoxicity)
Tremors, headache (neurotoxicity)
High blood pressure
Nausea and vomiting
Electrolyte disturbances, such as hyperkalemia
Intermittent and/or persistent ringing or roaring in the ears (tinnitus)
Seizures
Elevated heartbeat
Blurred vision

Monitoring at intervals is necessary as long as someone is taking tacrolimus.



","



A concentration that is higher than the established therapeutic range may increase the risk of associated toxicity, including damage to the kidneys and nerves. A concentration that is too low may lead to rejection of the transplanted organ. Side effects may be seen at any dosage but tend to be more severe with a higher tacrolimus level.
The therapeutic range established by a laboratory will depend on both the method used to measure the drug and the type of transplant. Results from different methods are not interchangeable. A healthcare practitioner will usually send samples sent consistently to the same laboratory and will be guided by that laboratory's therapeutic ranges.



","



A variety of drugs can increase or decrease tacrolimus levels in the blood. These include calcium channel blockers, antifungal drugs, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin), protease inhibitors, chloramphenicol, and other immunosuppressants, anticonvulsants, and antimicrobials. Tell your healthcare practitioner about any other medications you take, especially cyclosporine, sirolimus, nelfinavir telaprevir, boceprevir, and amiodarone. Many other prescription drugs, grapefruit juice, and herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort can also interact with tacrolimus.
Topical tacrolimus may be used to treat a variety of skin conditions, such as eczema, that have not responded well to other medications. This topical use of tacrolimus is intended to be local, not systemic, and is not usually monitored.
Tacrolimus increases the risk of developing malignancies such as lymphoma and skin cancer, so sunlight should be avoided when taking this drug. It can also cause new onset diabetes, especially in African Americans and Hispanics so a healthcare practitioner may monitor a person's glucose levels. Tacrolimus may also cause QT prolongation, a condition that affects heart rhythm.
People should not alter their dose or the time that they take their dose without consulting with their healthcare provider. Tacrolimus should be taken consistently with respect to meals. Food, especially high-fat meals, can significantly reduce the bioavailability (amount of the drug that reaches the circulation) compared with fasting.
Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should talk to their healthcare practitioner about associated risks.



",,"



The tacrolimus test is used to measure the amount of the drug in the blood to determine whether the concentration has reached a therapeutic level and is below the toxic level. It is important to monitor levels of tacrolimus for several reasons:

There is not a good correlation between the dose of tacrolimus given and the level of drug in the blood.
How individuals absorb and metabolize oral doses of tacrolimus can vary greatly depending on the time of the dose and what, if any, food the person has eaten as well as the genes they have inherited (read Pharmacogenetic Tests).
Tacrolimus can cause kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), especially in high doses. Measuring levels in people who have had a kidney transplant may help to distinguish between kidney damage due to rejection (because drug level is low) and kidney damage due to tacrolimus toxicity (drug level is high).
Tacrolimus can increase the risk of developing serious bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections because it decreases the body's immune response.

tau-protein-and-beta-amyloid,['Alzheimer Biomarkers'],"

Your healthcare practitioner will advise you on how you need to prepare for the test.


","

To help distinguish between Alzheimer disease and other forms of dementia


","

A sample of cerebrospinal fluid collected using a lumbar puncture (spinal tap)


","



Two separate laboratory tests can measure amyloid beta 42 (beta amyloid) and tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These tests are often done at the same time to help evaluate an individual for Alzheimer disease (AD).

Amyloid beta 42 is a peptide (protein fragment). Increased production of amyloid beta 42 in the brain can lead to the formation of amyloid plaques.
Tau is a structural protein in the brain. Tau protein containing many phosphorus groups (P-tau) can produce neurofibrillary tangles, which are twisted protein fragments that develop in nerve cells and disrupt the cells' ability to transport signals.

Neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are considered to be the main diagnostic features of Alzheimer disease.
The measurements of tau and beta amyloid in CSF are being evaluated for potential roles in the diagnosis and monitoring of AD. It has been shown that a decrease in beta amyloid with elevated tau or P-tau levels may predict the onset of AD.

","

These tests may be ordered along with cognitive and brain-imaging tests in people who demonstrate some form of dementia. These tests are not routine laboratory tests and are typically available only in research settings or memory clinics.


","



Tau protein and beta amyloid tests are primarily performed in research settings and in some memory clinics. The tests may be done along with cognitive tests and brain scans when an individual has signs and symptoms of Alzheimer disease, such as:

Loss of memory that affects daily life—forgetting information that was recently learned. This can occur with normal aging, but the information is usually remembered later. This includes forgetting important dates or events, having to rely on memory aids, and asking for the same information again and again.
Difficulty planning or problem solving, such as keeping track of bills and payments
Problems completing usual tasks, such as forgetting how to get to a familiar location
Confusion about place or time—losing track of time, forgetting where you are or how you got there
Increasing difficulty reading or judging distances
Problems speaking or writing—forgetting words, repeating the same thing, struggling with vocabulary
Losing things more frequently and not being able to logically retrace steps to find them
Impaired judgment, such as giving away unusually large amounts of money
Increasing withdrawal from activities, including social, work or family events
Changes in mood and personality, such as increasing anxiety, fear, suspicion and depression

Some healthcare practitioners may order these tests for other reasons; however, information on how to interpret the results outside of the settings described above is limited.



","



In a person with symptoms, a low beta amyloid CSF level along with a high tau protein level reflects an increased likelihood of Alzheimer disease. However, these abnormal results can also occur in other conditions.



","



The clinical use of these tests continues to evolve. For instance, multiple variants of amyloid beta protein, such as amyloid beta 40 and amyloid beta 38, have been identified and are being researched for their potential use as AD biomarkers. Other CSF and blood tests for AD are also being researched.



","



Lab tests for tau protein and beta amyloid may be used as supplemental tests to help evaluate a person suspected of having Alzheimer disease (AD) and to distinguish between AD and other forms of dementia. These tests are not widely used or routinely ordered. Use of these tests is limited to people suspected of having dementia, and testing is typically performed after other causes of a person's symptoms have been ruled out.

tb-skin-test,"['Purified Protein Derivative', 'PPD', 'Mantoux', 'Latent Tuberculosis Infection Test']","

None

To screen for tuberculosis (TB) active or latent infection


","

No sample is required. A small amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) solution is injected with a tuberculin syringe just under the first layer of skin of your inner forearm.


","



Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB primarily targets the lungs but may affect any area of the body such as the urinary tract, central nervous system, bones, joints, and/or other organs. TB screening tests help to determine whether a person has become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. A TB skin test measures the body's immune response to antigens derived from these bacteria.
TB may cause an inactive (latent) infection or an active, progressive disease. The immune system of about 90% of people who become infected with TB manages to control its growth and confine the TB infection to a few cells in the body. The bacteria in these cells are inactive but still alive. The person does not have any symptoms and is not infectious but does have a ""latent TB infection.""
If, after some time, the immune system of an individual with an inactive infection becomes weakened (compromised), the mycobacteria may begin to grow again, leading to an active case of tuberculosis disease. Active TB does cause illness and can be passed to others through respiratory secretions such as sputum or aerosols released by coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking, singing, or breathing.
A tuberculin skin test cannot distinguish between latent and active infections. Additional tests, such as AFB testing, are required to help establish a diagnosis of an active TB infection.
How is the sample collected for testing?
No sample is required. The test is performed on a person's skin. A purified protein derivative (PPD) solution that contains M. tuberculosis antigens, but not live bacteria, is used to provoke a hypersensitivity skin reaction (a red, raised bump) in those who have been infected by TB.
A healthcare practitioner will wipe the inner forearm with alcohol and let the skin dry. Using a 1cc syringe and a tiny needle, the healthcare practitioner will then inject a small amount of PPD solution just under the first layer of the skin. When done correctly, the injection forms a small bubble of fluid that looks like a blister. The site should be left uncovered and undisturbed. The site must be examined by a healthcare practitioner at 48 and/or 72 hours to see if a local skin reaction has occurred.

TSTs are ordered less frequently than IGRA tests for TB screening but may still be ordered:

On a yearly basis for those who are part of a high-risk group, either because they have a disease that weakens their immune system or because they work or live around others in high-risk groups
Prior to a person joining an at-risk population, such as healthcare workers
When someone has been in close contact with someone who has an active case of TB; this would be done a few weeks after a suspected exposure as it usually takes about 6 weeks after contact and initial infection before a positive result would be detected
When an individual has lived for an extended time in a country where TB is common
When a person has signs and symptoms of TB, such as a chronic cough that produces phlegm or sputum, sometimes with bloody streaks, fever, chills, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss
	 

A TB skin test should not be done when a person has had a previous positive reaction. Once positive, a TST reaction will usually remain positive for life and the skin reaction to subsequent tuberculin skin tests may become increasingly severe.



","



A healthcare practitioner will interpret a tuberculin skin test result by looking at the injection site on the person's forearm at 48 or 72 hours (in most cases). A positive result will form a red and swollen raised circle at the site of the injection. The size (diameter) of the swollen raised circle determines whether exposure to TB has occurred. The size that is considered positive varies with the health status and age of the individual. Even when infected, children, the elderly, and people who are severely immune compromised (such as those with AIDS) may have smaller, delayed, or even negative reactions to the TST.
A positive TST or IGRA test result means that the person is likely to have been exposed to TB and the person may have a latent or active TB infection. If a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has active tuberculosis, a history and physical examination and other tests, such as chest X-rays and AFB laboratory testing, are used to confirm the diagnosis.
A negative result means that it is likely that the person tested does not have a TB infection. However, it does not entirely rule out tuberculosis. It may mean that the person's immune system has not responded to the antigen in the test or that it is too early to detect exposure. It takes about 6 weeks after infection before a person demonstrates a positive reaction to TB screening tests. If suspicion of TB remains high and a healthcare practitioner wants to confirm a negative or indeterminate result, the practitioner may repeat the TST or do an IGRA as an alternate follow-up test.
Occasionally, a person infected with or exposed to other Mycobacterium species, for example Mycobacterium kansasii, will give a false-positive TST result for TB. Positive results must be followed up by other tests such as chest X-rays to look for signs of active TB disease. If active TB disease is suspected, AFB testing including smears and cultures and sensitivity testing, may be used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the drug susceptibility for the M. tuberculosis infecting the person.



","



Positive TST results are commonly seen in those who have received a BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccination. IGRA results are not affected by BCG.
A negative TST may cause mild itching or discomfort at the injection site. A person may not respond to a TB skin test (even with TB exposure) if the person has had a recent viral infection, a ""live"" vaccine (such as measles, mumps, chickenpox, influenza), or has overwhelming tuberculosis, another bacterial infection, or is taking immune suppressive drugs such as corticosteroids.
A person should generally wait 4-6 weeks to do a TB skin test after having had a vaccination with a live-virus vaccine.



",,"



Tuberculosis (TB) skin tests are not used as general population screens but are used to screen people who are at high risk for TB exposure, such as:

People with diseases or conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV or AIDS, which makes them more vulnerable to a TB infection
Those who are in confined living conditions such as homeless shelters, migrant farm camps, nursing homes, schools, and correctional facilities
Healthcare workers and others whose occupations bring them in close contact with those who may have active TB
People who have signs and symptoms consistent with active tuberculosis
Those who come from or have lived for a period of time in a foreign country where TB may be more common
Those who inject illegal drugs

 
Either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or a blood test called an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) may be performed to screen for TB, but in most cases the IGRA is now preferred over the TST. The IGRA test measures the release of a substance called gamma interferon by white blood cells in a sample of blood when the cells are exposed to specific TB antigens.
Recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Infectious Diseases Society, of America (IDSA), and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) list a preference for an IGRA test when:

Someone is unlikely to return to have their TST evaluated
The person is 5 years or older
Is likely to be infected with TB
Has a low to intermediate risk of progressing to active tuberculosis
A test for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is warranted
And/or if the person being tested has received the BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine that might interfere with the interpretation of a TST. BCG is not used as a vaccine in the United States, but it is often routinely administered in countries with a higher incidence of TB and it is used in the U.S. as a treatment for some cancers.

 
The TST test is considered an acceptable alternative to the IGRA if the IGRA is not available or is considered too costly or burdensome.
These same agencies do NOT recommend testing people who are not likely to be infected with TB, or those who are considered at a low risk for TB infection and disease progression.
However, when testing for latent TB infection is required, such as for employment or a legal requirement, they suggest:

An IGRA rather than a TST when someone is 5 years or older
A second test, either an IGRA or TST, when the initial test is positive and to only consider the person positive if both tests are positive
A TST rather than an IGRA when a person is less than 5 years old, healthy, and the TB screening is warranted

 
If there is a risk that the first TST is a false-negative reaction, a second skin test can be given so that the TST can have the chance to stimulate the immune system, causing a positive or boosted reaction in the second test.

None


","

To help diagnose a T-cell lymphoma; sometimes to detect and evaluate residual lymphoma cells


","

A bone marrow, tissue such as a lymph node (biopsy), or body fluid sample; sometimes a blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



This test detects characteristic changes (rearrangements) in specific genes in T-cells. This information can be helpful in diagnosing a T-cell lymphoma.
T-cells are a type of lymphocyte (a kind of white blood cell, WBC) that helps to protect the body from infection. Rearrangements in certain parts of their DNA called receptor genes are a normal part of their development. These rearrangements are associated with the development of a large repertoire of diverse T-cells, allowing them to protect against many different kinds of infections. The final order in which the genes are rearranged is called a gene rearrangement profile. Within any normal population (sample) of T-cells, the cells and their gene rearrangement profiles are very diverse.
In lymphoma, the T-cells in affected tissue (such as blood, lymph node, or skin) are identical and their gene rearrangement profiles are likewise identical. Lymphomas arise when an abnormal T-cell begins to produce numerous identical copies of itself (clones). The cloned cells grow and divide uncontrollably, crowding out normal cells.
A T-cell receptor gene rearrangement test evaluates the T-cells in a person's sample to determine whether the majority of T-cell rearrangement profiles are diverse or identical. This information, along with clinical signs and symptoms and results of other laboratory tests, can help clarify a person's diagnosis, or evaluate for persistent, residual, or recurrent lymphoma.
Most non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the U.S. are B-cell lymphomas (about 85%), according to the American Cancer Society. Close to 15% are T-cell lymphomas. There are many different types of T-cell lymphomas, but each is rare.
For additional details about T-cells and this testing, see Common Questions below.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A bone marrow, lymph node, or other tissue biopsy procedure is performed by a doctor or other trained specialist. Body fluid samples are obtained through collection of the fluid in a container by inserting a needle into the body cavity and aspirating a portion of the fluid with a syringe. Sometimes, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a healthcare practitioner thinks that you may have a T-cell lymphoma; when a healthcare practitioner would like to assess whether treatment has been effective and/or whether lymphoma has recurred


","



Testing is performed when a person has signs and symptoms that suggest a lymphoma, such as:

One or more swollen but painless lymph nodes—depending on the site of the affected lymph node, symptoms may involve areas of the chest, armpit, neck, abdomen, or groin area, for example.
Skin lesions
Enlarged spleen and/or liver
Fatigue
Fever
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Neurologic symptoms that may suggest central nervous system involvement

Findings from a CBC and differential may be the first indication that a person might have a lymphoma as symptoms may be absent, mild, or nonspecific.
Testing may be done when other laboratory tests indicate that a lymphoma may be present and/or when other tests are inconclusive. Some examples include:

An increased number of lymphocytes, especially abnormal-looking lymphocytes with similar appearance, as determined with a CBC and a blood smear examination
Signs of lymphoma in a tissue biopsy, body fluid or bone marrow sample
With immunophenotyping (e.g., flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry), antigen groupings that are inconclusive for a T-cell lymphoma, or when the healthcare practitioner wants to confirm a diagnosis of lymphoma based on histopathology and immunophenotyping

Testing may also be ordered when a person has been treated for a lymphoma to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and to detect residual or recurrent disease.



","



Results of testing are typically interpreted by a healthcare practitioner who specializes in pathology, in particular, pathology dealing with blood, blood cells, and bone marrow cells (hematopathology). Results must be interpreted in conjunction with clinical findings, other test results including histopathology, immunophenotyping information, an understanding of the strengths and limitations of different testing methods.
This testing helps confirm whether a cloned population of T-cell lymphocytes is present and helps confirm and/or clarify a person's diagnosis. In general, if a significant clonal T-cell population is detected and other associated tests are in agreement, it is likely that the individual tested has a T-cell lymphoma or that lymphoma has recurred.
Examples of lymphomas that may be detected by this testing include:

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)
Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma
Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma
Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma
Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma
Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type
Mycosis fungoides
Sézary syndrome
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified
Precursor T-cell neoplasm (T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma)
T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia

A negative result on this test does not necessarily rule out a lymphoma. A person with a negative result for a clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement may still have lymphoma. A test may also be negative if the test method is not sensitive enough to detect the rearrangement or if the clonal lymphocytes from the person tested have mutations that are not detected by the test, or if the lymphoma is of the B-cell type.



","



Testing may need to be repeated when the sample does not contain enough DNA to test or if the sample is not suitable for testing.
The detection of a clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement is not synonymous with the presence of T-cell lymphoma. An individual may have a clonal T-cell population and not have cancer. Conditions such as autoimmune disorders, certain infections, immune suppression, and immune deficiencies are sometimes associated with small clonal T-cell populations. This means that one or more groups of cloned T-cells may be present in a person's lymphocyte population without it being considered a lymphoma.
Since false-positive and false-negative results can be associated with the testing, the results must be interpreted in the context of other clinical and pathologic findings.



",,"



T-cell receptor gene rearrangement testing is used to help diagnose T-cell lymphomas and to evaluate for residual or recurrent disease after treatment.
There are many different types of T-cell lymphoma and each has different characteristics, prognosis, and likely response to therapy. Several classification systems have been used to describe them. The most recent is the World Health Organization's. (For more on this, see the Lymphoma page.)
Testing for T-cell lymphomas is done in a step-wise fashion and typically starts with:

Complete blood count (CBC) and a WBC differential to evaluate the number, types, and maturity of white blood cells present in the blood; results may reveal an increased number of lymphocytes and/or presence of abnormal lymphocytes.
A pathology evaluation of blood smear, bone marrow, lymph node, skin and/or other tissue biopsy samples is performed. These samples are examined under a microscope by a trained laboratorian, usually a pathologist.
If indicated, immunophenotyping is performed on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue (such as an enlarged lymph node or tumor) using a method such as flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. This test detects the presence or absence of certain markers on the membrane of the cells or inside the cells. These commonly used markers are called clusters of differentiation (CD) and are listed numerically. Patterns of antigens (presence or absence) can provide information as to whether the T-cells are clones (monoclonal) and can further help classify a T-cell lymphoma.

A proliferation of T-cells can be benign or malignant. If, after the above tests are performed, there is still no conclusion as to whether a person has a benign or malignant T-cell population, a T-cell receptor gene rearrangement test can be performed.
This testing may also sometimes be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of lymphoma treatment — to detect residual or recurrent disease, the continued presence of abnormal monoclonal T-cells.

testosterone,"['Total Testosterone', 'Free Testosterone', 'Bioavailable Testosterone']","

None, but the sample is typically collected in the morning.

To detect an abnormal testosterone level in males and females:

In males, to help diagnose the cause of symptoms, such as erectile dysfunction or the inability of your partner to get pregnant (infertility)
In females, to help diagnose the cause of masculine physical features (virilization), excess body hair (hirsutism), infertility, or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
In children, to help determine the cause of delayed or early (precocious) puberty, or the cause of genitals that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia)

To monitor testosterone levels in transgender individuals who are undergoing hormone therapy

","



Testosterone is the main sex hormone (androgen) in men. Although it is considered a ""male"" sex hormone, it is present in the blood of both men and women. However, testosterone levels are normally much higher in men than in women. This test measures the level of testosterone in your blood. It is measured as total testosterone, either alone or in combination with free testosterone and/or bioavailable testosterone.
Testosterone is mainly produced by the male testicles. It is also produced by the adrenal glands in both males and females and, in small amounts, by the ovaries in females.

In males, testosterone stimulates development of secondary sex characteristics, including enlargement of the penis, growth of body hair, muscle development, and a deepening voice. It is present in large amounts in males during puberty and adulthood to regulate the sex drive and maintain muscle mass.
In women, most testosterone is converted to estradiol, the main sex hormone in females.

Testosterone production is stimulated and controlled by luteinizing hormone (LH), which is made by the pituitary gland. Testosterone works within a negative feedback loop:

A low level of testosterone causes increased production of LH, which in turn stimulates testosterone production.
As the testosterone level increases, LH production decreases, which slows testosterone production.

Testosterone levels are diurnal, with the highest (peak) levels occurring in the early morning hours (about 4:00 to 8:00 am) and the lowest levels occurring in the evening (about 4:00 to 8:00 pm). Levels also increase after exercise and decrease with age.
About two-thirds of testosterone circulates in your blood bound to the protein sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and slightly less than one-third is bound to the protein albumin, the most abundant protein in the blood. A small percent (less than 4%) circulates as free (not bound to protein) testosterone. Free testosterone plus the testosterone that is bound to albumin is the testosterone that can act on target tissues. This is called bioavailable testosterone.
In many cases, measurement of total testosterone provides a healthcare practitioner with adequate information. However, in certain cases, for example when the level of SHBG is abnormal, a test for free or bioavailable testosterone may be performed as it may more accurately reflect the presence of a medical condition.

For males, when you may be infertile or are unable to get or maintain an erection
For females, when your voice is lower in quality or you have excess body hair, when you have abnormal uterine bleeding, do not menstruate (amenorrhea), or cannot get pregnant (infertility)
When a child has signs of delayed or early puberty, or has genitals that are not clearly male or female



","



In men, the test may be ordered when infertility is suspected or when you have a decreased sex drive or erectile dysfunction. Some other symptoms of low testosterone include lack of beard and body hair, very small testicles, decreased muscle mass, and development of breast tissue (gynecomastia).
In boys with delayed or slowly progressing puberty, or very early puberty, the test is often ordered with the FSH and LH tests. Although there are differences among boys as to when puberty begins, it is generally between ages 9 and 14. Testing may be ordered when these common physical signs of puberty in boys developer early or later:

Increase in muscle mass
Deepening of the voice
Growth of body hair and pubic hair
Growth of testicles and penis

In females, testosterone testing may be ordered when you have irregular or no menstrual periods (amenorrhea), are having difficulty getting pregnant, or appear to have masculine features, such as excess facial and body hair, male pattern baldness, and/or a low voice. 
In infants, testosterone testing may be ordered when the genitals are not clearly male or female.



","



Males:
The normal range for testosterone levels in men is broad and varies by stage of maturity and age. It is normal for testosterone levels to slowly decline, usually starting after age 30. This is a normal part of aging and typically doesn't cause health problems.
A low testosterone level (male hypogonadism) may be due to:

Chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, HIV, liver disease, kidney disease or autoimmune diseases
Physical injury or trauma to the testicles
Viral diseases like mumps
Chemotherapy or radiation therapy
Removal of testicles to treat cancer
Use of medications such as antidepressants or narcotic pain medications
Hypothalamic or pituitary disease
Genetic diseases that can cause decreased testosterone production in young men (e.g., Klinefelter, Kallman, and Prader-Willi syndromes) or testicular failure and infertility (e.g., myotonic dystrophy, a form of muscular dystrophy)

(For more information, see the article on Low Testosterone in Adult Men.)
Increased testosterone levels in males can indicate:

Testicular tumors
Adrenal tumors that are producing testosterone
Use of anabolic steroids, which contain synthetic testosterone
Early puberty of unknown cause in boys
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in babies and children

Females:
In women, testosterone levels are normally much lower than in males, and there are different ranges of normal for women than men. Increased testosterone levels can indicate:

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
Ovarian tumor or adrenal gland tumor
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Testosterone exposure (from physical contact with someone around them using testosterone topical products)




","



Alcoholism in males can decrease testosterone levels. Drugs, such as androgens other than testosterone, can also decrease testosterone levels.
Prostate cancer responds to androgens, so many men with advanced prostate cancer receive drugs that lower testosterone levels.
Drugs such as anticonvulsants, barbiturates, and clomiphene can cause testosterone levels to rise.



","



The testosterone test may be used, along with tests for other hormone levels, to help evaluate conditions such as:

Delayed puberty in boys
Precocious (early) puberty in boys
Decreased sex drive in men and women
Erectile dysfunction in men
Infertility in men and women
Testicular tumors in men
Hypothalamus or pituitary disorders
Development of male traits, such as excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), in girls and women
Genitals that are not clearly male or female (ambiguous genitalia) in infants

Testosterone testing may be used to monitor transgender individuals who are undergoing hormone therapy.

Theophylline and caffeine are drugs that ease breathing and stimulate respiration (methylxanthines). These tests measure the amount of theophylline or caffeine in the blood to help establish an appropriate dose, to maintain a therapeutic level, and to evaluate toxic concentrations.
Theophylline is one of several medications that may be taken by children and adults who have asthma and by adults who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is a bronchodilator and functions to relax the muscles in the lungs. Theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, in which too little theophylline is ineffective and too much can cause toxicity. Both short-acting and long-acting formulations are available for asthma treatments. Acute theophylline toxicity presents with rapid heart rate and nausea. Chronic theophylline toxicity is associated with an increased risk of seizures and abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac dysrhythmias). Both acute and chronic toxicity can be life-threatening.
Caffeine is frequently used for adults as a pain reliever (analgesic), migraine remedies, and to remain alert and/or awake. It is also the preferred medication to treat apnea in premature newborns who stop breathing. Apnea compromises the amount of oxygen available to the body. It is a common and serious condition in premature newborns that must be promptly treated and closely monitored. While both medications can reduce episodes of apnea, caffeine has fewer side effects than theophylline and, thus, a lower risk of toxicity. At very high doses, symptoms similar to those found with theophylline toxicity may be seen.
Establishing and maintaining therapeutic doses can be a challenge. Both theophylline and caffeine levels may need to be monitored because the range of concentrations in which the drugs are effective but not toxic is narrow and in some cases the dose given does not always correlate well with concentrations in the blood.
The rate at which the drugs are processed by the body (metabolized) will vary from person to person. Metabolism is decreased in both the very young and the elderly and increased in smokers. The drug levels may also be affected by underlying conditions such as pneumonia, liver disease, hypothyroidism, and by acute infection or illness. Many drugs interact and interfere with the metabolism of theophylline and caffeine. They may increase or decrease its rate of metabolism.

At the start of drug therapy and at regular intervals to monitor the drug's concentration; when indicated, to detect low or excessive (potentially toxic) concentrations


",,"



The therapeutic concentration for theophylline, when used as a bronchodilator to treat asthma, is generally considered to be 5–15 mcg/mL (28-83 micromol/L) for adults, 5–10 mcg/mL (28–55 micromol/L) for children and neonates. Levels greater than 20 mcg/mL (111 micromol/L) are considered toxic. Some people may experience significant side effects at concentrations less than 20 mcg/mL (111 micromol/L). When theophylline is used to treat apnea in premature neonates, the therapeutic range is 6-11 mcg/mL (33-61 micromol/L).
Therapeutic concentration for caffeine for the treatment of premature neonate apnea is much wider, 5-20 mcg/mL (25-103 micromol/L), while concentrations greater than 20 mcg/mL (103 micromol/L) are considered toxic, and greater than 50 mcg/mL (257 micromol/L) are considered critical values.
Low levels of theophylline and caffeine may indicate that the drug has not reached a therapeutic level for the individual tested and there is insufficient drug present to be effective.
Blood levels in the therapeutic range mean that most people will have their symptoms relieved without experiencing significant side effects. Adverse side effects and the risk of seizures increase with higher concentrations of these drugs.



","



The use of theophylline as a bronchodilator has decreased as other more effective and less toxic asthma treatments have become available. It is still in use throughout the United States but is not generally the first treatment choice.
In infants, a significant amount of the theophylline dose (8.5%) is metabolized to caffeine. This occurs to a much lesser degree in children and adults. In cases where the theophylline concentration is within the therapeutic range but the infant is showing signs of toxicity, caffeine levels should be determined. Likewise, theophylline is one of the metabolites of caffeine.

For measuring TPMT enzyme activity (TPMT phenotyping), the test must be performed prior to taking a thiopurine drug since it may affect results; for the genetic test (TPMT genotyping), no specific test preparation is needed.


","

To detect a thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) deficiency and determine your risk of developing severe side effects if treated with the class of immune-suppressing thiopurine drugs that includes azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or a swab from inside your cheek (i.e., buccal swab)


","



Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is an enzyme that breaks down (metabolizes) a class of drugs called thiopurines. These drugs are used to suppress the immune system and are prescribed to treat various immune-related conditions or blood disorders (e.g., leukemia). The activity level of the TPMT enzyme, or the genetics underlying the enzyme's activity, is tested before thiopurine drug therapy to make sure that individuals treated with the drugs can metabolize them.
Examples of thiopurines include azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine. These medications are used to treat diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders. They may also be prescribed for organ transplant recipients to help delay or prevent organ rejection. If someone's TPMT activity is too low, the person may not effectively metabolize thiopurines, which can lead to severe side effects.
About one person in every 300 is severely deficient in TPMT, and about 10% of the population in the U.S. has lower than normal levels of TPMT. Individuals in both categories are at an increased risk for thiopurine drug toxicity, which can affect the activity of the bone marrow (myelosuppression) and lead to very reduced levels of blood cells, such as red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (hematopoetic toxicity). This can lead to complications such as anemia, serious infections, and/or excessive bleeding.
These side effects can cause an individual to become severely ill and may even be life-threatening. These side effects can be avoided if TPMT testing is done before starting thiopurine treatment.
There are two ways to determine whether an individual is at risk of side effects from thiopurine therapy:

TPMT activity test (phenotype)—this method tests the activity level of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in a person's red blood cells. Depending on the enzyme activity level, a person may be prescribed a standard dose of the thiopurine drug, a reduced dose of the thiopurine drug, or a different drug other than a thiopurine.
TPMT genetic test (genotype)—an alternative test to TPMT enzyme activity level is a genetic test that can identify genetic variations in the TPMT gene. This genetic test identifies individual genetic differences associated with risk for thiopurine toxicity. Each person has two copies of the TPMT gene. Most people have two copies of ""wild type"" TPMT that produce sufficient TPMT enzyme. Approximately 10% of people have one copy of the wild-type gene and one copy of a gene variation associated with decreased TPMT (heterozygous) and intermediate enzyme activity. Approximately one in 300 individuals have two copies of TPMT with variations resulting in little or no enzyme activity (homozygous). While numerous variations can occur in TPMT, there are five variations in particular that have been proven to be associated with TPMT deficiencies. Most genetic tests look for these five variations, although depending on the method used, more variations can be detected.
	This genetic test provides information about a person's likely response to thiopurines, but it will not measure how much TPMT enzyme is actually being made by the body. There can be significant person-to-person and ethnic variability in TPMT production, even in people with the same gene variations.
	 


A third, different kind of test may be used after thiopurine treatment begins. A test that measures thiopurine breakdown products (thiopurine metabolites) may be used to monitor therapy and adjust doses. For more on this, see Common Questions below.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For both genetic and enzyme activity testing, a blood sample is taken by needle from a vein in the arm. Alternatively, for the genetic test alone, a swab of cells from the inside cheek (buccal swab) may be collected.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
For the method that measures TPMT enzyme activity, taking a thiopurine drug could lead to falsely low results, so the test should be performed prior to starting therapy. For the genetic test (TPMT genotyping), no specific test preparation is needed.

Typically, prior to thiopurine drug treatment; this is a specialized test and is not routinely ordered.


","



A healthcare practitioner will typically order a TPMT enzyme activity test or genetic test before starting a person on thiopurine drug treatment. Occasionally, a TPMT genotype test may be ordered when a person treated with a thiopurine drug experiences side effects, such as a decreased WBC count.



","



Phenotype test for TPMT

If someone has little to no detectable TPMT activity, that person is at risk of developing severe side effects to thiopurine drugs. Usually the healthcare practitioner will find an alternative drug treatment. Sometimes the healthcare practitioner may prescribe a very small dose of the thiopurine.
Low to intermediate TPMT activity also puts individuals at increased risk for toxicity. In this case, the healthcare practitioner may reduce the dose of thiopurine drug given.
If someone has normal TPMT activity, the healthcare practitioner can treat the person with a standard dose of a thiopurine drug.
	 

Genotype test for TPMT

A genetic test to detect genetic variations in the TPMT gene will help determine TPMT activity and risk for side effects from low TPMT activity.
Individuals with two ""wild type"" copies of the TPMT gene produce sufficient TPMT and have little risk of thiopurine toxicity. Most people fall into this category and can be treated with a standard dose.
People who have one normal gene and one gene variation associated with decreased TPMT (heterozygous) may produce an intermediate amount of TPMT. Approximately 30-60% of people who are heterozygous have severe side effects from standard doses of thiopurines. They will likely require reduced doses of the drug but may need to be given an alternative drug.
People with two copies of a variant TPMT gene (homozygous) and who produce little to no TPMT have 100% likelihood of developing severe bone marrow toxicity (myelosuppression) when treated with conventional doses of thiopurines. They will likely be given an alternative drug.
The genetic test usually detects the most common variants associated with TPMT deficiency. It is possible for a person to have a rare variant not detected by this test, who may subsequently experience serious side effects from treatment with a thiopurine drug.




","



Though the TPMT test is used to predict risk of bone marrow toxicity, complete blood counts (CBCs) should also be done at regular intervals to detect bone marrow toxicity during treatment with thiopurine drugs. The CBC is a common blood test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. It is often used to monitor drug treatments that are known to affect the bone marrow.
TPMT enzyme activity is measured in red blood cells, so if you have recently received a transfusion of blood, the results of this test may be inaccurate.
Besides your genetic makeup, there may be other reasons for increased risk of bone marrow toxicity (myelosuppression) from treatment with thiopurine drugs. Interactions between certain drugs can also inhibit TPMT enzyme activity. These drugs include naproxen, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, furosemide, sulfasalazine, mesalamine, olsalazine, mefenamic acid, thiazide diuretics, and benzoic acid inhibitors. TPMT inhibitors may contribute to falsely low results; people should not take these drugs for at least 48 hours prior to TPMT testing.
A few people may have high levels of TPMT activity. It is thought that this decreases the effectiveness of thiopurine therapy, and these people may be treated with an alternative drug.

The tests for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity or its underlying genetics are measured in people who are about to start treatment with a thiopurine drug. One or the other of these tests is used to identify individuals at risk of developing severe side effects from thiopurine therapy, such as suppression of the bone marrow that leads to reduced numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
Thiopurines such as azathioprine, mercaptopurine, and thioguanine are drugs that are prescribed for diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune disorders.

As part of an investigation of excessive bleeding or inappropriate blood clot formation (thrombotic episode), particularly to evaluate the level and function of fibrinogen; to detect heparin contamination


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Thrombin is an enzyme in blood that acts on the clotting factor fibrinogen to form fibrin, helping blood to clot. The thrombin time assesses the activity of fibrinogen.
When an injury occurs and bleeding begins, the body begins to form a clot at the injury site to help stop the bleeding. Small cell fragments called platelets adhere to, aggregate, and are activated at the injury site. At the same time, the coagulation cascade begins and proteins called coagulation factors, including fibrinogen, are activated. Fibrinogen is then converted by thrombin into insoluble threads called fibrin that crosslink together to form a fibrin net that adheres to the injury site. Along with the platelets adhering, this forms a stable blood clot and prevents additional blood loss, remaining in place until the injury has healed.
For a stable clot to form, there must be enough normally functioning platelets and coagulation factors. If there are dysfunctional factors or platelets, or too few of them, it can lead to bleeding episodes and/or to inappropriate blood clotting (thrombosis).
The thrombin time evaluates that part of the hemostatic process where soluble fibrinogen is changed into fibrin threads. It measures the time required for a fibrin clot to form following the addition of a standard amount of thrombin to plasma. It is affected by the level and/or function of fibrinogen and the presence of inhibitors (e.g., heparin, fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, direct thrombin inhibitor). With the addition of thrombin to the test sample, the thrombin time bypasses the rest of the coagulation factors and focuses on the function of fibrinogen.
It is now understood that blood coagulation tests are based on what happens artificially in the test setting (in vitro) and thus do not necessarily reflect what actually happens in the body (in vivo). Nevertheless, there are several laboratory tests used to evaluate specific components of the hemostasis system. (For more on this, see the explanation of the Coagulation Cascade).

When you have bleeding or thrombotic episodes, or recurrent miscarriages; when a PT and/or PTT test is prolonged, particularly if abnormal fibrinogen level or function is considered; when heparin contamination of a blood sample is suspected


","



A thrombin time may be ordered by itself or along with a combination of other tests when you have bleeding or clotting episodes, experience recurrent miscarriages, or have unexplained prolonged results on primary coagulation tests such as prothrombin time (PT) or partial thromboplastin time (PTT).
This test may be ordered when your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have a disorder associated with decreased or dysfunctional fibrinogen. However, as mentioned previously, the functional fibrinogen assay (with or without a fibrinogen antigen assay) has largely replaced thrombin time for evaluating fibrinogen.
A thrombin time may sometimes be ordered when heparin contamination of a sample is suspected or when you are receiving heparin therapy, although these uses have declined.



","



Significantly prolonged thrombin times are most commonly found when there is contamination of the blood sample by the anticoagulant heparin, direct thrombin inhibitor (such as dabigatran), and may be seen with heparin-like substances and inhibitors (e.g., fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products). Contamination can occur when you are on heparin therapy and/or when heparin is used as a periodic flushing agent to keep intravenous catheters from clotting.
A prolonged thrombin time may indicate decreased fibrinogen level (hypofibrinogenemia or afibrinogenemia) and/or abnormal fibrinogen function (dysfibrinogenemia). Conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or abnormal fibrinolysis impair fibrin formation and can also lead to a prolonged thrombin time, as can conditions such as end stage liver disease or malnutrition.
If thrombin time is abnormal, additional tests may be needed, including fibrinogen activity assay (now routinely available in clinical laboratories), fibrinogen antigen assay, and liver function tests.



","



A significant percentage of people with decreased or dysfunctional fibrinogen will have no symptoms or mild symptoms and may only be diagnosed if the abnormality is discovered during testing for another reason, or because they have unexpected or prolonged bleeding following a surgical procedure or trauma.
Fibrinogen is one of several blood factors that are called acute phase reactants. Blood levels of fibrinogen along with other acute phase reactants rise sharply with conditions causing acute tissue inflammation or damage.
Genetic molecular testing is occasionally performed on those with inherited dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, or afibrinogenemia to identify the genetic mutation responsible. Testing for this mutation may also be performed on other family members.
Some recurrent miscarriages are thought to be related to inappropriate clotting in placental blood vessels.



","



The thrombin time may sometimes be used as part of an investigation of a possible bleeding disorder or inappropriate blood clot formation (thrombotic episode), particularly to evaluate the level and function of fibrinogen.
The clotting-based functional fibrinogen assay is now routinely available in clinical laboratories and has largely replaced the need for thrombin time for evaluation of fibrinogen.
This test is very sensitive to the anticoagulant heparin. Because of this, it was once used to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy and to detect heparin contamination in a blood sample. While it is still sometimes used for these purposes, other tests and heparin neutralization procedures have largely replaced it.

","

","



Thyroglobulin (Tg) is a protein produced uniquely by your thyroid gland. This test measures the amount of thyroglobulin in the blood.
The thyroid gland produces hormones (thyroxine or T4 and triiodothyronine or T3) that help to regulate the rate at which the body uses energy. It is a small, butterfly-shaped organ that lies flat against the windpipe at the base of the throat and is composed primarily of very small, ball-shaped structures called follicles that produce and store thyroglobulin.
Thyroglobulin serves as the source of T4 and T3. The production of these hormones and their release into the bloodstream are stimulated by the pituitary hormone TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone).
Thyroglobulin is produced in all healthy individuals, and normally its level in blood is low. Thyroglobulin levels increase in both benign (Graves disease, subacute thyroiditis, Hashimoto thyroiditis) and thyroid cancer. Therefore, it is on one hand a non-specific indicator of a thyroid dysfunction and, on the other hand, a tumor marker that can be used to monitor patients with thyroid papillary and follicular cancer after diagnosis (see the Thyroid Cancer article).

","



A thyroglobulin test may be ordered prior to surgery to remove the thyroid gland for cancer. It is also ordered after the completion of treatment to help determine whether any normal and/or cancerous thyroid tissue may have been left behind. It is often ordered on a regular basis after surgery to make sure that the tumor has not come back or spread (monitor for recurrence and/or metastasis).
A thyroglobulin test may sometimes be ordered when you have symptoms of overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) and/or an enlarged thyroid gland and your healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have a thyroid disorder such as Graves disease or thyroiditis. It may be ordered at intervals when you are being treated with anti-thyroid medications (for conditions such as Graves disease) to determine how well the treatment is working.
Rarely, it may be ordered when an infant has symptoms associated with hypothyroidism.



","



Thyroglobulin is present in the blood of all healthy individuals at a low concentration.
If you have thyroid cancer and your thyroglobulin level is elevated, then it is likely that thyroglobulin can be used as a tumor marker. In monitoring for cancer recurrence, the trend over time (pattern) is more important than one particular thyroglobulin test result.

Thyroglobulin levels should be undetectable or very low after the surgical removal of the thyroid (thyroidectomy) and/or after subsequent radioactive iodine treatments, provided that you are taking your daily thyroid hormone medication (levothyroxine, T4) to prevent TSH from rising.
However, if after surgery the thyroglobulin in your blood is still detectable, there still may be either some normal or cancerous residual thyroid tissue remaining, indicating the need for imaging scans or additional treatment.
Based on the results of a thyroglobulin test, your healthcare practitioner may follow up with an ultrasound and/or a radioactive iodine scan and/or radioactive iodine treatments to identify and/or destroy any remaining normal thyroid tissue or thyroid cancer. Thyroglobulin levels are then checked again in a few weeks or months to verify the effect of the therapy and monitored periodically there afterwards.
If the level of thyroglobulin is low for a few weeks or months after surgery but then begins to rise over time while you are taking your daily dose of thyroid hormone, then the cancer is possibly recurring or spreading (metastasis), prompting your healthcare practitioner to order anatomic imaging or further treatment.

Decreasing levels of thyroglobulin in those treated for Graves disease indicate a response to treatment.



","



Increased thyroglobulin levels are not diagnostic of thyroid cancer. Cancer must be diagnosed by looking at samples of cells (biopsy) using a microscope. Elevated levels of thyroglobulin do not in themselves imply a poor prognosis. For more details, see the articles on Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules.
People who have a goiter, thyroiditis, or hyperthyroidism may have elevated thyroglobulin levels, although the test is not routinely ordered with these conditions.
If you have your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid hormone replacement (thyroxine) for the rest of your life.



","



The thyroglobulin test is primarily used as a tumor marker to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment for thyroid cancer and to monitor for recurrence. Not every thyroid cancer will produce thyroglobulin, but the most common types, the well-differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancers, frequently do, resulting in increased levels of thyroglobulin in the blood.
Thyroglobulin testing may be used, along with a TSH test, prior to thyroid cancer treatment to determine whether the cancer is producing thyroglobulin. If it is, then the test can be ordered at intervals after treatment to monitor for cancer recurrence. Several thyroglobulin levels may be ordered over a period of time (serial samples) to look at the change in levels. The change or pattern of results often provides more information than a single value.
Thyroglobulin testing is also occasionally ordered to help determine the cause of hyperthyroidism and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for conditions such as Graves disease.
Rarely, the test may be ordered to help differentiate between subacute thyroiditis and thyrotoxicosis factitia (hyperthyroidism caused by ingesting excess thyroid hormone pills) and to determine the cause of congenital hypothyroidism in newborns.

Thyroid autoantibodies are antibodies that develop when a person's immune system mistakenly targets components of the thyroid gland or thyroid proteins, leading to chronic inflammation of the thyroid (thyroiditis), tissue damage, and/or disruption of thyroid function. Laboratory tests detect the presence and measure the quantity of specific thyroid autoantibodies in the blood.
The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland that lies flat against the windpipe in the throat. The primary hormones that it produces, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are vital in helping to regulate the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism). The body uses a feedback system in which thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates the thyroid to produce T4 and T3 as needed. This system helps maintain a relatively stable amount of the thyroid hormones in the blood. When thyroid antibodies interfere with this process, they can lead to chronic conditions and autoimmune disorders associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, such as Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Thyroid antibody tests include:

Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)
Thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb)
Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHRAb), including thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and thyroid binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII)

If a pregnant woman has a known autoimmune thyroid disease (such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Graves disease) or has another autoimmune disorder and thyroid involvement is suspected, then one or more of the thyroid antibodies may be ordered early in the pregnancy and then again near the end. These tests are used to help determine whether the baby may be at risk of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid antibodies can cross the placenta and cause hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in the developing baby or newborn.
Thyroid antibody testing may also be ordered when a person with another autoimmune disorder has symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and/or when she has reproductive difficulties that a healthcare provider suspects may be associated with autoantibodies.



","



Negative test results means that thyroid autoantibodies are not present in the blood at the time of testing and may indicate that symptoms are due to a cause other than autoimmune. However, a certain percentage of people who have autoimmune thyroid disease do not have autoantibodies. If it is suspected that the autoantibodies may develop over time, as may happen with some autoimmune disorders, then repeat testing may be done at a later date.
Mild to moderately elevated levels of thyroid antibodies may be found in a variety of thyroid and autoimmune disorders, such as thyroid cancer, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, and autoimmune collagen vascular diseases.
Significantly increased concentrations most frequently indicate thyroid autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease.
In general, the presence of thyroid antibodies suggests the presence of an autoimmune thyroid disorder and the higher the level, the more likely that is. Levels of autoantibody that rise over time may be more significant than stable levels as they may indicate an increase in autoimmune disease activity. All of these antibodies, if present in a pregnant woman, can increase the risk of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in the developing baby or newborn.
If a person with thyroid cancer has thyroglobulin antibodies, they may interfere with tests for thyroglobulin levels. This may mean that the thyroglobulin test cannot be used as a tumor marker or to monitor the individual's thyroid cancer. Some methods of testing, including one called mass spectrometry, are not affected by the presence of thyroglobulin antibodies. When measured these ways, the thyroglobulin test can be used as a tumor marker, regardless of whether or not thyroglobulin antibodies are present. However, if a method is used that is affected by thyroglobulin antibodies, then the levels of the antibodies themselves can be used as a tumor marker to monitor thyroid cancer. If they stay high or drop low initially but increase over time, then it is likely that the treatment has not been effective and the cancer is continuing or recurring. If levels are falling and/or have fallen to low or undetectable levels, then it is more likely that the therapy has been effective in eradicating the cancer.
A certain percentage of people who are healthy may be positive for one or more thyroid antibodies. The prevalence of these antibodies tends to be higher in women, tends to increase with age, and for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, indicates an increased risk of developing thyroid disease in the future. If an individual with no apparent thyroid dysfunction has a thyroid antibody, the healthcare provider will track the person's health over time. While most may never experience thyroid dysfunction, a few may develop it.



","



The sensitivity and specificity of thyroid antibody testing is improving but is still not as good as health practitioners would like it to be. All of the thyroid antibody tests have changed over time. This is part of the reason that the tests have historically acquired many different names. There are also many distinct methodologies and each has different reference (normal) ranges. If someone is having several tests done at regular intervals for monitoring purposes, it is best to have test done by the same laboratory each time, using the same methodology.



",,"



Testing for thyroid antibodies, such as thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO), is primarily ordered to help diagnose an autoimmune thyroid disease and to distinguish it from other forms of thyroid dysfunction. 
One or more of the following tests may be performed to help establish a diagnosis of and/or monitor an autoimmune thyroid disorder:

Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)—the most common test for autoimmune thyroid disease; it can be detected in Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb)— this antibody targets thyroglobulin, the storage form of thyroid hormones.
Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TSHRAb)—includes two types of autoantibodies that attach to proteins in the thyroid to which TSH normally binds (TSH receptors):
	
Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) binds to receptors and promotes the production of thyroid hormones, leading to hyperthyroidism.
Thyroid binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) blocks TSH from binding to receptors, blocking production of thyroid hormones and resulting in hypothyroidism.



TBII is not routinely tested, but TSI is often used to help diagnose Graves disease.
These tests may be ordered to help investigate the cause of an enlarged thyroid (goiter) or other signs and symptoms associated with low or high thyroid hormone levels. Testing may be performed as a follow-up when other thyroid test results such as total or free T3, free T4, and/or TSH indicate thyroid dysfunction.
One or more thyroid antibody tests may also be ordered to determine if a person with an autoimmune condition is at risk of developing thyroid dysfunction. This may occur with disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or pernicious anemia.
A person who is receiving treatment for thyroid cancer may be monitored with a thyroglobulin test. In this case, the thyroglobulin antibody test is used to determine if the antibody is present in the person's blood and likely to interfere with the test to measure the thyroglobulin level.

No test preparation is needed. However, certain medications, multivitamins and supplements can interfere with the TSH test, so tell your healthcare practitioner about any prescribed or over-the-counter drugs and/or supplements that you are taking. If you take thyroid hormone as treatment for thyroid disease, it is recommended that your blood sample be drawn before you take your dose for that day. Acute illness may affect TSH test results. It is generally recommended that thyroid testing be avoided in hospitalized patients or deferred until after a person has recovered from an acute illness.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by the anterior pituitary gland, a small organ located below the brain and behind the sinus cavities. TSH stimulates the thyroid, a small butterfly-shaped gland located inside the neck in front of the windpipe, by binding to the TSH receptor to release the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) into the blood. This test measures the amount of TSH in the blood.
T4 and T3 help control the rate at which the body uses energy. Most of the hormone produced by the thyroid is T4. This hormone is relatively inactive, but it is converted into the much more active T3 in the liver and other tissues.
TSH, along with its regulatory hormone thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), which comes from the hypothalamus, is part of the feedback system that the body uses to maintain stable amounts of thyroid hormones in the blood.

When thyroid hormone levels decrease in the blood, the pituitary gland produces more TSH in response to TRH stimulation. TSH in turn stimulates the thyroid to produce and release more T4 and T3.
When thyroid hormone levels increase in the blood, the pituitary gland produces less TSH, and the thyroid produces less T4 and T3.

When all three organs (hypothalamus, pituitary and thyroid) are functioning normally, thyroid production is regulated to maintain relatively stable levels of thyroid hormones in the blood.
If the thyroid releases inappropriately large amounts of T4 and T3, the affected person may experience symptoms associated with overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), such as rapid heart rate, weight loss, nervousness, hand tremors, irritated eyes, and difficulty sleeping. Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is a chronic autoimmune disorder in which the affected person's immune system produces autoantibodies that act like TSH, bind and activate the TSH receptor, leading to the production of excessive amounts of thyroid hormone. In response, the pituitary produces less TSH, usually leading to a low level in the blood.
If there is decreased production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid (underactive thyroid or hypothyroidism), the person may experience symptoms such as weight gain, dry skin, constipation, cold intolerance, and fatigue. Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the U.S. It is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune response causes inflammation and damage to the thyroid as well as the production of autoantibodies. However, the autoantibodies do not cause the hypothyroidism. The detection of thyroid-related autoantibodies (e.g., thyroperoxidase autoantibodies and/or thyroglobulin autoantibodies) indicate that thyroid autoimmunity is present. These autoantibodies can be detected in Graves disease or Hashimoto thyroiditis. With Hashimoto thyroiditis, the thyroid produces low levels of thyroid hormone. In response, the pituitary normally produces more TSH, usually resulting in a high level in the blood.
However, the level of TSH alone does not always predict or reflect thyroid hormone levels. Some people with pituitary disease produce an abnormal form of TSH that does not function properly. They often have hypothyroidism despite having normal or even mildly elevated TSH levels.
Rarely, pituitary dysfunction may result in increased or decreased amounts of TSH. In addition to pituitary dysfunction, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism can occur if there is a problem with the hypothalamus (insufficient or excessive TRH).

When you have signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and/or an enlarged thyroid (goiter) or when you have a thyroid nodule (a small lump on the thyroid gland that may be solid or a fluid-filled cyst); when you are being treated for a thyroid disorder


","



A healthcare practitioner may order a TSH test when someone has signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism and/or when a person has an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) or thyroid nodule.
Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include:

Increased heart rate
Anxiety
Weight loss
Difficulty sleeping
Tremors in the hands
Weakness
Diarrhea (sometimes)
Light sensitivity, visual disturbances
There may be puffiness around the eyes with dryness, irritation, and, in some cases, bulging of the eyes.
Menstrual irregularity in women

Signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism may include:

Weight gain
Dry skin
Constipation
Cold intolerance
Puffy skin
Hair loss
Fatigue
Menstrual irregularity in women and/or fertility problems in women

TSH may be ordered at regular intervals when an individual is being treated for a known thyroid disorder. When a person's dose of thyroid medication is adjusted, the American Thyroid Association recommends waiting 6-8 weeks before testing the level of TSH again.



","



TSH results may be evaluated with other thyroid testing results (i.e., free T4 and sometimes total or free T3).
A high TSH result may mean that:

The person tested has an underactive thyroid gland that is not responding adequately to the stimulation of TSH due to some type of acute or chronic thyroid dysfunction; Hashimoto thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism.
A person with hypothyroidism or who has had their thyroid gland removed is receiving too little thyroid hormone replacement medication and the dose may need to be adjusted
A person with hyperthyroidism is receiving too much anti-thyroid medication and the dose needs adjusting
There is a problem with the pituitary gland, such as a tumor producing unregulated levels of TSH
A rare inherited disorder is present in which the body and/or pituitary do not respond normally to thyroid hormones, resulting in high TSH despite clinically normal thyroid function

A low TSH result may indicate:

An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism); Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism.
Excessive amounts of thyroid hormone medication taken by those who are being treated for an underactive (or removed) thyroid gland
Insufficient anti-thyroid medication in a person being treated for hyperthyroidism; however, it may take a while for TSH production to resume after successful anti-thyroid treatment. This is why the American Thyroid Association recommends monitoring this treatment with tests for thyroid hormones (free T4 and total and free T3) as well as TSH levels.
Damage to the pituitary gland that prevents it from producing adequate amounts of TSH
People with thyroid cancer may be treated with medications intended to suppress thyroid hormones, so they may have a low TSH.

Whether high or low, an abnormal TSH indicates an excess or deficiency in the amount of thyroid hormone available to the body, but it does not indicate the reason why. An abnormal TSH test result is usually followed by additional testing to investigate the cause of the increase or decrease.
The following table summarizes some examples of typical test results and their potential meaning.



Note: Laboratory results must always be correlated with the clinical findings of the patient.

1In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism is applied when the TSH level is elevated and the free T4 level is normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hypothyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hypothyroidism. However, subclinical hypothyroidism places affected adults at somewhat increased risk for an elevated LDL cholesterol level, increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and reduced mental acuity.
2In affected adults, the diagnosis of subclinical hyperthyroidism is applied when the TSH level is decreased and the free T4 level and T3 levels are normal on repeat testing over a number of weeks or months. Adults with subclinical hyperthyroidism may have few or no overt symptoms of hyperthyroidism. However, subclinical hyperthyroidism places affected persons at somewhat increased risk for atrial fibrillation and osteoporosis.



","



It is important to note that TSH, free T4, and free T3 tests are a ""snapshot"" of what is occurring within a dynamic system. An individual person's thyroid testing results may vary and may be affected by:

Increases, decreases, and changes (inherited or acquired) in the proteins that bind thyroid hormone (This is important for tests that measure total T3 but it is not likely important for free T4 and free T3 tests, which measure the thyroid hormones that are not bound to protein.)
Pregnancy
Liver disease
Systemic illness
Rarely, resistance to thyroid hormones

Illnesses not directly related to the thyroid, ""nonthyroidal illnesses,"" can affect thyroid hormones levels. In particular, the level of T3 can be low in nonthyroidal illness (NTI). Typically, the thyroid hormone levels return to normal after a person recovers from the nonthyroidal illness. Historically, this condition was referred to as ""euthyroid sick syndrome"" but that term is controversial because there is some question as to whether those affected have a thyroid gland that is functioning normally (euthyroid). Nevertheless, there is little data to support the treatment of NTI with thyroid hormone.



","



The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test is often the test of choice for initially evaluating thyroid function and/or symptoms of a thyroid disorder, including overactive or underactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism).
A TSH test is frequently ordered along with or prior to a free T4 test. Other thyroid tests that may be ordered include total or free T3 tests and thyroid antibodies (if autoimmune-related thyroid disease is suspected). TSH, free T4 and sometimes free T3 may be ordered together as a thyroid panel. Total T3 and free T3 should not both be ordered.
TSH testing may be used with free T4 and sometimes total or free T3 tests to:

Help diagnose a thyroid disorder in a person with signs and symptoms
Monitor thyroid replacement therapy in people with hypothyroidism
Monitor anti-thyroid treatment in people with hyperthyroidism
Help evaluate the function of the pituitary gland (occasionally)

At present, screening the general population for thyroid disorders is not recommended. However, expert opinions vary on this. In 2015, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for thyroid disease in asymptomatic adults.
On the other hand, guidelines released in 2012 by the American Thyroid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists summarize recommendations endorsed by several societies. They say that screening for hypothyroidism should be considered in people over the age of 60. Because the signs and symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are so similar to those seen in many common disorders, healthcare practitioners often need to rule out thyroid disease even though the patient has another problem.

TORCH is an acronym for a group of infectious diseases that can cause illness in pregnant women and may cause birth defects in their newborns. The TORCH panel is a group of blood tests that detect the presence of antibodies produced by the immune system in response to these infections. Confirmation of an active infection may require more specific tests.
The following tests make up the TORCH panel: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus.

Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can be passed from mother to baby through the placenta during pregnancy. An infection with Toxoplasma gondii can cause eye and central nervous system infections as well as brain and muscle cysts. If acquired during the pregnancy, it may result in a miscarriage or cause birth defects, though this depends on the time during the pregnancy when the infection was acquired by the mother. Toxoplasmosis is acquired by ingesting the parasite when handling the stool of infected cats, drinking unpasteurized goat's milk, and, most commonly, by eating contaminated meat.
Rubella is the virus that causes German measles. If contracted early in the pregnancy, an infant may develop heart disease, retarded growth, hearing loss, blood disorders, vision problems, or pneumonia. Problems that may develop during childhood include central nervous system disease, immune disorders, or thyroid disease.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is another viral infection that a mother may have acquired. More than half of all American adults have been infected with CMV at some point in their life and, in most cases, it does not cause severe illness. However, it may pass to a baby during the birth process and can also infect newborns through breast milk. Infected infants may have severe problems, such as hearing loss, vision problems, mental retardation, pneumonia, and seizures.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common viral infection. The two most common infections with HSV are ""cold sores"" affecting the lips and genital herpes. Both of these infections can recur. HSV is most commonly acquired through oral or genital contact. Newborns who contract the virus usually do so during travel through the birth canal of a woman who has a genital infection with HSV. The virus may spread throughout the newborn's body, attacking vital organs. Treatment with specific antiviral medication should begin as soon as possible in the infected newborn. Even if treated, surviving babies may have permanent damage to their central nervous system.

Other infections that may be tested for at the same time include syphilis, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), enterovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster virus, and parvovirus B19.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is required for the test. Blood can be collected by a heelstick from an infant or a needle is used to draw blood from a vein in a woman's arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

The TORCH panel may be ordered when an infant shows any signs or symptoms suggestive of the infections included in the panel, such as:

Exceptionally small size relative to the gestational age
Deafness
Developmental delays
Seizures
Heart defects
Cataracts
Enlarged liver or spleen
Low platelet level
Jaundice

This panel may sometimes be order prior to a woman becoming pregnant or very early in her pregnancy (first trimester).



","



Results are usually reported as positive or negative, indicating the presence or absence of antibodies for each of the infections tested for with the panel.
A ""normal"" result is negative (undetectable) antibody in the blood and means that it is unlikely that the person tested has the infection. However, if a healthcare practitioner strongly suspects that a newborn or pregnant woman has one of these infections, even though the results were negative, other tests for the suspected infection should be done.
A positive result indicates high likelihood of infection with that microbe. However, further testing must be done to confirm these results. Any positive antibody results should be confirmed with additional specific tests before the diagnosis is considered valid.



","



Use of the TORCH panel to diagnose these infections is becoming less common since more specific and sensitive tests to detect infection are available. Relying on the presence of antibodies may delay the diagnosis since it takes days to weeks for the antibodies to be produced.
Detection of the antigen or growing the microorganism in culture can be done earlier in the infectious disease process and are more specific.
Some recent studies have found questionable benefit to routine TORCH screening in newborns with certain symptoms, such as being small for gestational age, and greater benefit to using more specific methods, such as, in this example, CMV culture.

","

To screen for an allergic disease; sometimes to screen for a parasitic infection


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that is produced by the body’s immune system in response to a perceived threat. It is one of five classes of immunoglobulins (A, G, M, D, and E) and is normally present in the blood in very small amounts. This test measures the amount of IgE in the blood.
Immunoglobulins are proteins that play a key role in the body's immune system. They are produced by specific immune cells called plasma cells. Immunoglobulins are produced in response to bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms as well as substances that are recognized as ""non-self"" or present harmful antigens to the immune system.
Immunoglobulin E is associated with allergic responses, including asthma, and to a lesser degree with immunity to parasites. With allergies, the body overreacts to one or more substances in the environment called allergens that do not typically cause a response in other people. Someone may develop an allergy when that person is exposed to an allergen, such as plant pollen, peanuts, eggs, strawberries, bee venom, and hundreds of other potential substances.
During an initial exposure, also called sensitization, an allergic person produces an IgE specifically directed against that allergen. IgE binds to specialized white blood cells, resulting in the release of a number of substances, including histamine. In allergic/asthmatic people, this can cause constriction of the bronchi in the lungs. These substances are also responsible for the running nose, itchy eyes, and skin itching that occur in people with allergies.
Each time an allergic person is exposed to a specific allergen(s) after the initial exposure, IgE is rapidly produced, increasing to levels that trigger an allergic reaction. The severity of the reaction and symptoms associated with each episode can range from a localized reddening and itching of the skin, to respiratory distress, to vomiting and diarrhea, and in some cases to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Severity will vary from person to person, can vary from episode to episode, and may worsen over time.
The total IgE test measures the overall quantity of immunoglobulin E in the blood, not the amount of a specific type. It can be used to detect an allergic response in the body rather than a specific allergy. This test may compliment the information provided by allergy tests that detect allergen-specific IgE.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?

When you have periodic or persistent skin, lung, or digestive symptoms that suggest allergies; when a healthcare practitioner suspects a parasitic infection


","



A total IgE test may be ordered when a person has periodic or persistent symptoms that may be due to an allergic reaction, especially when the potential allergen is unknown. Symptoms may include those that suggest skin, respiratory, and/or digestive involvement, such as:

Periodic or persistent itching
Hives
Itchy eyes
Eczema
Nausea, vomiting, persistent diarrhea
Sneezing, coughing, congestion
Difficulty breathing
Asthma symptoms: wheezing, breathlessness, coughing, tightness in the chest

Sometimes an IgE may be ordered as a screening test when a person has persistent diarrhea that may be due to a parasitic infection. In addition, a complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential may be ordered to determine if the number of eosinophils is increased.



","



An increased total IgE level indicates that it is likely that a person has one or more allergies. Allergen-specific IgE levels will increase after an exposure and then decline over time, thus affecting the total IgE level. If a person is allergic to a seasonal substance, such as pollen, then both the specific IgE and total IgE would be expected to increase during the time of year when the allergen is present. If someone has one or more food allergies, then the total IgE level would mirror exposures to these foods. If someone is allergic to something that they are constantly around, such as mold in a house or cat dander, then the total IgE level may be persistently increased.
An elevated level of total IgE indicates an allergic process is likely present, but it will not indicate what a person is allergic to. In general, the greater the number of things a person is allergic to, the higher the total IgE level may be. An IgE elevation can also indicate the presence of a parasitic infection but cannot be used to determine the type of infection.
A normal IgE level makes it less likely that a person has allergies but does not rule them out due to the length of time between exposures. In between exposures, a person's IgE level may drop.
Sometimes an individual has a condition that affects the immune system and will not produce normal amounts of immunoglobulins. In this case, a person could have an allergy that is not reflected by the total IgE test result.



","



In order to identify specific allergies, a healthcare practitioner must order tests that detect allergen-specific IgE. If a person is suspected of having an allergy to cats, then a cat dander IgE test must be ordered. If the person actually has an allergy to dogs, it will not be detected with this test. For this reason, healthcare practitioners may screen with a total IgE test, then run panels of substance-specific IgE tests. These panels may include a range of common allergens or similar types of allergens, such as various grasses, pollen, molds, pet dander, and/or foods.
A person's symptoms during an allergic episode do not necessarily correlate with that person's total IgE level.
Infrequently, an IgE test may be ordered to help diagnose a very rare inherited disease called hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job syndrome). People with this disease often have significantly higher than normal IgE levels and may have eczema, recurrent sinus and lung infections, bone defects, and severe skin infections. A greatly increased IgE concentration may indicate that an individual has inherited this condition. Additional testing can be performed to detect a mutation in the STAT3 gene that has been associated with this disorder.
Rarely, the IgE test is used to help diagnose and monitor multiple myeloma that produces monoclonal IgE.



",,"



The total IgE test may be used to help screen for and detect allergic diseases. It measures the overall quantity of immunoglobulin E in the blood. It may be ordered by itself, before, or along with allergen-specific IgE tests, depending upon whether or not a person or healthcare practitioner has identified potential substances to which the person may be allergic.
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is an antibody that is produced by the body's immune system in response to a perceived threat. It is one of five classes of immunoglobulins and is normally present in the blood in very small amounts. IgE is associated with allergic responses, including asthma, and to a lesser degree with immunity to parasites. (For more, see the ""What is being tested?"" section.)
IgE can be increased with parasitic infections, so a total IgE test is sometimes used as a screening test if a parasitic infection is suspected.

Proteins are important building blocks of all cells and tissues. They are important for body growth, development, and health. They form the structural part of most organs and make up enzymes and hormones that regulate body functions. This test measures the amount of protein in your blood.
Two classes of proteins are found in the blood, albumin and globulin.

Albumin is made by the liver and makes up about 60% of the total protein. Albumin keeps fluid from leaking out of blood vessels, nourishes tissues, and transports hormones, vitamins, drugs, and substances like calcium throughout the body.
Globulins make up the remaining 40% of proteins in the blood. The globulins are a varied group of proteins, some produced by the liver and some by the immune system. They help fight infection and transport nutrients.

The test also compares the amount of albumin with globulin and calculates what is called the A/G ratio. A change in this ratio can provide your healthcare practitioner with a clue as to the cause of the change in protein levels.
Total protein levels in the blood may increase or decrease, to a greater or lesser degree, with various conditions.
Total protein levels may decrease in conditions that:

Interfere with production of albumin or globulin proteins, such as malnutrition or severe liver disease
Increase the breakdown or loss of protein, such as kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome)
Increase or expand the volume of plasma, the liquid part of blood (diluting the blood), such as congestive heart failure

Total protein levels may increase with conditions that cause:

Abnormally high production of protein (e.g., inflammatory disorders, multiple myeloma)
Dehydration

Malnutrition
Malabsorption such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

Some examples of conditions that cause high total protein include:

Bone marrow disorders such as multiple myeloma

Low A/G ratio may be caused by:

Overproduction of globulins, such as seen in multiple myeloma or autoimmune diseases
Underproduction of albumin, such as may occur with cirrhosis
Selective loss of albumin from the circulation, as may occur with kidney disease (nephrotic syndrome)

High A/G ratio may be caused by:

Underproduction of immunoglobulins as happens in some genetic deficiencies
Leukemias

Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Diagnosis can be made by serologic testing or by molecular testing. Serologic testing detects antibodies in the blood that are produced in response to an infection and, depending on the type of antibodies present (IgG or IgM), a current or past infection can be determined. Molecular testing such as PCR detects the genetic material (DNA) of the parasite in the blood and indicates an acute infection.
T. gondii is a parasite that cannot be seen with the naked eye (microscopic). In most healthy humans, the infection either causes no symptoms or results in a mild flu-like illness. When a pregnant woman becomes infected, however, and passes it to her unborn child, or a person with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) becomes infected, the parasite can cause severe complications.
T. gondii is widely distributed. It is found throughout the world and in some countries has infected up to 60% of the population. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 11% of those 6 years of age and older have had toxoplasmosis and that more than 40 million people carry it. The infection can be acquired by:

Eating contaminated food, especially eating raw or undercooked meat, such as pork, lamb, and venison
Eating unwashed fruits and vegetables that are grown in contaminated soil
Having contact with contaminated soil
Drinking contaminated water
Drinking unpasteurized milk
Handling contaminated cat litter
Playing in contaminated sandboxes
Transmission from mother-to-child
Rarely, transmission during an organ transplantation or blood transfusion

The main hosts for T. gondii are wild and domestic cats. When cats become infected by eating infected birds, rodents, or contaminated raw meat, T. gondii replicates and forms eggs encased in protective coverings (oocysts). During an active infection, millions of microscopic eggs may be released for several weeks into the cat's stool. The eggs become infective within a couple of days and can remain viable for several months. In all other hosts, including humans, T. gondii only goes through a limited portion of its lifecycle and then forms inactive cysts in the muscles, brain, and eyes. The host's immune system keeps these cysts dormant and protects the body against further infection. The dormant stage can persist throughout the host's life, unless the immune system becomes compromised.
An initial or re-activated Toxoplasma gondii infection can cause significant symptoms and complications in people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have HIV/AIDS, are undergoing chemotherapy, have had a recent organ transplant, or are on immunosuppressant medications. It can affect the nervous system and eyes, causing headaches, seizures, confusion, fever, encephalitis, loss of coordination, and blurred vision.
When a woman becomes infected during pregnancy, there is a 30-40% chance that the infection will be passed to her unborn child. If this congenital infection occurs early in the pregnancy, it can cause miscarriages or stillbirths or can lead to severe complications in the newborn, including mental retardation, seizures, blindness, and an enlarged liver or spleen. Many infected babies, especially those exposed later in the pregnancy, will appear normal at birth but may develop symptoms, such as severe eye infections, hearing loss, and learning disabilities, years later.

When a pregnant woman or a person with a weakened immune system has been exposed to T. gondii and/or has flu-like symptoms or a severe eye or brain infection that a healthcare practitioner suspects are due to toxoplasmosis


","



T. gondii antibody testing is not routinely ordered on pregnant women but may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine if a woman has previously had toxoplasmosis and when she has been exposed to cat feces (stool), raw or undercooked meat, or contaminated food or water. When the antibody test is negative but suspicion is still high, the test may be repeated one or more times during the pregnancy.
Antibody testing may be ordered for a person with a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) when the person has symptoms of a flu-like illness and for anyone who has symptoms or complications that suggest toxoplasmosis. Signs and symptoms of toxoplasmosis may include:

Swollen lymph nodes
Fever, night sweats
Weakness, fatigue
Headache
Body aches
Sometimes a sore throat
	 

A more serious infection that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, may cause visual and mental changes or seizures, for example.
Molecular (DNA) testing may be performed when an acute toxoplasmosis infection is suspected in an immunocompromised person or to determine if an unborn baby is infected.  Amniotic fluid may be tested during pregnancy when a mother has evidence of an acute infection as indicated by a positive Toxoplasma IgM antibody test result.



","



Care must be taken when interpreting the results of toxoplasmosis testing. An immunocompromised person may not have a strong antibody response to the T. gondii infection – their IgM and IgG levels may be lower than expected even though they have an active case of toxoplasmosis.
Antibody testing

Negative
No infection or very early infection; no previous exposure


Positive
Negative
Early infection; in a newborn, indicates congenital infection


Positive

Current infection; chronic infection; could indicate re-activation; IgM may be positive for several months after the infection resolves



False positives can occur. In most cases, positive IgM antibody tests should be confirmed by another test method, typically by sending the sample to a reference laboratory that specializes in toxoplasmosis testing.
IgM antibodies are the only class produced by an unborn baby. When Toxoplasma IgM antibodies are present in a newborn, they indicate a congenital infection.
Molecular (DNA) testing 
If the molecular test is positive for T. gondii DNA, then the person tested has an active toxoplasmosis infection. A negative test result means that it is less likely that the person has toxoplasmosis but does not rule out infection – Toxoplasma may not be present in sufficient numbers in the blood or fluid sample to be detected.



","



T. gondii infection is the most common cause of intraocular inflammation in the world. In those with complications, it can scar the retina and cause severe eye infections.



","



A toxoplasmosis test is used to detect a current or past infection with the microscopic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Most often it may be performed for:

A woman prior to or during a pregnancy to determine if she has been previously exposed to Toxoplasma gondii and during a pregnancy if exposure is suspected
An individual who has a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) and has flu-like symptoms
A person who has signs or symptoms of toxoplasmosis
An unborn baby, in which case, amniotic fluid may be tested
	 

There are several methods of testing for T. gondii. The choice of tests and samples collected depends on the person, their symptoms, and on the healthcare practitioner's clinical findings.
Serologic (Antibody) testing
When someone is exposed to T. gondii, their immune system responds by producing antibodies to the parasite. Two classes of Toxoplasma antibodies may be found in the blood: IgM and IgG.
IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the body in response to a Toxoplasma infection. They are present in most individuals within a week or two after the initial exposure. IgM antibody production rises for a short time period and declines. Eventually, sometimes months after the initial infection, the level (titer) of IgM antibody falls below a detectable level in most people. Additional IgM may be produced when dormant T. gondii is reactivated and/or when a person has a chronic infection.
IgG antibodies are produced by the body several weeks after the initial infection and provide long-term protection. Levels of IgG rise during the active infection, then stabilize as the Toxoplasma infection resolves and the parasite becomes inactive. Once a person has been exposed to T. gondii, that person will have some measurable amount of IgG antibody in their blood for the rest of their life and is considered immune (protected) from re-infection.
Antibody testing may sometimes be performed as part of a TORCH panel. TORCH is an acronym for several infections that can affect an unborn child and typically includes testing for: toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus.
Molecular (DNA) testing
Molecular testing may be performed to detect and measure T. gondii DNA in a blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or amniotic fluid sample.

trace-minerals,"['Trace Elements', 'Micronutrients', 'Microminerals', 'Essential Minerals']","

Check with your healthcare practitioner to find out if fasting is needed before your test.


","

To detect and monitor a mineral deficiency or excess; sometimes to evaluate your nutritional status


","

Trace mineral testing is usually performed on a blood sample obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes a 24-hour urine collection is obtained. Special metal-free blood or acid-washed urine containers are used to minimize the potential for sample contamination by any outside sources of minerals. Rarely, hair may be collected or a biopsy may be performed to obtain a tissue sample to evaluate mineral deficiencies, excesses, and storage that have occurred over time.


","



Trace mineral tests measure the concentration of specific minerals in a sample of blood, urine, or other body fluid or tissue. These minerals are substances that the body needs in minute amounts on a regular basis for normal functioning. They are absorbed from the diet and are used in the production of enzymes and hormones, in the regulation of glucose, and in the formation of bone, teeth, muscles, connective tissue, and blood cells. The minerals assist in the metabolism of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, promote wound healing, and are vital for the transport of oxygen throughout the body.
Trace minerals are a subset of micronutrients and essential minerals. They include:

Chromium
Copper
Fluoride (usually included but rarely tested)
Iodine
Iron
Manganese
Molybdenum
Selenium
Zinc

The World Health Organization lists iodine, iron,  and vitamin A as the most important micronutrients in terms of global public health. In the United States, deficiencies and excesses of trace minerals are less common, although iron deficiency remains a potential problem.
Examples of causes of trace mineral deficiencies include:

Not eating enough food or a variety of foods – may be caused by malnutrition or a restricted diet; sometimes seen when someone receives only intravenous nutrition.
An inability to absorb enough nutrients – may be seen with a variety of chronic conditions, such as celiac disease, and is associated with malabsorption or with surgeries that remove part of the stomach or intestines.
Inability to use – some people may not be able to properly utilize one or more trace minerals.
Increased use or need – pregnant women, children, and those recovering from an illness or injury typically have an increased requirement of nutrients.
Excess loss of nutrients – an example is the loss of iron that occurs when red blood cells are lost due to acute or chronic bleeding.
Interference – an example is the decrease in copper often associated with an excess of zinc.

Trace mineral excesses may be seen with:

Too much intake – this may occur over long periods of time (chronic), such as taking too many supplements for several months, or can happen quickly (acute), such as accidental or occupational exposure.
Decreased elimination from the body – with conditions such as kidney and liver disease, the body may not be able to remove trace minerals at a normal rate. With some inherited conditions, the body may store minerals in tissues and organs, which can cause damage. An example includes an excess of copper storage seen in Wilson disease.

","

When you have symptoms or signs of a mineral deficiency or excess; as indicated by your healthcare provider when you have a condition that affects mineral absorption, use, or storage


","



With the possible exception of an iron test, trace mineral tests are not routinely ordered. Rather, they are ordered when a mineral deficiency or excess is suspected due to a person's medical history or signs and symptoms.
Depending on the mineral(s) that are lacking, signs and symptoms may include:

Anemia
Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea
Goiter
Muscle weakness

In children, deficiencies can cause congenital abnormalities, delay growth, and affect mental development and sexual maturation.
Excess amounts of trace minerals can cause signs and symptoms associated with toxicity that may range from mild to severe, such as:

Skin rash or pigmentation
Hair loss
Seizures
Peripheral neuropathy
In severe cases, kidney or liver failure, shock, coma, or an increased risk of lung cancer

One or more tests may be ordered periodically to monitor the status of a person with an underlying condition that causes malabsorption or the excess buildup of a trace mineral.



","



In general, low concentrations of a mineral indicate a deficiency and high concentrations indicate an excess. Successful treatment for a deficiency should show increasing mineral levels and a decrease in symptoms while treatment for mineral toxicity should show decreasing mineral levels and a corresponding decrease in signs and symptoms.
Trace mineral test results must, however, be interpreted with a degree of caution. Certain treatments for excess minerals can actually increase mineral concentrations in blood and urine samples temporarily. Some minerals, such as copper and zinc, may be increased temporarily due to infection, inflammation, or pregnancy, for example. The healthcare practitioner will interpret findings in conjunction with the person's symptoms and clinical history.



","



Trace minerals are found in varying concentrations in a wide variety of foods. Some forms of minerals are more ""bioavailable"" (or better absorbed) from an animal source than from a plant source, such as heme-iron found in meats versus non-heme iron found in vegetables, grains, and beans. Minerals are also added to foods to make them more readily available, such as ""fortified"" grains and cereals, fluoridated water, and iodized salt.



",,"



Trace mineral tests are typically ordered individually to detect, evaluate, and monitor mineral deficiencies or excesses. A healthcare practitioner may select one or more tests based upon the signs and symptoms or underlying conditions the patient has.
Sometimes more than one test is ordered to detect a single deficiency or toxicity, such as copper and ceruloplasmin tests to evaluate the amount of copper in the body or a group of iron tests (iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin) with a CBC (complete blood count) to evaluate iron deficiency as a potential cause of anemia.
If a person is malnourished or has a condition associated with malabsorption, a practitioner may order several trace mineral tests for an initial evaluation, then order one or more tests periodically to monitor the person's nutritional status and/or the effectiveness of treatment.
If someone has an inherited condition that leads to excess concentrations of a mineral, or has been exposed to toxic concentrations, a test for such a mineral may be ordered to help detect and diagnose the condition. Additional tests may be ordered at intervals to monitor the person's condition.

Transferrin is the main protein in the blood that binds to iron and transports it throughout the body. A transferrin test directly measures the level in the blood. Alternatively, transferrin may be measured indirectly (or converted by calculation) so that its level is expressed as the amount of iron it is capable of binding. This is called the total iron binding capacity (TIBC).
Iron is an essential nutrient that, among other functions, is necessary for the production of healthy red blood cells (RBCs). It is a critical part of hemoglobin, the protein in RBCs that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases oxygen as blood circulates to other parts of the body. The body cannot produce iron and must absorb it from the foods we eat or from supplements.
Normally, iron is transported throughout the body by transferrin, which is produced by the liver. In healthy people, most iron is incorporated into the hemoglobin within RBCs. The remainder is stored in the tissues as ferritin or hemosiderin, with additional small amounts used for other purposes (e.g., to produce other proteins such as myoglobin and some enzymes).
The transferrin test, TIBC, UIBC, and transferrin saturation, along with other iron tests, help evaluate the amount of iron in the body by measuring several substances in the blood. These tests are often ordered at the same time and the results interpreted together to help diagnose and/or monitor iron deficiency or iron overload.

Serum iron test—measures the total amount of iron in the liquid portion of the blood, nearly all of which is bound to transferrin.
Transferrin test—directly measures the level of transferrin in the blood. The level depends upon liver function and a person's nutritional status. Transferrin is a protein that may decrease during any inflammatory process and is referred to as a negative acute phase reactant.
TIBC (total iron-binding capacity)—measures the total amount of iron that can be bound by proteins in the blood. Since transferrin is the primary iron-binding protein, the TIBC test is a good indirect measurement of transferrin availability—the amount of transferrin that is available to bind to iron. (Note: Though TIBC is a reflection of the amount of transferrin available, TIBC and transferrin are not synonymous.)
UIBC (unsaturated iron-binding capacity)—this test determines the reserve capacity of transferrin, i.e., the portion of transferrin that has not yet been saturated with iron.
Transferrin saturation— dividing the iron concentration by the TIBC produces an estimate of how many of transferrin iron-binding sites are occupied; this is called the transferrin saturation. Under normal conditions, transferrin is typically one-third saturated with iron. This means that about two-thirds of its capacity is held in reserve. (Less commonly, the iron concentration may be divided by the transferrin concentration, not the TIBC. This similar estimate is usually called the transferrin index.)
Ferritin—measures the level of ferritin, a protein made by almost all cells in response to increased iron. The ferritin level reflects the total body iron. It will be low when there is iron deficiency and high when there is an excess of iron in the body.

When the level of iron is insufficient to meet the body's needs, the level of iron in the blood drops and iron stores are depleted. This may occur because:

There is an increased need for iron, for example during pregnancy or childhood, or due to a condition that causes chronic blood loss (e.g., peptic ulcer, colon cancer)
Not enough iron is consumed (either foods or supplements)
The body is unable to absorb iron from the foods eaten in conditions such as celiac disease

Insufficient levels of circulating and stored iron may eventually lead to iron deficiency anemia (decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, smaller and paler red cells). In the early stage of iron deficiency, no physical effects are usually seen and the amount of iron stored may be significantly depleted before any signs or symptoms of iron deficiency develop. If a person is otherwise healthy and anemia develops over a long period of time, symptoms may not appear before the hemoglobin in the blood drops below the lower limit of normal.
However, as the iron deficiency progresses, symptoms eventually begin to appear. The most common symptoms of anemia include fatigue, weakness, dizziness, headaches and pale skin. Read the article on Anemia to learn more.
Conversely, too much iron can be toxic to the body. Iron storage and ferritin levels increase when more iron is absorbed than the body needs. Absorbing too much iron over time can lead to the progressive buildup of iron compounds in organs and may eventually cause their dysfunction and failure. An example of this is hemochromatosis, a rare genetic disease in which the body absorbs and builds up too much iron, even on a normal diet. Additionally, iron overload can occur when a person undergoes repeated blood transfusions.

When you have low hemoglobin and hematocrit on a complete blood count (CBC); when your healthcare practitioner suspects you may have too much iron (overload) or too little iron (deficiency) in the body

These tests may be ordered along with other iron tests when results from a routine complete blood count (CBC) show that a person's hemoglobin and hematocrit are low and their red blood cells are smaller and paler than normal (microcytic and hypochromic), suggesting iron deficiency anemia even though other clinical symptoms may not have developed yet.
Iron tests may be ordered when a person develops signs and symptoms of anemia such as:

Chronic fatigue/tiredness
Dizziness
Weakness
Headaches
Pale skin (pallor)

Testing may be ordered when iron overload is suspected. Signs and symptoms of iron overload will vary from person to person and tend to worsen over time. They are due to iron accumulation in the blood and tissues. These may include:

Joint pain
Fatigue, weakness
Weight loss
Lack of energy
Abdominal pain
Loss of sex drive

Iron deficiency
The early stage of iron deficiency is the slow depletion of iron stores. This means there is still enough iron to make red cells but the stores are being used up without adequate replacement. The serum iron level may be normal in this stage, but the ferritin level will be low.
As iron deficiency continues, all of the stored iron is used and the body tries to compensate by producing more transferrin to increase iron transport. The serum iron level continues to decrease and transferrin and TIBC and UIBC increase. As this stage progresses, fewer and smaller red blood cells are produced, eventually resulting in iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation is decreased with iron deficiency.
Iron overload
If the iron level and transferrin saturation are high, the TIBC, UIBC and ferritin are normal and the person has a clinical history consistent with iron overdose, then it is likely that the person has iron poisoning. Iron poisoning occurs when a large dose of iron is taken all at once (acute) or over a long period of time (chronic). Iron poisoning in children is almost always acute, occurring in children who ingest their parents' iron supplements. In some cases, acute iron poisoning can be fatal.
A person who has mutations in the HFE gene is diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. However, while many people who have hemochromatosis will have no symptoms for their entire life, others will start to develop symptoms such as joint pain, abdominal pain, and weakness in their 30's or 40's. Men are affected more often than women because women lose blood during their reproductive years through menstruation.
Iron overload may also occur in people who have hemosiderosis and in those who have had repeated transfusions. This may occur with sickle cell anemia, thalassemia major, or other forms of anemia. The iron from each transfused unit of blood stays in the body, eventually causing a large buildup in the tissues. Some persons with alcoholism and with chronic liver disease also develop iron overload.



","



Recent blood transfusions can affect test results as can iron injections or transfused iron. Multiple blood transfusions can sometimes lead to iron overload.
A high TIBC, UIBC, or transferrin usually indicates iron deficiency, but they are also increased in pregnancy and with the use of oral contraceptives.
A low TIBC, UIBC, or transferrin may also occur if someone has malnutrition, inflammation, liver disease, or nephrotic syndrome. However, the tests are usually not used to assess these conditions.



",,"



The transferrin, total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) or unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) test may be used along with other iron tests to assess the amount of iron circulating in the blood, the total capacity of the blood to transport iron, and the amount of stored iron in the body. Testing may also help differentiate various causes of anemia.
Iron tests are often ordered together, and the results of each can help identify iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, or too much iron in the body (overload).

","

To diagnose an infection with the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, which causes the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis


","

For men or women, the initial portion of urine stream (first-catch urine sample); or in women, a swab of fluid and cells from the vagina or cervix; or in men, a swab from the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body (urethra).


","



Trichomonas vaginalis is a single cell (protozoan) parasite that cannot be seen by the naked eye (microscopic). It causes vaginal infections in women and, in men, infections of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body, and inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis). Trichomonas testing detects the parasite in samples from the vagina or penis to diagnose an infection.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), trichomoniasis, which is caused by the infection, is one of the most common, curable sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In the U.S., an estimated 3.7 million people have the infection, but only about 30% develop any symptoms. Symptoms are more common in women than in men.
Trichomonas vaginalis is one of the most common causes of vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) in women. When they occur, symptoms include:

Itching, irritation, soreness of the vagina, or a burning sensation
Frothy, yellow-green or grey vaginal discharge
Foul-smelling vaginal discharge
Frequent urge to urinate
Possible blood-spotting from the vagina
Itching of inner thighs
Discomfort during intercourse

In men, symptoms may include:

Burning after urinating or ejaculating
Itching or irritation of the urethra
Discharge from the urethra

These symptoms may take 5 to 28 days after exposure to an infected person or longer to develop; however, once diagnosed, trichomoniasis is easily treated with prescription antibiotics. During treatment, an infected person should cease sexual activity and inform partners so that they can also be treated and prevent re-infection.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For women, a healthcare practitioner may use a swab or small brush to collect a sample of cells or secretion from the vagina during a pelvic examination. Sometimes, the sample may be obtained from the collection vial used for a Pap smear.
Urine is recommended for men, but can also be used for women. As you begin to urinate, collect the initial portion of your urine stream (first-catch) in a container provided by the healthcare practitioner or laboratory.
Sometimes for men, a healthcare practitioner may use a swab or brush to collect a sample of cells or secretion from the urethra.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When a woman has symptoms of infection, such as a foul-smelling vaginal discharge, genital itching, and/or pain during urination, or when a man has genital itching or irritation, burning after urination or ejaculation, and/or a discharge from the penis


","



A healthcare practitioner may order a test for T. vaginalis when someone complains of symptoms. For women, symptoms may include vaginal itching, burning, or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. For men, symptoms may include pain when urinating or discharge from the urethra. It is not possible to diagnose trichomoniasis based on symptoms alone.
If someone has an infection with another sexually transmitted disease (STD), the healthcare practitioner might order Trichomonas testing as well. Likewise, if results indicate that a person is infected with T. vaginalis, the person may also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea since these STDs often occur together.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that sexually active women treated for trichomoniasis be retested within 3 months due to the possibility of reinfection by an untreated partner.



","



A positive test indicates an infection with T. vaginalis that requires treatment with a course of prescription medication. If someone is infected, their sexual partner(s) should also be tested and treated as well.
A negative test means either there is no infection with T. vaginalis and symptoms are due to another cause or the parasite was not able to be detected in the sample using the test method performed. If trichomoniasis is still suspected, a different testing method may be used to confirm the result.



","



An infected person is at greater risk of getting other sexually transmitted diseases. The genital inflammation that occurs with trichomoniasis can increase a woman's susceptibility to HIV infection and to pelvic inflammatory disease.
Neonatal trichomoniasis, though rare, can occur, causing complications in the newborn.
Fecal contamination of the specimen may show a non-pathogenic organism (Pentatrichomonas hominis, formally known as Trichomonas hominis) that is similar in appearance and may be confused with T. vaginalis through direct observation. The presence of this organism does not require treatment.



",,"



The test is used to diagnose a sexually transmitted infection with the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis (T. vaginalis). Secretions from the vagina (for women) or urethra (for men) are tested by one of the following methods:

Molecular testing, direct DNA probes, or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)—NAATs are the most sensitive tests for T.vaginalis and are now considered the gold standard for diagnosing it. With some NAATs, samples collected for testing of gonorrhea and chlamydial infections can also be used to test for T. vaginalis. Most NAATs can be used with both vaginal and urine samples for women. Only some are approved for use with samples from men.

	Samples from women can be obtained during a routine gynecologic examination that includes a Pap smear. However, T. vaginalis found incidentally during a Pap smear is not considered diagnostic because false positives and false negatives may occur.

Wet prep—the sample is placed on a slide and examined under a microscope for the presence of the parasite. The wet prep is performed on secretions that are freshly obtained and examined promptly under the microscope without the aid of any special stains. This test has poor sensitivity, especially for samples from men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends following up with a more sensitive test (i.e., molecular testing or culture) when trichomoniasis is suspected but not confirmed by wet prep.
Culture—this test is very sensitive and specific but requires up to 7 days to allow sufficient numbers of the parasite to grow and be detected.
Other methods—these include the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test and a test that detects trichomonas antigens.

Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted.

","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm or from a fingerstick


","



Triglycerides are a form of fat and a major source of energy for the body. This test measures the amount of triglycerides in the blood.
Most triglycerides are found in fat (adipose) tissue, but some triglycerides circulate in the blood to provide fuel for muscles to work. After a person eats, an increased level of triglycerides is found in the blood as the body converts the energy not needed right away into fat. Triglycerides move via the blood from the gut to adipose tissue for storage. In between meals, triglycerides are released from fat tissue to be used as an energy source for the body. Most triglycerides are carried in the blood by lipoproteins called very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL).
High levels of triglycerides in the blood are associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), although the reason for this is not well understood. Certain factors can contribute to high triglyceride levels and to risk of CVD, including lack of exercise, being overweight, smoking cigarettes, consuming excess alcohol, and having medical conditions such as diabetes and kidney disease.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. Sometimes, a drop of blood is collected by puncturing the skin on a fingertip. This fingerstick sample is typically used when a lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and TG) is being measured on a portable testing device, for example, at a health fair.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Current standards recommend that testing be done when you are fasting. For 9 to 12 hours before the test, only water is permitted. Your healthcare practitioner may decide that you may be tested without fasting. Follow any instructions you are given and tell the person drawing your blood whether or not you have fasted. In addition, alcohol should not be consumed for 24 hours just before the test.

Adults
A lipid profile, which includes triglycerides, is recommended every 4 to 6 years to evaluate risk of heart disease in healthy adults. Children should have a lipid profile screening at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and once again between the ages of 17 and 21.
Testing may be ordered more frequently when people have identified risk factors for heart disease. Some risk factors for heart disease include:

Cigarette smoking
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Being physically inactive—not getting enough exercise
Age (men 45 years or older or women 55 years or older)
High blood pressure (hypertension—blood pressure of 140/90 or higher or taking high blood pressure medication)
Family history of premature heart disease (heart disease in an immediate family member—male relative under age 55 or female relative under age 65)
Pre-existing heart disease or already having had a heart attack
Diabetes or prediabetes

For diabetics, it is especially important to have triglycerides measured as part of any lipid testing since triglycerides increase significantly when blood glucose levels are not well-controlled.
Youth
Screening for high cholesterol as part of a lipid profile is recommended for children and young adults. They should be tested once between the ages of 9 and 11 and then again between the ages of 17 and 21. Earlier and more frequent screening with a lipid profile is recommended for children and youths who are at an increased risk of developing heart disease as adults. Some of the risk factors are similar to those in adults and include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight.
High-risk children should have their first cholesterol test between 2 and 8 years old, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Children younger than 2 years old are too young to be tested.
Monitoring
As part of a lipid profile, triglycerides tests may be ordered at regular intervals to evaluate the success of lipid-lowering lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, or to determine the effectiveness of drug therapy such as statins. Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend that adults taking statins have a fasting lipid profile done 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter to assure that the drug is working.



","



In general, healthy lipid levels help to maintain a healthy heart and lower the risk of heart attack or stroke. A healthcare practitioner will take into consideration the results of each component of the lipid profile as well as other risk factors to help determine a person's overall risk of heart disease, whether treatment is necessary and, if so, which treatment will best help to lower the person's risk.
In 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII) provided the guidelines for evaluating lipid levels and determining treatment. In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association issued guidelines for adults that made recommendations on who should receive cholesterol-lowing therapy. (For more details, see the Lipid Profile article).
However, use of the updated guidelines remains controversial. Many still use the older guidelines from the NCEP ATP III to evaluate lipid levels and cardiovascular disease risk:
For adults, triglyceride test results are categorized as follows:

Desirable: Less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
Borderline high: 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.7-2.2 mmol/L)
High: 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3-5.6 mmol/L)
Very high: Greater than 500 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L)

For children, teens and young adults:
From newborn to age 9

Acceptable: Less than 75 mg/dL (0.85 mmol/L)
Borderline high: 75-99 mg/dL (0.85-1.12 mmol/L)
High: Greater than 100 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L)

For ages 10-19 years

Acceptable: Less than 90 mg/dL (1.02 mmol/L)
Borderline high: 90-129 mg/dL (1.02-1.46 mmol/L)
High: Greater than 130 mg/dL (1.47 mmol/L)

For young adults older than 19

Acceptable: Less than 115 mg/dL (1.30 mmol/L)
Borderline high: 115-149 mg/dL (1.30-1.68 mmol/L)
High: Greater than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)

Note: These values are based on fasting triglyceride levels.
When triglycerides are very high (greater than 1000 mg/dL (11.30 mmol/L)), there is a risk of developing pancreatitis in children and adults. Treatment to lower triglycerides should be started as soon as possible.



","



If you are diabetic and your blood sugar (glucose) is out of control, triglycerides may be very high.
Triglycerides change dramatically in response to meals, increasing as much as 5 to 10 times higher than fasting levels just a few hours after eating. Even fasting levels vary considerably day to day. Therefore, modest changes in fasting triglycerides measured on different days are not considered to be abnormal.
Certain drugs such as corticosteroids, protease inhibitors for HIV, beta blockers, and estrogens can increase blood triglyceride levels.
There is increasing interest in measuring triglycerides in people who have not fasted. The reason is that a non-fasting sample may be more representative of the ""usual"" circulating level of triglyceride since most of the day blood lipid levels reflect post-meal (post-prandial) levels rather than fasting levels. However, it is not yet certain how to interpret non-fasting levels for evaluating risk so, at present, there is no change in the current recommendations for fasting prior to tests for lipid levels.



",,"



Blood tests for triglycerides are usually part of a lipid profile that is used to help identify an individual's risk of developing heart disease and to help make decisions about what treatment may be needed if there is borderline or high risk. As part of a lipid profile, it may be used to monitor people who have risk factors for heart disease, those who have had a heart attack, or those who are being treated for high lipid and/or high triglyceride levels.
Results of the cholesterol test and other components of the lipid profile are used along with other known risk factors of heart disease to develop a plan of treatment and follow-up. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, such as diet or exercise programs, or lipid-lowering drugs, such as statins.

","



Troponins are a group of proteins found in skeletal and heart (cardiac) muscle fibers that regulate muscular contraction. Troponin tests measure the level of cardiac-specific troponin in the blood to help detect heart injury.
There are three types of troponin proteins: troponin C, troponin T, and troponin I. Troponin C initiates contraction by binding calcium and moves troponin I so that the two proteins that pull the muscle fiber shorter can interact. Troponin T anchors the troponin complex to the muscle fiber structure. There is little or no difference in troponin C between skeletal and cardiac muscle, but the forms of troponin I and troponin T are different. Measuring the amount of cardiac-specific troponin T or troponin I in the blood can help identify individuals who have experienced damage to their heart.
Normally, troponin is present in very small to undetectable quantities in the blood. When there is damage to heart muscle cells, troponin is released into the blood. The more damage there is, the greater the concentration in the blood. Primarily, troponin tests are used to help determine if an individual has suffered a heart attack. They may also be helpful in evaluating someone for other forms of heart injury.
Many laboratories in the U.S. use high-sensitivity troponin tests since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved them in 2017. Because this version of the test is more sensitive than previous, older versions, it becomes positive sooner and may help detect heart injury and acute coronary syndrome earlier. The hs-troponin test may also be positive in people with stable angina and even in people with no symptoms. When it is elevated in these individuals, it indicates an increased risk of future heart events such as heart attacks.
When a person has a heart attack, levels of cardiac-specific troponins I and T can become elevated in the blood within 3 or 4 hours after injury and may remain elevated for 10 to 14 days.

Immediately, then followed by a series of troponin tests over several hours when you are having signs and symptoms that may be due to a heart attack, such as pain in your chest, shoulders, neck, jaw and/or shortness of breath; when your angina worsens, especially if it does not resolve with rest


","



A troponin test will usually be ordered when a person with a suspected heart attack first comes into the emergency room, followed by a series of troponin tests performed over several hours.
A heart attack may be suspected and testing done when a person has signs and symptoms such as those listed below. Note that not everyone will experience chest pain, and women are more likely than men to have sign and symptoms that are not typical.

Chest pain, discomfort and/or pressure (most common)
Rapid heart rate, skipping a beat
Shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Nausea, vomiting
Cold sweat
Lightheaded
Undue fatigue
Pain in other places: back, arm, jaw, neck, or stomach

In people with stable angina, a troponin test may be ordered when:

Symptoms worsen
Symptoms occur when a person is at rest
Symptoms are no longer eased with treatment

These are all signs that the angina is becoming unstable, which increases the risk of a heart attack or other serious heart problem in the near future.



","



A high troponin and even slight elevations may indicate some degree of damage to the heart. When a person has significantly elevated troponin levels and, in particular, a rise and/or fall in the results from a series of tests done over several hours, then it is likely that the person has had a heart attack or some other form of damage to the heart. Levels of troponin can become elevated in the blood within 3 to 6 hours after heart injury and may remain elevated for 10 to 14 days.
Increased troponin levels are not be used by themselves to diagnose or rule out a heart attack. A physical exam, clinical history, and ECG are also important. Your healthcare practitioner may also need to see whether the troponin levels from a series of tests are stably elevated or show a rise and/or fall over several hours.
In people with angina, an elevated troponin may indicate that their condition is worsening and they are at increased risk of a heart attack.
Troponin levels may also be elevated with other heart conditions such as myocarditis (heart inflammation), weakening of the heart (cardiomyopathy), or congestive heart failure, and with conditions unrelated to the heart, such as severe infections and kidney disease.
Normal troponin values in a series of measurements over several hours means that it is unlikely that a person's heart has been injured. Signs and symptoms may be due to a cause unrelated to the heart.



","



Because troponin tests measure cardiac muscle-specific troponin, the test is not affected by damage to skeletal muscles, so injections, accidents, and drugs that can damage muscle do not affect cardiac troponin levels. However, there have been some reports of increased troponin in people with skeletal muscle disease. Also, troponin may rise following strenuous exercise, although in the absence of signs and symptoms of heart disease, it is usually of no medical significance.
Very rarely, people who have a heart attack will have normal troponin levels, and some people with increased troponin levels have no apparent heart injury. Other conditions that can contribute to elevated troponin levels include renal failure and pulmonary embolism.



","



High-sensitivity troponin tests are primarily ordered to help diagnose a heart attack and rule out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms. Either a troponin I or troponin T test can be performed; usually a laboratory will offer one test or the other. The concentrations are different, but they basically provide the same information.
Troponin tests are also sometimes used to evaluate people for heart injury due to causes other than a heart attack or to distinguish signs and symptoms such as chest pain that may be due to other causes. Testing may also be done to evaluate people with angina if their signs and symptoms worsen.
Troponin tests are sometimes ordered along with other cardiac biomarkers, such as CK–MB or myoglobin. However, troponin is the preferred test for a suspected heart attack because it is more specific for heart injury than other tests (which may be elevated in the blood with skeletal muscle injury) and remain elevated for a longer period of time.

tryptase,"['Mast Cell Tryptase', 'Alpha Tryptase', 'Beta Tryptase', 'Mature Tryptase']","

No test preparation is needed, but timing of the sample soon after the beginning of symptoms can be important. Talk to your healthcare practitioner about sample timing.

To help diagnose anaphylaxis, mastocytosis (too many mast cells), or mast cell activation


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Tryptase is an enzyme that is released, along with histamine and other chemicals, from mast cells when they are activated as part of a normal immune response as well as in allergic (hypersensitivity) responses. This test measures the amount of tryptase in the blood.
Mast cells are large tissue cells found throughout the body. They are present in highest amounts in the skin, the lining of the intestine and air passages, and the bone marrow. They contain granules that store a number of chemicals, including tryptase and histamine. When mast cells are activated, they release their contents. If a person has too many mast cells (mastocytosis) and/or the cells are activated inappropriately, the chemicals that are released (especially histamine) may cause symptoms that range from moderate to life-threatening.
Normally, the level of tryptase in the blood is very low. When mast cells are activated, the level increases rapidly, rising within 15 to 30 minutes, peaking at 1 to 2 hours, and returning to normal after several hours to a couple of days. In people with severe allergies, activation of many mast cells can cause an extreme form of allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause low blood pressure, hives (blisters on the skin), severe narrowing of the air passages, and even death. Tryptase levels will be very high in people with anaphylaxis.
In some cases, tryptase levels will be high in persons with mast cell activation disorders, in which mast cells become activated without apparent allergies or other reasons.
Tryptase levels can also be significantly and persistently increased with mastocytosis, a rare group of disorders associated with an abnormal increase in the number of mast cells. These cells may accumulate in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or in organs throughout the body (systemic mastocytosis).
While cutaneous mastocytosis typically only causes skin problems (particularly hives), people with systemic mastocytosis or a mast cell activation disorder may experience anaphylaxis and its associated symptoms. These symptoms may be persistent and are related to the organs affected by mast cell accumulation. Systemic mastocytosis may progress slowly or may be aggressive, causing organ dysfunction and, in rare cases, causing a form of leukemia.

When you have symptoms such as flushing, nausea, throat swelling, or low blood pressure that may be due to a life-threatening allergic reaction; when your healthcare provider suspects that you have mastocytosis or mast cell activation


","



Tryptase is not a frequently ordered test.  Anaphylaxis is usually diagnosed without testing for tryptase, and mastocytosis is rare.
A tryptase test is sometimes ordered when you have signs and symptoms that suggest anaphylaxis, especially when the diagnosis is not clear and/or the symptoms are recurrent. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis may include:

Flushing
Swelling of the throat, face, tongue, and/or eyes
Low blood pressure
Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain
Cardiac arrhythmias
Light-headedness or dizziness
Difficulty breathing, wheezing
Itching, often with visible hives
Confusion and/or loss of consciousness

Many of these symptoms are also seen with other conditions.
This test may also be ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that you may have cutaneous or systemic mastocytosis or a mast cell activation disorder. You may have many of the same symptoms and signs as people with severe allergies but often without any specific trigger, such as exposure to a specific food (such as peanuts) or a bee sting. You may have symptoms that indicate organ involvement, such as peptic ulcers, chronic diarrhea, and joint pain. There may be enlargement of organs such as the liver, spleen, or lymph nodes. There may be skin involvement with rashes or characteristic red, blistering lesions.



","



Normal tryptase results may indicate that your symptoms are not due to mast cell activation; however, there could be a problem with sample timing. With anaphylaxis, tryptase levels typically peak about 1 to 2 hours after symptoms begin. If a sample is drawn too early or late, results may be normal.
If a histamine test is also performed, it can be compared to the tryptase levels. Histamine concentrations peak within several minutes of the onset of anaphylaxis and fall within about an hour. If the timing of sample collection was appropriate and neither the histamine or tryptase concentrations are elevated, it is unlikely that a person had anaphylaxis, but it cannot be ruled out.
Acutely elevated tryptase levels when you have symptoms of anaphylaxis indicate it as the likely diagnosis.
Persistently elevated tryptase levels when you have symptoms of mast cell activation suggest that you have mastocytosis. Additional testing is required to confirm this diagnosis. Tryptase levels are thought to correlate with mast cell ""burden"" (quantity) in those with systemic mastocytosis.



","



Mast cells contain different forms of the enzyme tryptase, called alpha (α) and beta (β) tryptase, in both inactive and active (mature) forms. Laboratory testing can be performed to measure total tryptase, which is all of the forms together, or mature tryptase. In most cases, a total tryptase is ordered, but sometimes both a total and mature tryptase may be ordered and the ratio of the two compared. As the predominant mature tryptase in the blood is usually beta tryptase, this is essentially a comparison between total tryptase and beta tryptase. Total-to-mature tryptase ratios that are less than 10 are suggestive of anaphylaxis, while ratios greater than 20 are suggestive of systemic mastocytosis.
If systemic mastocytosis is suspected, an elevated tryptase test may be followed by a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy to determine if systemic mastocytosis is present. Typically, there are increased numbers of mast cells in the bone marrow in this disease.
Tryptase can also be elevated with asthma, myelodysplastic syndrome (a type of bone marrow disorder), acute myelocytic leukemia, and with any condition that activates mast cells.
The release of tryptase from mast cells may be triggered by a wide variety of substances, but reaction to a food is thought to be the most common cause of anaphylaxis.
Anyone can have mastocytosis, but children are more frequently affected with cutaneous mastocytosis. In children, mastocytosis is more likely to be self-limited and may be transient.



","



The tryptase test is a useful indicator of mast cell activation. The tryptase test may be used:

To confirm a diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is primarily diagnosed clinically, but a total tryptase may be ordered, along with a histamine test, to help confirm anaphylaxis as the cause of someone's acute symptoms. This is especially true if the person has recurrent episodes and/or if the diagnosis is uncertain.
To help diagnose mastocytosis or a mast cell activation disorder. Mastocytosis is a rare group of disorders associated with an abnormal increase in the number of mast cells, which may accumulate in the skin (cutaneous mastocytosis) or in organs throughout the body (systemic mastocytosis).

Occasionally, a tryptase test may be performed after a person has died (postmortem) to help determine if anaphylaxis was the cause of the person's death.

","



Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are a type of therapy that targets tumor necrosis factor (TNF). TNF inhibitors are manufactured immune proteins called monoclonal antibodies (Mab for short). These monoclonal antibodies attach to TNF and limit its activity and its effect on the body. TNF inhibitor therapy is prescribed to treat autoimmune conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Tumor necrosis factor (once called tumor necrosis factor alpha) is a normal part of your immune system. It is a protein that promotes inflammation and fever when your body is fighting anything that the immune system perceives as foreign or ""non-self"", such as bacteria or viruses. Inflammation plays a role in helping the body to heal from an injury or infection. In healthy people, the immune response is regulated, so inflammation does not become excessive.
If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system fails to distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" and mistakenly targets your own cells and tissues in an autoimmune reaction. This attack can cause excess inflammation, leading to signs and symptoms that periodically flare up and die down. Some autoimmune complications are serious enough to require medical treatment and can result in progressive and/or permanent tissue damage.
TNF is typically elevated in inflammatory autoimmune disorders such as IBD and RA. TNF promotes inflammation, which can increase the severity, complications, and damage associated with these disorders. This makes TNF a good target for drug therapies to treat inflammatory autoimmune conditions.
TNF inhibitor therapy is prescribed to decrease inflammation and allow damaged tissues to heal. It can alleviate symptoms, prevent complications, and help autoimmune disorders go into remission. TNF inhibitor therapy is primarily used when you have an active inflammatory autoimmune disorder, with moderate to severe symptoms, that is not responding well to other treatments. TNF inhibitor therapy usually involves an initial series of infusions (into your vein) or injections (under your skin), and then periodic infusions or injections every few weeks.
TNF inhibitors may be used to treat conditions such as:

IBD (which includes Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis)
RA
Psoriatic arthritis
Ankylosing spondylitis
Plaque psoriasis

The first TNF inhibitor to be developed was infliximab, about 20 years ago. It is still being used, but other TNF inhibitors have been introduced, such as:

Adalimumab
Certolizumab
Golimumab

Not everyone is helped by TNF inhibitor therapy. As many as 30% of people will not respond at all (primary nonresponse). Up to 50% will need to discontinue therapy, either because they initially respond but then stop (secondary nonresponse) or because they have adverse events.
Nonresponse to therapy is thought to be caused by a variety of factors, including:

There is not enough medication in your body to sustain a response. This can happen because the dose was not large enough or your body cleared the drug too quickly. This can occur both initially and after you have been receiving the medication for a while.
Your body develops antibodies against the TNF inhibitor (TNF inhibitor antibodies). This can occur at any time after the few weeks of starting therapy. The TNF inhibitor antibodies can make TNF inhibitor therapy less effective, for example by blocking the drug from binding to TNF. TNF inhibitor antibodies may be present in low levels that some studies suggest can be overcome by giving a higher dose of TNF inhibitor, or they may be present in sufficient quantity to prevent TNF inhibitor therapy from being effective.
No identified cause—the TNF inhibitor therapy is not effective for your condition, even if there is enough drug present and no TNF inhibitor antibody.

Because some people do not respond to TNF inhibitor therapy, testing may be performed to determine the cause. This testing can include two separate tests:

One test measures the level or activity of the TNF inhibitor that you are receiving to help determine whether the dose is adequate.
Another test detects and measures the quantity or neutralizing ability of the TNF inhibitor antibodies that may have developed and that make the treatment less effective.

There are two ways the tests can be ordered. One way is that both tests can be done at the same time. The other way is the TNF inhibitor level or activity is measured first and then the TNF inhibitor antibody test is only performed if the TNF inhibitor level or activity is low (but not if it is high).
TNF inhibitor testing is considered therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) because it can help to tailor your dose, to ensure the medication is in your body long enough at a level that is effective in treating your condition.

TNF inhibitor testing is ordered when you experience a flare up of your autoimmune condition or you are failing to respond to TNF inhibitor therapy. Testing is typically done just before your next dose, when the level of the therapy should be at its lowest. This is called a trough level.
If testing leads to an adjustment of your dose, then the test may be ordered again to recheck TNF inhibitor levels or activity on the new dose.
Testing may sometimes be ordered when you have a partial response to the start of therapy, when you have an adverse reaction to the TNF inhibitor infusion or injection, and sometimes with a primary nonresponse (you do not respond to the drug when first introduced).

Uric acid is produced by the breakdown of purines. Purines are nitrogen-containing compounds found in the cells of the body, including our DNA. This test measures the level of uric acid in the blood or urine.
As cells get old and die, they break down, releasing purines into the blood. To a lesser extent, purines may come from the digestion of certain foods, such as liver, anchovies, mackerel, dried beans and peas and certain alcoholic drinks, primarily beer. Most uric acid is removed from the body by the kidneys and is eliminated from the body in the urine, with the remainder eliminated in the stool.
If too much uric acid is produced or not enough is removed, it can accumulate in the body, causing increased levels in the blood (hyperuricemia). The presence of excess uric acid can cause gout, a condition characterized by inflammation of the joints due to the formation of uric acid crystals in the joint (synovial) fluid. Excess uric acid can also be deposited in tissues such as the kidney, leading to kidney stones or kidney failure.
The build-up of too much uric acid in the body can be due to producing too much, not eliminating enough, or a combination of both. Elevated levels of uric acid can occur when there is an increase in cell death, as seen with some cancer therapies or, rarely, as an inherited tendency to produce too much uric acid. Decreased elimination of uric acid is often a result of impaired kidney function due to kidney disease.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. A 24-hour urine sample may be collected for the urine uric acid test.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation may be needed. Some institutions, however, recommend fasting for 4 or more hours. Follow any instructions provided and be sure to discuss with your healthcare practitioner any medications you take before having this test performed.

When you have joint pain or other symptoms that your healthcare practitioner suspects may be due to gout; when you have had or are going to have certain chemotherapy or radiation therapies for cancer; when you have recurrent kidney stones; when you have gout or are otherwise at risk for kidney stone formation


","



The uric acid blood test is ordered when a healthcare practitioner suspects that someone has a high uric acid level. Some people with high levels of uric acid have a disease called gout, which is a common form of arthritis. People with gout suffer from joint pain, most often in their toes, but in other joints as well. The test is also ordered when cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy to ensure that uric acid levels do not get dangerously high.
The urine uric acid test may be ordered when a person suffers from recurrent kidney stones or has gout and needs to be monitored for formation of these stones.



","



Blood
Higher than normal uric acid levels in the blood is called hyperuricemia and can be caused by producing too much uric acid in the body or the inability of the kidneys to adequately remove enough uric acid from the body. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the overproduction or decreased elimination of uric acid.
There are several genetic inborn errors that affect the break-down of purines. Cancer that has spread from its original location (metastatic), multiple myeloma, leukemias, and cancer chemotherapy can cause increased production of uric acid. Chronic renal disease, acidosis, toxemia of pregnancy, and alcoholism can cause decreased elimination of uric acid.
Increased concentrations of uric acid can cause crystals to form in the joints, which can lead to the joint inflammation and pain characteristic of gout. Uric acid can also form crystals or kidney stones that can damage the kidneys.
The American College of Rheumatology published guidelines on the management of gout in 2012 that recommend that target serum urate (uric acid) levels should be below 6 mg/dL for people diagnosed with the condition.
Low levels of uric acid in the blood are seen much less commonly than high levels and are seldom considered cause for concern. Although low values can be associated with some kinds of liver or kidney diseases, Fanconi syndrome, exposure to toxic compounds, and rarely as the result of an inherited metabolic defect (e.g., Wilson disease), these conditions are typically identified by other tests and symptoms and not by an isolated low uric acid result.
Urine
High uric acid levels in the urine are seen with gout, multiple myeloma, metastatic cancer, leukemia, and a diet high in purines. Those at risk of kidney stones who have high uric acid levels in their urine may be given medication to prevent stone formation.
Low urine uric acid levels may be seen with kidney disease, chronic alcohol use, and lead poisoning.



","



Many drugs can increase or decrease the level of uric acid. In particular, diuretic drugs like thiazide drugs can cause uric acid levels to go up.
Aspirin and other salicylates have varying effects on uric acid. At low aspirin levels (as may occur in persons taking aspirin only occasionally), aspirin can increase blood uric acid. On the other hand, in high doses (as may be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis), aspirin actually lowers the concentration of uric acid.
For people who have uric acid kidney stones or gout, foods that are high in purine content should be avoided, including organ meats (like liver and kidneys), sardines and anchovies. Alcohol also should be avoided because it slows down the removal of uric acid from the body. Fasting, rapid weight loss, stress, and strenuous exercise all raise uric acid levels.
Although the uric acid test cannot definitively diagnose gout, a test for monosodium urate in synovial fluid (joint fluid) can.
Some people may have a high level of uric acid in the blood without having associated signs or symptoms (asymptomatic hyperuricemia). However, general screening to detect this condition is not recommended, nor is treatment considered appropriate.

The test is also used to monitor uric acid levels in people undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer.

One to two ounces of urine—a sufficient sample is required for accurate results; sometimes you may be directed to collect a sample using a ""clean-catch"" technique: women should spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back; men should wipe the tip of the penis. Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, then collect one to two ounces of urine in the container provided, then void the rest into the toilet.


","



A urinalysis is a group of physical, chemical, and microscopic tests. The tests detect and/or measure several substances in the urine, such as byproducts of normal and abnormal metabolism, cells, cellular fragments, and bacteria.
Urine is produced by the kidneys, two fist-sized organs located on either side of the spine at the bottom of the ribcage. The kidneys filter wastes out of the blood, help regulate the amount of water in the body, and conserve proteins, electrolytes, and other compounds that the body can reuse. Anything that is not needed is eliminated in the urine, traveling from the kidneys through ureters to the bladder and then through the urethra and out of the body. Urine is generally yellow and relatively clear, but each time a person urinates, the color, quantity, concentration, and content of the urine will be slightly different because of varying constituents.
Many disorders may be detected in their early stages by identifying substances that are not normally present in the urine and/or by measuring abnormal levels of certain substances. Some examples include glucose, protein, bilirubin, red blood cells, white blood cells, crystals, and bacteria. They may be present because:

There is an elevated level of the substance in the blood and the body responds by trying to eliminate the excess in the urine.
Kidney disease is present.
There is a urinary tract infection present, as in the case of bacteria and white blood cells.

A complete urinalysis consists of three distinct testing phases:

Visual examination, which evaluates the urine's color and clarity
Chemical examination, which tests chemically for about 9 substances that provide valuable information about health and disease and determines the concentration of the urine
Microscopic examination, which identifies and counts the type of cells, casts, crystals, and other components such as bacteria and mucus that can be present in urine

See below for details on each of these examinations.
A microscopic examination is typically performed when there is an abnormal finding on the visual or chemical examination, or if a healthcare practitioner specifically orders it.
Abnormal findings on a urinalysis may prompt repeat testing to see if the results are still abnormal and/or may be followed by additional urine and blood tests to help establish a diagnosis.
How is the sample collected for testing?
One to two ounces of urine is collected in a clean container. A sufficient sample is required for accurate results.
Urine for a urinalysis can be collected at any time. In some cases, a first morning sample may be requested because it is more concentrated and more likely to detect abnormalities.
Sometimes, you may be asked to collect a ""clean-catch"" urine sample. For this, it is important to clean the genital area before collecting the urine. Bacteria and cells from the surrounding skin can contaminate the sample and interfere with the interpretation of test results. With women, menstrual blood and vaginal secretions can also be a source of contamination. Women should spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back; men should wipe the tip of the penis. Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, then collect one to two ounces of urine in the container provided, then void the rest into the toilet.
A urine sample will only be useful for a urinalysis if taken to the healthcare provider's office or laboratory for processing within a short period of time. If it will be longer than an hour between collection and transport time, then the urine should be refrigerated or a preservative may be added.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No advance test preparation is needed.

When you have symptoms, such as abdominal pain, back pain, frequent or painful urination; sometimes as part of a health examination, pregnancy check-up, hospital admission, or pre-surgical work-up


","



A urinalysis may sometimes be ordered when a person has a routine wellness exam, is admitted to the hospital, or will undergo surgery, or when a woman has a pregnancy checkup.
A urinalysis will likely be ordered when a person sees a healthcare practitioner complaining of symptoms of a urinary tract infection or other urinary system problem, such as kidney disease. Some signs and symptoms may include:

Abdominal pain
Back pain
Painful or frequent urination
Blood in the urine

Testing may also be ordered at regular intervals when monitoring certain conditions over time.



","



Urinalysis results can have many interpretations. Abnormal findings are a warning that something may be wrong and should be evaluated further. A healthcare practitioner must correlate the urinalysis results with a person's symptoms and clinical findings and search for the causes of abnormal findings with other targeted tests, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), renal panel, liver panel, or urine culture (for urinary tract infection).
Generally, the greater the concentration of the atypical substance, such as greatly increased amounts of glucose, protein, or red blood cells, the more likely it is that there is a problem that needs to be addressed. However, the results do not tell the healthcare practitioner exactly what the cause of the finding is or whether it is a temporary or chronic condition.
A normal urinalysis does not guarantee that there is no illness. Some people will not release elevated amounts of a substance early in a disease process, and some will release them sporadically during the day, which means that they may be missed by a single urine sample. In very dilute urine, small quantities of chemicals may be undetectable.
For additional details on what specific results may mean, see the sections below on:

Visual examination
Chemical examination
Microscopic examination

There are many factors that can affect or interfere with the tests that comprise a urinalysis. If instructed to do so, it is important to follow the directions carefully for a ""clean-catch"" sample. Give a complete history to your healthcare practitioner, including any prescribed or over-the-counter medications or supplements you may be taking. If you are a women, be sure to tell your healthcare practitioner whether you are menstruating.

The urinalysis is a set of screening tests that can detect some common diseases. It may be used to screen for and/or help diagnose conditions such as a urinary tract infections, kidney disorders, liver problems, diabetes or other metabolic conditions, to name a few.
A urinalysis is comprised of several chemical, microscopic and visual examinations used to detect cells, cell fragments and substances such as crystals or casts in the urine associated with the various conditions listed above. It can detect abnormalities that might require follow-up investigation and additional testing. Often, substances such as protein or glucose will begin to appear in the urine before people are aware that they may have a problem.
In people diagnosed with diseases or conditions, such as kidney disease or diabetes, the urinalysis may be used in conjunction with other tests, such as urine albumin, to follow treatment.

To screen for and detect early kidney disease in people with diabetes or other risk factors, such as high blood pressure (hypertension)


","

A random sample of urine, a timed urine sample (such as 4 hours or overnight), or a complete 24-hour urine sample is collected in a clean container. Your healthcare practitioner or laboratory will provide a container and instructions for properly collecting the sample that is needed.


","



Albumin is a major protein normally present in blood, but virtually no albumin is present in the urine when the kidneys are functioning properly. However, albumin may be detected in the urine even in the early stages of kidney disease. The urine albumin test (formerly called microalbumin) detects and measures the amount of albumin in the urine to screen for kidney disease.
Most of the time, tests for albumin and creatinine are done on a urine sample collected randomly (not timed) and an albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) is calculated. This is done to provide a more accurate indication of the how much albumin is being released into the urine. Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally released into the urine at a constant rate and its level in the urine is an indication of the urine concentration. This property of creatinine allows its measurement to be used to correct for urine concentration when measuring albumin in a random urine sample.
The presence of a small amount of albumin in the urine may be an early indicator of kidney disease. A small amount of albumin in the urine is sometimes referred to as urine microalbumin or microalbuminuria. ""Microalbuminuria"" is slowly being replaced with the term ""albuminuria,"" which refers to any elevation of albumin in the urine.
Plasma, the liquid portion of blood, contains many different proteins, including albumin. One of the many functions of the kidneys is to conserve plasma proteins so that they are not released along with waste products when urine is produced. There are two mechanisms that normally prevent protein from passing into urine:

Specialized structures in the kidney called glomeruli are composed of loops of specialized capillaries that filter the blood, allowing small substances to pass through towards the urine, but provide a barrier that keeps most large plasma proteins inside the blood vessels.
The smaller proteins that do get through are almost entirely reabsorbed by tubes (tubules) that have a number of sections that collect the fluid and molecules that pass through the glomeruli.

Protein in the urine (proteinuria) most often occurs when either the glomeruli or tubules in the kidney are damaged. Inflammation and/or scarring of the glomeruli can allow increasing amounts of protein to leak into the urine. Damage to the tubules can prevent protein from being reabsorbed.
If a person's kidneys become damaged or diseased, they begin to lose their ability to conserve albumin and other proteins. This is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, with increasing amounts of protein in the urine reflecting increasing kidney dysfunction.
Albumin is one of the first proteins to be detected in the urine with kidney damage. People who have consistently detectable small amounts of albumin in their urine (albuminuria) have an increased risk of developing progressive kidney failure and cardiovascular disease in the future.

Once a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is made and then annually; 5 years after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and then annually; at regular intervals when you have high blood pressure


","



According to the American Diabetes Association and National Kidney Foundation, everyone with type 1 diabetes should get tested starting 5 years after onset of the disease and then annually, and all those with type 2 diabetes should get tested starting at the time of diagnosis and then annually. If albumin in the urine (albuminuria) is detected, it should be confirmed by retesting twice within a 3-6 month period. People with hypertension may be tested at regular intervals, with the frequency determined by their healthcare practitioner.



","



If albumin in undetectable in the urine, it is an indication that kidney function is normal.
Moderately increased albumin levels found in both initial and repeat urine tests indicate that a person is likely to have early kidney disease. Very high levels are an indication that kidney disease is present in a more severe form. 
The presence of blood in the urine, a urinary tract infection, vigorous exercise, and other acute illnesses may cause a positive test result that is not related to kidney disease. Testing should be repeated after these conditions have resolved.



","



Studies have shown that elevated levels of urinary albumin in people with diabetes or hypertension are associated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). More recently, research has been focused on trying to determine if increased levels of albumin in the urine are also indicative of CVD risk in those who do not have diabetes or high blood pressure. There is currently some evidence that albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of death in adults.



","



A urine albumin test and albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) are used to screen for kidney disease in people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure (hypertension). It can detect small amounts of albumin that escape from the blood through the kidneys into the urine several years before significant kidney damage becomes apparent. Studies have shown that identifying individuals in the very early stages of kidney disease helps people and healthcare providers adjust treatment. Controlling diabetes and hypertension by maintaining tight glycemic control and reducing blood pressure delay or prevent the progression of kidney disease.
If albumin is detected in a urine sample collected at random, over 4 hours, or overnight, the test may be repeated and/or confirmed with urine that is collected over a 24-hour period (24-hour urine).
For urine samples collected randomly (not timed), both albumin and creatinine usually are measured and an albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) is calculated. This is done to provide a more accurate indication of the how much albumin is being released into the urine. The American Diabetes Association has stated a preference for the ACR for screening for albuminuria indicating early kidney disease. Since the amount of albumin in the urine can vary considerably, an elevated ACR should be repeated twice within 3 to 6 months to confirm the diagnosis.

To diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI)


","

A few ounces of urine; the mid-stream clean catch urine sample is the most common type of sample collected. (The genital area is cleaned before collecting your urine.) Urine may also be collected using a catheter and, rarely, a needle is used to aspirate urine directly from the bladder. For infants, a collection bag may be attached to the genital area to catch any urine produced. For additional details, see ""What is being tested?"" below.


","



Urine is the fluid produced by the kidneys that carries water and wastes through the urinary tract and then is eliminated from the body. The urine culture is a test that detects and identifies bacteria and yeast in the urine, which may be causing a urinary tract infection (UTI).
The kidneys, a pair of bean-shaped organs located at the bottom of the ribcage in the right and left sides of the back, filter wastes out of the blood and produce urine, the yellow fluid that carries wastes out of the body. Urine travels through tubes called ureters from the kidneys to the bladder, where it is stored temporarily, and then through the urethra as it is voided. Urine contains low levels of microbes, such as bacteria or, yeast which move from the skin into the urinary tract and grow and multiply, causing a urinary tract infection.
Most UTIs are considered uncomplicated and are easily treated. However, if they are not addressed, the infection may spread from the bladder and ureters into the kidneys. A kidney infection is more dangerous and can lead to permanent kidney damage. In some cases, an untreated urinary tract infection may spread to the bloodstream (septicemia) and cause sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
Women and girls get urinary tract infections more often than men and boys. Even preteen girls may have frequent UTIs. For men and boys with a UTI confirmed by a urine culture, further tests may be done to rule out the presence of a kidney stone or structural abnormality that could cause the infection.
People with kidney disease or with other conditions that affect the kidneys, such as diabetes or kidney stones, and people with weakened immune systems may be more prone to frequent, repeated and/or complicated UTIs.

For a urine culture, a small sample of urine is placed on one or more agar plates (a thin layer of a nutrient media) and incubated at body temperature. Any bacteria or yeast that are present in the urine sample grow over the next 24 to 48 hours.
A laboratory professional studies the colonies on the agar plate, counting the total number and determining how many types have grown. The size, shape, and color of these colonies help to identify which bacteria are present, and the number of colonies indicates the quantity of bacteria originally present in the urine sample. The quantity can differentiate between normal levels of bacteria versus infection.
Ideally, if a good clean catch sample was collected for the test, only bacteria causing a UTI are present. Typically, this will be a single type of bacteria that will be present in relatively large numbers.
Sometimes, more than one type of bacteria will be present. This may be due to an infection that involves more than one pathogen; however, it is more likely due to skin, vaginal, or fecal contamination picked up during the urine collection.
The laboratorian will take a colony from each type and perform other tests, such as a gram stain, to identify the type (species) of bacteria or other microbe (i.e., yeast). Susceptibility testing may be done to determine which antibiotics will likely cure the infection.

If there is no or little growth on the agar after 24 to 48 hours of incubation, the urine culture is considered negative and the culture is complete, suggesting an infection is not present.
How is the sample collected for testing?
Although there are several types of urine samples, the mid-stream clean catch is the type most commonly submitted for culture.

It is important to first clean the genital area before collecting your urine because of the potential to contaminate the urine with bacteria and cells from the surrounding skin during collection (particularly in women).
Start first by washing your hands.
Women should then spread the labia of the vagina and clean from front to back using a wipe provided by your healthcare practitioner or the laboratory. It is recommended to repeat with a second towel or wipe.
Men should wipe the tip of the penis.
Start to urinate, let some urine fall into the toilet, and then collect one to two ounces of urine directly into the sterile container provided, then void the rest into the toilet. Do not allow the inside of the container to come into contact with skin and do not scoop the urine from the toilet (or any other container).

For catheterized specimens, a urine sample is taken by inserting a thin flexible tube or catheter through the urethra into the bladder. This is performed by a trained healthcare practitioner. The urine is collected in a sterile container at the other end of the tube. Rarely, a needle and syringe may be used to collect by aspirating urine directly from the bladder. For infants, a collection bag may be placed on the genital area to collect any urine produced.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Generally, no preparation is needed, but depending on the type of culture, you may be given special instructions. For example, you may be asked not to urinate for at least one hour before the test and/or to drink a glass of water 15-20 minutes before sample collection. This will help to ensure that you can produce enough urine for the test. Sometimes you may be instructed to collect the first urine you void in the morning. Antibiotics taken prior to the test may affect your results. Tell your healthcare practitioner if you have taken antibiotics recently.

When you experience symptoms of a UTI, such as frequent and painful urination, and/or when a urinalysis indicates you may have a UTI


","



A urine culture may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) and/or results of a urinalysis show that you may have a UTI.
Some signs and symptoms of a UTI include:

A strong, frequent urge to urinate, even when you have just gone and there is little urine voided
Pain and/or a burning sensation during urination
Cloudy, strong-smelling urine
Lower back pain

You may also have pressure in the lower abdomen and small amounts of blood in the urine. If the UTI is more severe and/or has spread into the kidneys, it may cause flank pain, high fever, shaking, chills, nausea or vomiting.
Sometimes, antibiotics may be prescribed without requiring a urine culture for young women with signs and symptoms of a UTI and who have an uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection. If there is suspicion of a complicated infection or symptoms do not respond to initial therapy, then a culture of the urine is recommended.
Pregnant women without any symptoms are recommended to be screened with a urine culture early in their pregnancy (e.g., during the second trimester) or during the first prenatal visit for bacteria in their urine.



","



Results of a urine culture are often interpreted in conjunction with the results of a urinalysis and with regard to how the sample was collected and whether symptoms are present. Since some urine samples have the potential to be contaminated with bacteria normally found on the skin (normal flora), care must be taken with interpreting some culture results.
Positive urine culture: Typically, the presence of a single type of bacteria growing at high colony counts is considered a positive urine culture.

For clean catch samples that have been properly collected, cultures with greater than 100,000 colony forming units (CFU)/milliliter of one type of bacteria usually indicate infection.
In some cases, however, there may not be a significantly high number of bacteria even though an infection is present. Sometimes lower numbers (1,000 up to 100,000 CFU/mL) may indicate infection, especially if symptoms are present.
Likewise, for samples collected using a technique that minimizes contamination, such as a sample collected with a catheter, results of 1,000 to 100,000 CFU/mL may be considered significant.

Results from a urinalysis can be used to help interpret results of a urine culture. For example, a positive leukocyte esterase (a marker of white blood cells) and nitrite (a marker for bacteria) help confirm a UTI.
If a culture is positive, susceptibility testing may be performed to guide treatment. (See the article on Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing for more details on results.)
Although a variety of bacteria can cause UTIs, most are due to Escherichia coli (E. coli), bacteria that are common in the digestive tract and routinely found in stool.
Other bacteria that commonly cause UTIs include:

Proteus
Klebsiella 
Enterobacter
Staphylococcus
Acinetobacter

Occasionally, a UTI may be due to a yeast, such as Candida albicans.
Negative urine culture: A culture that is reported as ""no growth in 24 or 48 hours"" usually indicates that there is no infection. If the symptoms persist, however, a urine culture may be repeated on another sample to look for the presence of bacteria at lower colony counts or other microorganisms that may cause these symptoms. The presence of white blood cells and low numbers of microorganisms in the urine of a symptomatic person is a condition known as acute urethral syndrome.
Contamination: If a culture shows growth of several different types of bacteria, then it is likely that the growth is due to contamination. This is especially true in voided urine samples if the organisms present include Lactobacillus and/or other common nonpathogenic vaginal bacteria in women. If the symptoms persist, the healthcare practitioner may request a repeat culture on a sample that is more carefully collected. However, if one type of bacteria is present in significantly higher colony counts than the others, for example, 100,000 CFUs/mL versus 1,000 CFUs/mL, then additional testing may be done to identify the predominant bacteria.



","



If you have frequent and/or recurrent UTIs, culture and susceptibility testing may be performed with each infection. If you have frequent UTIs, careful selection of antibiotics and completing the full course of treatment can be important.



","



The urine culture is used, along with results from a urinalysis, to diagnose a urinary tract infection (UTI) and to identify the bacteria or yeast causing the infection. If a urine culture is positive, susceptibility testing may be done to determine which antibiotics will inhibit the growth of the microbe causing the infection. The results will help a healthcare practitioner determine which drugs are likely to be most effective in treating your infection.
A urine culture is used, as recommended by several health organizations, to screen pregnant women for asymptomatic bacteriuria, a condition in which significant amounts of bacteria are in the urine but do not cause symptoms. About 2%-10% of pregnant women in the U.S. have this condition that can lead to more serious kidney infection as well as increased risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight.

To help diagnose or rule out a rare tumor of the adrenal gland called a pheochromocytoma or a rare tumor outside the adrenal glands called a paraganglioma; these tumors (PPGL) produce excess catecholamines, which are broken down to metanephrines.


","

A 24-hour urine collection


","



Metanephrine and normetanephrine are breakdown products (metabolites) of the catecholamines epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. This test measures the amounts of metanephrine and normetanephrine that are released into the urine over a 24-hour period.
Catecholamines are produced by the adrenal glands (as hormones), small triangular organs located on top of each kidney, and by cells of the sympathetic nervous system (called neurotransmitter substances or neurotransmitters). The primary catecholamines are dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Catecholamines are released in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate small air passages in the lungs called bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, which increases blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and the rate at which the body uses energy (metabolism).
After completing their actions, the catecholamines are broken down to form inactive compounds. Epinephrine breaks down into metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and norepinephrine becomes normetanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine.
Catecholamines and their breakdown products are normally present in the urine in small fluctuating amounts that increase appreciably during and shortly after a stressful situation.
However, rare tumors of the adrenal gland called pheochromocytomas and rare tumors outside the adrenal glands called paragangliomas can produce large amounts of catecholamines and their metabolites, resulting in greatly increased concentrations in both the blood and urine. (These syndromes are often grouped together and abbreviated as PPGL). This can cause persistent or episodic periods of hypertension, which may lead to severe headaches. Other symptoms include heart palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the hands and feet.
Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are rare. While a few are cancerous, most are benign and do not spread beyond their original location. Left untreated, however, these tumors may continue to grow and the symptoms may worsen. Over time, the hypertension caused by the excess hormones may cause kidney damage, heart disease, and raise the risk of a stroke or heart attack.
Although they are rare, it is important to diagnose and treat these tumors because they cause a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, the tumors can be surgically removed and/or treated to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of catecholamines being produced and to reduce or eliminate associated symptoms and complications.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For the 24-hour urine collection, all urine should be saved for a 24-hour period. Empty the bladder completely without collecting. Then collect urine for 24 hours only – no more than 24 hours. It is important that the sample be refrigerated during this time.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Catecholamine levels, and by extension the levels of their metabolites, are affected by various drugs, foods and stresses. Preparation for the test is important to ensure that an appropriate sample is collected and for correct interpretation of results. Follow any instructions given by your healthcare practitioner or the collection site or laboratory.

You should talk to your healthcare provider about prescription medications and over-the-counter drugs and supplements that you are taking. It may be necessary to discontinue medications for some time prior to the test.
However, you should not stop taking any medications without consulting your healthcare provider. Your healthcare practitioner will work with you to identify potentially interfering substances and drug treatments and to determine which of them can be safely interrupted and which must be continued for your well-being.
You will also be instructed on what foods to avoid.
Avoid emotional and physical stresses and vigorous exercise prior to and during sample collection as they can increase catecholamine release and therefore affect metanephrine levels.

Urine metanephrines are ordered when your healthcare provider either suspects that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines or wants to rule out the possibility. It may be ordered when you (especially if you are younger than age 40) have sudden bursts (paroxysms) of signs and symptoms such as:

High blood pressure, especially when your hypertension is not responding to treatment (people with these tumors are frequently resistant to standard therapies)
Severe headaches
Sweating
Flushing
Rapid heart rate (palpitations)
Tremor

Testing may also be ordered when a tumor that releases catecholamines has been treated or removed to monitor for recurrence.
Occasionally, the test may be ordered when an adrenal tumor is detected by chance, such as during a scan conducted for another purpose, or when you have an inherited (genetic) risk or a family history of pheochromocytomas.



","



Normal urine levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine mean it is unlikely that you have a tumor that produces catecholamines. This test is very sensitive and these tumors are rare, so the negative predictive value of the test is very good.
Elevated levels of metanephrine and normetanephrine when you have signs and symptoms suggest the presence of a tumor. Generally, two times the upper limit of normal is considered positive for total metanephrine. If levels are elevated after you have been treated for one of these tumors, it may be an indication that the treatment was not fully effective or that the tumor is recurring and appropriate follow up is needed.
The test for metanephrines is very sensitive and false positives do occur. The test is affected by stress, drugs, smoking, and various foods. If you have only moderately elevated metanephrines, then your healthcare provider may re-evaluate your medications, diet, and stress level to look for interfering substances or conditions. Once these are resolved, you may be tested again to determine whether the metanephrines are still elevated.



","



While metanephrines testing can help detect and diagnose tumors that release catecholamines, it cannot tell your healthcare provider how big the tumor is, where it is located, how many tumors are present, or whether or not the tumor(s) are benign (although most are benign). Imaging studies may be used to locate the tumor and testing may be used to determine potential malignancy.
About 25% of PPGL occur in the setting of a hereditary syndrome associated with alterations in specific genes. These genetic syndromes have thus been identified as carrying an increased tumor risk. Examples include MEN-1 and MEN-2 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, types 1 and 2) syndromes. (For more information on these, see Genetics Home Reference: Multiple endocrine neoplasia.)



","



Urine metanephrines testing is used to help detect or rule out the presence of a rare tumor called a pheochromocytoma or a paraganglioma that releases excess metanephrines. Since these tumors (PPGL) produce these hormones in excess, measuring the amount in the blood and/or urine may help detect the tumors. Testing may also be used when a tumor has been treated or removed to monitor for recurrence.
The Endocrine Society recommends using a test for plasma free metanephrines or urine metanephrines to evaluate an individual for PPGL.

The blood test may be most useful when you have persistent hypertension or are currently experiencing a sudden burst (paroxysm) of hypertension. This is because the hormones do not stay long in the blood. They are used by the body and rapidly broken down (metabolized) and/or then eliminated.
Urine testing measures the total amount of metanephrines released into the urine in 24 hours. Since the hormone levels may fluctuate significantly during this period, the urine test may detect excess production that is missed with a blood test.

However, your healthcare practitioner may select any one (or more than one) of these tests depending on your signs and symptoms, family history, and/or genetic profile.

To screen for excess protein in the urine, to help evaluate and monitor kidney function, and to detect kidney damage


","

A single urine sample is collected in a clean container at any time (random/spot). For a 24-hour urine collection, the collection process generally begins first thing in the morning by discarding the first morning void and then collecting all of the urine for the remaining 24-hour period. The sample must be refrigerated during this period. There should be no preservatives in the container. Occasionally, a split 24-hour sample, with the night collection (11 pm to 7 am) separated from the day collection (7 am to 11 pm), may be used. Often, a blood sample may also be taken to measure your creatinine and serum protein levels, especially when 24-hour urine has been ordered.
Since the results from both types of sample collection methods are highly correlated, the spot urine collection may be used as a rapid and reliable alternative for UPCR measurement.


","



Urine protein tests detect and/or measure protein being released into the urine. Normal urine protein elimination is less than 150 mg/day and less than 30 mg of albumin/day. Elevated levels may be seen temporarily with conditions such as infections, stress, pregnancy, diet, cold exposure, or heavy exercise. Persistent protein in the urine suggests possible kidney damage or some other condition that requires additional testing to determine the cause.
There are several different kinds of urine protein tests, including:

A semi-quantitative protein ""dipstick"" may be performed as part of a urinalysis, generally on a random urine sample.
The quantity of protein in a 24-hour urine sample may be measured and reported as the amount of protein released per 24 hours.  
The amount of protein in a random urine sample may be measured along with urine creatinine and reported as the ratio of urine protein to creatinine (UPCR). 

Creatinine, a byproduct of muscle metabolism, is normally released into the urine at a constant rate. When both a urine creatinine and a random urine protein test are performed, the resulting protein/creatinine ratio approaches the accuracy of the 24-hour urine protein test. Since saving all of the urine for 24 hours can be cumbersome for adults and difficult for infants and children, a random urine protein to creatinine ratio is sometimes substituted for a 24-hour urine protein sample.
Plasma proteins are essential for all living beings. The kidneys, two organs found in the back at the bottom of the rib cage, recapture these proteins by filtering the blood by removing wastes and eliminating them from the body in the urine. When the kidneys are functioning normally, they retain or reabsorb the filtered proteins and return them to the blood.
However, if the kidneys are damaged or compromised due to other conditions, they become less effective at filtering, causing detectible amounts of protein to spill over into the urine. Routine dipstick testing of urine measures the presence of albumin. Albumin, a protein produced by the liver, makes up about 50%-60% of the protein in the blood. The rest is a mixture of globulins, including immunoglobulins. As kidney damage progresses, the amount of albumin in the urine increases, a key factor in the early detection of a potential kidney disorder.
Protein in the urine, also called proteinuria, is frequently seen in chronic diseases, such as diabetes and/or hypertension, with increasing amounts of protein in the urine reflecting increasing kidney damage. There are often no signs and symptoms with early kidney damage. As kidney damage progresses, or if protein loss is severe, you may develop symptoms such as fluid build-up (edema), shortness of breath, nausea, and fatigue. The production of too much protein, as seen with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and amyloidosis, can also lead to proteinuria.
The presence of albumin in the urine (albuminuria) is a sensitive indicator of kidney disease in people with diabetes and/or hypertension. Therefore, it is recommended that people with these conditions be regularly screened for albumin in the urine, as opposed to total urine protein (see Urine Albumin).

","

As part of a routine physical, often as part of a urinalysis; urine total protein and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) have traditionally been used as important indicators of kidney disease and as a follow-up testing for monitoring the disease. However, albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) is now the preferred testing for these purposes.
UPCR should still be requested to identify preeclampsia in pregnant women and where the excess urine total protein is suspected to be other than albumin.


","



A dipstick urine protein is measured (primarily albumin) frequently as a screening test whenever a urinalysis is performed. This may be done as part of a routine physical, a pregnancy workup, when a urinary tract infection is suspected, as part of a hospital admission, or whenever a healthcare practitioner wants to evaluate kidney function. Repeat testing may also be done when a previous dipstick has been positive for protein to see if the protein persists.
Specifically for monitoring people with possible kidney dysfunction, the National Kidney Foundation has established a 5-step plan for chronic kidney disease (CKD) evaluation and referral using random (spot) urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), rather than random UPCR, to screen for and determine the prognosis of CKD, for urine protein is more difficult to standardize. (For more details, see the article on Urine Albumin.)
A 24-hour urine protein may be ordered as a follow-up test, especially in pregnant women with a high pre-screen risk of preeclampsia, when the dipstick test shows that there is a large quantity of protein present in the urine or when protein is shown to be persistently present.
Since the dipstick primarily measures albumin, the healthcare practitioner may order a 24-hour urine protein test even when there is little protein detected on the dipstick if the practitioner suspects that there may be proteins other than albumin being released.
A protein to creatinine ratio may be ordered on a random urine sample when a child shows evidence of significant and persistent protein in their urine with the dipstick urine test.
Urine protein testing may be ordered on a regular basis when you are taking a medication that may potentially affect kidney function, including certain antibiotics, analgesics, COX-2 inhibitors (some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and proton pump inhibitors (gastric reflux).



","



A negative test result means that there is no detectable amount of protein in the urine at the time of testing.
Protein detected in a random urine sample may be temporary due to an infection, medication, vigorous exercise, pregnancy, diet, cold exposure, or emotional or physical stress. Testing should be repeated after these conditions have resolved.
Protein in the urine can also be a warning sign of a serious condition and usually warrants further investigation. Typically, three positive urine samples over a period of time without other significant symptoms will often be followed up with additional tests, including a 24-hour urine.
Persistent and/or an increased amount of protein in the urine may indicate kidney damage or disease. With kidney disease, the amount of protein present is generally associated with the severity of the damage. Increasing amounts of protein over time indicate increasing damage and decreasing kidney function. The most common cause of protein in the urine is kidney damage resulting from:

Diabetes – proteinuria is one of the first signs of deteriorating kidney function in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes.
High blood pressure (hypertension) – proteinuria in someone with high blood pressure is also a first sign of declining kidney function.

Proteinuria may also be seen with many other diseases and conditions. A healthcare practitioner may order other tests and take into account those results to help determine the cause. Some examples of these causes include:

Urinary tract infection
Preeclampsia
Lupus
Multiple myeloma
Amyloidosis
Bladder cancer
Congestive heart failure 
Drug therapies that are potentially toxic to the kidneys
Goodpasture syndrome
Heavy metal poisoning

","



The different methods of detecting protein in the urine vary in performance. For example, a positive dipstick protein may be elevated due to other sources of protein, such as blood, semen, or vaginal secretions in the urine. Since it measures primarily albumin, the dipstick may occasionally be normal when significant quantities of other proteins are present in the urine.
A 24-hour urine sample gives the protein elimination rate over 24 hours. It will be accurate only if all of the urine is collected. The protein to creatinine ratio is more of a snapshot of how much protein is in the urine at the time the sample is collected. If it is elevated, then protein is present; if it is negative, the amounts or the type of protein released in urine may not be detectable at that time.



","



Urine protein testing is used to detect excess protein in the urine (proteinuria). A semi-quantitative test such as a dipstick urine protein may be used to screen for the presence of protein in the urine as part of a routine urinalysis.
A urine protein test may be used to screen for, help evaluate, and monitor kidney function and to help detect and diagnose early kidney damage and/or disease. However, the test can also help screen for several other conditions that can cause proteinuria.
If slight to moderate amounts of protein are detected, then a repeat urinalysis and dipstick protein may be performed at a later time to see if there is still protein in the urine or if it has become undetectable.
If there is a large amount of protein in the first sample, repeat testing will be ordered. If increased levels of urine protein are observed in follow-up specimens, then a 24-hour urine protein may be ordered along with certain blood tests. Since the dipstick method primarily measures the protein albumin, and if follow-up, repeat urine samples are positive, a 24-hour urine test also may be ordered to obtain more detailed information.
A urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/CR) may be ordered on a random urine sample if there is evidence of significant and persistent protein in the urine. Children and sometimes adults occasionally have some degree of transient proteinuria without apparent kidney dysfunction and may release more protein into their urine during the day than at night. The healthcare practitioner may monitor their urine at intervals to see if the amount of proteinuria changes over time.
Either a 24-hour urine protein or a random protein to creatinine ratio may be used to monitor a person with known kidney disease or damage. A dipstick urine protein and/or a protein to creatinine ratio may be used to screen people on a regular basis when they are taking a medication that may affect their kidney function.

valproic-acid,"['Valproate', 'Free Valproic Acid']","

No special test preparation is needed, but talk to your healthcare practitioner about the timing of sample collection. Since dosage timing varies and some formulations are time-released, collection specifics may vary. Often, the recommended time for sample collection is just before the next dose is received, when the drug level is at its lowest (trough level). This ensures that the minimum amount of drug to be effective is maintained in the blood.


","

To determine the concentration of valproic acid in your blood; the purpose is to maintain a therapeutic level and monitor toxicity.


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Valproic acid is a drug that is used primarily to control certain seizures by lessening their severity and frequency. It may be prescribed in combination with other antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. The valproic acid level in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. This test measures the level of valproic acid in the blood.
Seizure disorders affect the brain's ability to transmit electrical impulses and to regulate nerve activity. During a seizure, someone may experience changes in consciousness, alterations in sight, smell, and taste, and may experience convulsions. Seizures are associated with several conditions but, in many cases, the cause is not known. The frequency of seizures varies from a single episode, to frequent, recurrent seizures. Rarely, someone may have a seizure that does not stop without prompt medical intervention. People may experience some fatigue and a short period of confusion after a seizure. Muscle contractions during a seizure can lead to an injury and, in some cases, recurrent seizures can eventually lead to progressive brain damage but, for most people, there will be little or no residual damage.
Sometimes valproic acid is prescribed for bipolar disorder, a psychiatric condition characterized by cycles of depression and mania that may last for days, weeks, months, or years. During a depressive episode, those affected may feel sad, hopeless, worthless, and have thoughts of suicide. During a manic episode, those affected may be euphoric, irritable, use poor judgment, and participate in risky behaviors. Valproic acid is prescribed to help even out the moods, especially those of mania, of the person with bipolar disorder. The drug is also used to treat people with recurrent migraine headaches to help prevent their occurrence and to treat certain chronic pain syndromes.
The valproic acid level in the blood must be maintained within a narrow therapeutic range. If the level is too low, someone may experience a recurrence of symptoms, but, if the level is too high, someone may experience an increase in the number and severity of symptoms and side effects. The balance is often difficult to achieve because the drug is metabolized by the liver and is processed at a rate that varies from person to person and is affected by age and liver health.
Most valproic acid is bound to protein in the blood and it is the unbound ""free"" portion that has therapeutic effect. If someone has a condition that results in a lower than normal amount of protein in their blood, then that person may have an excess of active ""free"" valproic acid.
Dosages of valproic acid must be adjusted carefully until a steady concentration in the blood is reached. The actual amount of drug that it takes to reach this steady state will vary from person to person and may change over time.

At regular intervals to monitor the drug's level or when a person shows signs of toxicity


","



A valproic acid test is ordered when someone begins valproic acid treatment as well as when their medications change (other drugs are started, stopped, or changed). Once a stable blood concentration in the therapeutic range has been achieved, the valproic acid level may then be monitored at regular intervals to ensure that it remains within the therapeutic range.
The test may be ordered when a person's condition does not appear to be responding to valproic acid to determine whether the concentration is too low, the medication is ineffective, and/or to determine if someone is complying with therapy (taking the valproic acid regularly). It may also be ordered when someone experiences a troublesome level of side effects and/or develops complications. These side effects may include some or a combination of the following:

Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
Dizziness
Unusual weight gain or loss
Tremors
Blurred or double vision, uncontrolled eye movements
Mood swings
Unusual bruising and bleeding
Hives
Hair loss
Ringing in the ears
Back pain

The very young and the elderly are more likely to experience increased side effects.
Rare but serious side effects requiring medical attention include unusual bruising or bleeding, tiny purple or red spots on the skin, fever, blisters or rash, bruising, hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, confusion, fatigue, vomiting, drop in body temperature, and weakness in the joints.
A free valproic acid test may be ordered when someone has an underlying condition that affects the balance of protein-bound drug, such as low protein level in the blood (hypoalbuminemia) or kidney or liver failure. These conditions increase the risk of having excessive amounts of valproic acid in the blood. Use of certain medications may also prompt a healthcare practitioner to order a free valproic acid test.



","



The therapeutic range for total valproic acid (bound and unbound) has been established at 50-125 µg/mL and 6-22 µg/mL for free valproic acid (unbound only). The recommended range for the treatment of epilepsy is 50-100 µg/mL total valproic acid, while the recommended range for the treatment of acute mania is 85-125 µg/mL total valproic acid.
Within these ranges, most people will respond to the drug without excessive side effects; however, response varies with each individual. Some people will experience seizures, mood swings, or migraines at the low end of the therapeutic range while some people will experience excessive side effects at the upper end. Patients should work closely with their healthcare practitioner to find the dosage and concentration that works the best for them.
In general, if the valproic acid result is within the therapeutic range, the person is not having recurrent seizures, mood swings, or migraines, and is not experiencing significant side effects, then the dosage is considered adequate.
People should not increase, decrease, or stop taking their medication without consulting with their healthcare provider as it can increase the risk of having a seizure and may affect other medications being taken. Dosage determinations and adjustments must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.



","



Rare complications associated with use of valproic acid include pancreatitis and liver dysfunction. Serious liver damage is most likely to occur within the first six months of therapy.
While severe liver injury is rare, mild increases in liver-related enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) occur in up to 20% of those taking valproic acid; these usually return to normal even if the drug is continued.
The use of valproic acid during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of several birth defects, especially neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare practitioner about this.
A variety of prescribed drugs, over-the-counter medications, and supplements can increase, decrease, or interfere with the concentrations of valproic acid in the blood. Tell your healthcare providers about all prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking.



",,"



The valproic acid test is used to measure and monitor the amount of valproic acid in the blood and determine whether the drug concentration is within the therapeutic range.
The prescribed dose of the drug may be adjusted up or down depending on the results of the blood test. The test may then be ordered at regular intervals, and as needed, to ensure that therapeutic blood concentrations are maintained.
One or more valproic acid tests may be ordered when someone starts or stops taking additional medications to judge their effect, if any, on the valproic acid level and may be ordered if the person has a recurrence of symptoms, such as a seizure, a migraine, or bipolar mood swings. Healthcare practitioners will also evaluate their patients for side effects and adverse reactions during initial dosage adjustments and over time.
While total valproic acid tests are usual, healthcare practitioners may order a ""free"" valproic acid test to monitor blood levels of the drug in patients with certain conditions or in particular disease states. Valproic acid in the blood is highly bound to proteins and only the portion of valproic acid that is unbound or ""free"" is pharmacologically active. Under normal conditions, the balance between bound and unbound valproic acid in the blood is relatively stable, so measuring the total valproic acid is appropriate for monitoring the therapeutic level. However, in certain conditions and disease states, that balance can be disturbed, the percentage of free or active valproic acid can increase, and the person may experience symptoms of toxicity even though their total valproic acid result falls within the therapeutic range.

vancomycin,,"

None, but timing of the sample for testing is important; samples are typically collected just before the next dose (trough level). Follow any instructions provided.


","

To measure and monitor the level of vancomycin in your blood


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. This test measures the concentration of vancomycin in the blood.
Developed in the 1950s, vancomycin was originally prescribed primarily when organisms proved resistant to penicillin or when a person was allergic to penicillin. Its use declined with the introduction of other antimicrobials such as methicillin but has risen again with the emergence of certain strains of Staphylococcus, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
It is important to monitor the level of vancomycin because its effectiveness depends on sustaining blood levels at a minimum concentration for the duration of therapy. Furthermore, excessive concentrations of vancomycin must be avoided because high levels can result in serious side effects, specifically hearing (ototoxicity) and kidney damage (nephrotoxicity). The amount of vancomycin given per dose depends on a variety of factors, including kidney function, other nephrotoxic drugs the person may be taking, age, and weight.
Decreased kidney function may prevent efficient clearance of vancomycin from a person's system, resulting in increased concentration in the blood. If a person is given too little drug and is unable to maintain a sufficient minimum dose in the blood, then it is unlikely that treatment will be effective. The vancomycin test can be used to monitor the amount of drug in the blood to ensure that it remains at a therapeutic concentration – that is, adequate but not excessive.
Vancomycin is given intravenously (by injection into a vein) to treat infections such as septicemia, endocarditis, infection of the bone (osteomyelitis), some pneumonias, and meningitis. It is often the drug of choice for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and MRSA infections, especially when they are associated with implanted prosthetic devices such as heart valves, artificial hips, and indwelling catheters. Vancomycin may also be given to some people before specific surgeries and dental procedures to prevent an infection.
Intravenous vancomycin administration is necessary to get the drug into circulation because vancomycin taken as a pill by mouth (oral) is poorly absorbed in the digestive tract. However, oral vancomycin may be prescribed to treat some infections of the digestive tract, where absorption into the circulating blood is not needed. An example is Clostridium difficile infection.

","

At intervals during vancomycin treatment


","



There is no widespread consensus on the use of the vancomycin test and when to order it. Some healthcare practitioners will order trough levels every few days throughout vancomycin treatment. Some will order both trough and peak concentrations at regular intervals. Many do not feel that general monitoring is necessary and will only order the tests for those who are at increased risk of kidney damage (nephrotoxicity), who are taking concurrent medications, who have decreased kidney function, or who are not responding to treatment as expected.



","



Guidelines from 2009 by pharmacists and infectious disease specialists recommend that only trough levels be performed, with a minimum of 10 mcg/mL considered necessary to control an infection. The guidelines recommend a therapeutic range of 15-20 mcg/mL for significant infections. However, many institutions have specific ranges depending on the site of infection and severity of infection.
If trough levels of vancomycin are above the minimum level, then the person should be receiving enough of the drug to be effective. If the person's infection is not responding to the treatment, then the healthcare practitioner may either continue the drug for a longer period of time or consider other treatment options. If peak concentrations are below maximum levels, then the treated person is at less risk of developing nephrotoxicity and/or ototoxicity but may still experience either complication. Peak concentrations may vary, depending on the consistency of collection timing and on changing drug clearance rates.
If the trough and/or peak concentrations are above the maximum levels, then the person is at an increased risk of toxicity and the healthcare practitioner may either alter the dose or the dosing schedule.



","



An intravenous vancomycin dose must be given slowly. People given the dose at a rapid rate are at an increased risk of developing ""red man syndrome,"" a histamine reaction that causes flushing of the face, a rash on the upper body, and a significant drop in blood pressure.



",,"



This test is used to monitor levels of the antibiotic vancomycin in the blood. When a person takes a dose of vancomycin, the amount in the blood rises for a period of time, peaks, and then begins to fall, usually reaching its lowest level, or trough, just before the next dose. The next dose is timed to coincide with the falling concentration of the drug in the blood.
Because the goal is to administer the vancomycin such that a minimally effective concentration is always maintained in the blood, measurement of blood levels is usually timed to reflect the trough and, sometimes peak, to evaluate the adequacy of dosing and clearance of the drug from the body. Trough levels are collected just prior to a person's next vancomycin dose. Peak levels are collected 1 to 2 hours after the completion of the intravenous vancomycin dose.
The trough and sometimes peak values are used by clinical pharmacists and healthcare practitioners to calculate rates of absorption and clearance of the drug. These results are then used to determine the appropriate amount of drug and the appropriate timing between doses to assure that the blood concentration remains in the therapeutic range.
For additional information on how the test is used, see Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.

vanillylmandelic-acid-vma,['VMAU'],"

This test is affected by caffeine, certain foods, certain drugs, and stresses. Inform your healthcare practitioner of any medications you are taking and follow any instructions you are given for things to avoid before sample collection.


","

To help diagnose or rule out a neuroblastoma or other neuroendocrine tumor; to monitor the effectiveness of treatment


","

A 24-hour urine sample is preferred; sometimes a random urine sample is acceptable.


","



Vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) is one of the breakdown products (metabolites) of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Epinephrine and norepinephrine belong to a group of similar hormones called catecholamines. This test measures the amount of VMA that is passed into the urine, typically over a 24-hour period, to detect excess epinephrine and norepinephrine. It is used to detect tumors called neuroblastomas and other neuroendocrine tumors.
Catecholamines are produced in the central portion of the adrenal glands, the adrenal medulla. Adrenal glands are small triangular organs located on top of each kidney. The primary catecholamines released are dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. These hormones are released into the bloodstream in response to physical or emotional stress. They help transmit nerve impulses in the brain, increase glucose and fatty acid release for energy, dilate bronchioles, and dilate the pupils. Norepinephrine also constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure, and epinephrine increases heart rate and metabolism.
After completing their actions, the catecholamines are metabolized to inactive compounds. Dopamine becomes homovanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine breaks down into normetanephrine and VMA, and epinephrine becomes metanephrine and VMA. Both the hormones and their metabolites are eliminated from the body in the urine. VMA is usually present in the urine in small fluctuating amounts that only increase appreciably during and shortly after the body is exposed to a stressor.
Sometimes, tumors begin to form in the cells of the neuroendocrine system, which is made up of a combination of cells that produce hormones and nerve cells. These types of cells are found throughout the body in organs such as the lungs and the digestive system. Tumors that form in these cells are called neuroendocrine tumors.
Neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas, can sometimes produce large amounts of catecholamines, resulting in greatly increased concentrations of the hormones and their metabolites. The hormone releases can cause illness and signs and symptoms, such as persistent hypertension, severe headaches, palpitations, sweating, nausea, anxiety, and tingling in the extremities.
Neuroblastomas are rare cancers, but they are the most common cancers affecting infants, according to the American Cancer Society. About 700 new cases are diagnosed each year, primarily in babies one to two years old, with up to 90% of cases occurring in children under the age of five. Rarely, a baby may be born with a neuroblastoma. Arising from primitive nerve cells, these cancers can be found in the abdomen, adrenal glands, neck, chest, or pelvis. About two-thirds of the time, the tumors will have spread (metastasized) to other parts of the body by the time they are diagnosed.
Once detected, many neuroblastomas can be successfully treated. In some cases, neuroblastomas may disappear without treatment. In other cases, their cells may spontaneously mature into normal nerves cells, turning the neuroblastoma into a benign ganglioneuroma or into a partially benign ganglioneuroblastoma.
Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that arise primarily in the adrenal glands. According to the National Cancer Institute, they affect 2 to 8 people per million per year, primarily those in their thirties to fifties. Most pheochromocytomas are benign and do not spread from their original location, but some may metastasize and move to other organs within the body. Left untreated, they continue to grow and produce catecholamines, and hormone-related symptoms continue to worsen.
Over time, hypertension caused by the pheochromocytoma may damage body organs, such as the kidneys and heart, and raise the risk of an affected person having a stroke or heart attack. Pheochromocytomas are important to diagnose because they represent a potentially curable form of hypertension. In most cases, they can be removed and/or treated to reduce or eliminate the associated symptoms and complications.
The VMA test, along with other tests for catecholamines and their metabolites, can be used to help detect the presence of neuroblastomas. The preferred tests for pheochromocytomas are plasma free metanephrines, urine metanephrines, and urine or plasma catecholamine tests. However, the VMA test may still be ordered along with one or more of these tests to help detect and rule out a pheochromocytoma.
How is the sample collected for testing?
For a 24-hour urine collection, all of the urine produced during a 24-hour period should be saved. It is important that the sample be refrigerated during this time period. A single urine sample is collected for a random urine test.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
This test is affected by caffeine, certain foods, certain drugs, and stresses. It is important to inform your healthcare practitioner of any medications you are taking, including herbal supplements and over-the-counter products, and to follow any instructions provided for things to avoid before sample collection.

When your child has a lump in the abdomen (abdominal mass), bruising around the eyes, trouble walking, or bone pain; when you have symptoms of increased catecholamine release, such as persistent or periodic high blood pressure, severe headaches, rapid heart rate, and sweating; when you have been treated for a neuroendocrine tumor, such as neuroblastoma


","



VMA testing is ordered when a healthcare practitioner either suspects that a child has a neuroblastoma or wants to rule out the possibility. A healthcare practitioner may order it, along with an homovanillic acid (HVA) test, when a child has an abdominal mass or other symptoms suggestive of a neuroblastoma. These signs and symptoms can vary depending upon their location and may vary over time:

Most neuroblastomas are located in the belly, so the most common symptom is an unusual non-tender lump or mass in that area. Others include abdominal pain and lack of appetite.
Sometimes a tumor in the neck can cause swelling and affect swallowing or breathing.
If the tumor presses on nerves by the spine, it may affect the child's ability to walk.
If it has spread to the bones (metastasized), it may cause bone pain, and if to the marrow, it may affect blood cell production, causing fatigue, pallor, and bleeding.

A neuroblastoma can also cause bruising around the eyes and drooping eyelids, bluish purple spots on the skin, and can sometimes affect bladder and bowel function. Rarely, it may cause muscle spasms and rapid eye movements referred to as ""dancing eyes, dancing feet.""
The VMA test may also be ordered when a child has been treated for a neuroblastoma and ordered periodically to monitor for recurrence.
A VMA test sometimes may be ordered along with one or more metanephrine or catecholamine tests when a healthcare practitioner suspects that a person has a pheochromocytoma. They may be ordered when a person has persistent or recurring hypertension that is not responding to conventional therapies, to monitor the effectiveness of treatment for a pheochromocytoma, and periodically to monitor for recurrence.



","



Since the VMA test is sensitive to many outside influences, and neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas are rare, the false-positive rate for this test is high – greater than 15%. When a person has large amounts of VMA in his or her urine, it is not diagnostic of a condition; it is an indication that further investigation is necessary.
Intense emotional and physical stresses can cause moderate to large temporary increases in VMA levels. The healthcare practitioner must evaluate the child or adult as a whole – his or her physical condition, emotional state, prescribed medications, and any over-the-counter products that the person is taking. When interfering substances and/or conditions are found and resolved, the healthcare practitioner will frequently re-test the person to determine whether the VMA is still elevated. The healthcare practitioner may also order other catecholamine and metanephrine testing, genetic mutation testing, and imaging tests such as an MRI to help find the tumor(s).
If a child or adult is being treated for a neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma, then decreasing VMA concentrations indicate a response to treatment; stable or increasing levels indicate that the treatment is not effective. If a VMA concentration is initially normal and then increases in a person who has had a previous neuroblastoma or pheochromocytoma, then it is likely that the tumor is recurring.
About 90% of children with a neuroblastoma will produce excess VMA and homovanillic acid. If a VMA and other catecholamine and metanephrine testing are normal, then it is less likely that a child has a neuroblastoma or an adult has a pheochromocytoma, but it cannot be ruled out. The tumors do not necessarily produce catecholamines at a constant rate, so increases in the hormones and metabolites will fluctuate in the urine and may not be increased in the sample tested. This is especially true when a single random urine sample is tested.



","



The amount of VMA produced does not necessarily correspond to the size of the tumor. This is a physical characteristic of the tumor tissue. The total amount of VMA produced will tend to increase, however, as the tumor increases in size.
A healthcare practitioner will sometimes evaluate a VMA-to-HVA ratio with a neuroblastoma. A low ratio is associated with a poorer prognosis.
A variety of medications can interfere with VMA testing, but those being tested should always consult with their healthcare practitioner before discontinuing any prescribed medications. Some of the drugs that can interfere include appetite suppressants, caffeine, clonidine, disulfiram, histamine, imipramine, insulin, epinephrine, levodopa, lithium, morphine, MAO inhibitors, nitroglycerin, and rauwolfia alkaloids. The effects of these drugs on VMA results will be different from person to person and are often not predictable.



",,"



The vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) test is primarily used to detect and rule out tumors called neuroblastomas in children with an abdominal mass or other symptoms suggestive of the disease. It may be ordered along with an homovanillic acid (HVA) test to help diagnose a neuroblastoma, to monitor the effectiveness of treatment, and to monitor for neuroblastoma recurrence.
A urine creatinine test is typically also ordered, especially with random urine testing, and tests results are frequently reported as VMA-to-creatinine and HVA-to-creatinine ratios. Since creatinine is a substance that is passed into the urine at a relatively constant rate, it serves as a comparison to the amounts of VMA and HVA.
A VMA test was once frequently ordered to detect pheochromocytomas, but the preferred tests are now plasma free metanephrines, urine metanephrines, and urine or plasma catecholamine tests. The VMA test may still be ordered along with one or more of these tests to help detect and rule out a pheochromocytoma.

To detect vitamin A deficiency or toxicity


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein


","



Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many of the foods we eat. Retinol is the primary form of vitamin A in humans. This test measures the level of retinol in the blood.
Vitamin A is an essential nutrient required for healthy vision and skin, bone formation, immune system function, and reproduction. It is required to produce photoreceptors in the eyes and to maintain the lining of the surface of the eyes and other mucous membranes. A lack of vitamin A can affect night vision, cause eye damage, and in severe cases, lead to blindness. Too much vitamin A can be toxic, causing a range of symptoms, and sometimes leading to birth defects.
The body cannot make vitamin A and must rely on dietary sources of vitamin A. Meat sources provide vitamin A (as retinol), while vegetable and fruit sources provide carotene (a substance that can be converted into vitamin A by the liver). Vitamin A is stored in the liver and fat tissues (it is fat-soluble), and healthy adults may have as much as a year's worth stored. The body maintains a relatively stable level in the blood through a feedback system that releases vitamin A from storage as needed and increases or decreases the efficiency of dietary vitamin A absorption.
Deficiencies in vitamin A are rare in the United States, but they are a major health problem in as many as half of all countries, especially in resource-poor nations where high numbers of people have limited diets, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). One of the first signs of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness. Young children and pregnant women are most commonly affected, say the WHO.
In the U.S., vitamin A deficiencies are primarily seen in those with malnutrition, chronic diarrhea, malabsorption disorders such as celiac disease, cystic fibrosis, or chronic pancreatitis, in the elderly, and in those with alcoholism, liver disease and blockage of the bile ducts. Surgery either on the intestine or pancreas can have the similar consequences.
Vitamin A deficiency is a risk factor for severe measles; treatment with vitamin A can shorten the duration of the disorder and may reduce the severity of symptoms and risk of death.
Vitamin A toxicity occurs primarily from overuse of vitamin supplements. However, it can sometimes occur when the diet includes a high proportion of foods that are high in vitamin A, such as liver.

A normal vitamin A blood level means you currently have enough vitamin A, but it does not indicate how much you have stored in reserve. The body will maintain vitamin A in the blood at a relatively stable level until stores are low.
A low vitamin A blood test result means you lack enough vitamin A (deficiency). This can lead to night blindness, among other complications.
A high vitamin A blood level typically means too much vitamin A is circulating in the blood and may be deposited in other parts of the body, leading to toxicity. Getting too much vitamin A, usually from supplements or certain medications, can cause dizziness, headaches, and nausea. In serious cases, it can lead to coma and be life-threatening. In pregnant women, too much vitamin A can cause birth defects in their babies.



","



People with a minimal amount of vitamin A stored may have marginal but adequate vitamin A until they have an illness or other condition, such as pregnancy, that puts increased demands on their body. This is one of the reasons that night blindness is prevalent in many parts of the world during pregnancy.
Eating excessive amounts of foods with beta carotene, such as carrots, can cause a person's skin to turn yellow-orange but it does not cause vitamin A toxicity. The body does not convert beta carotene to vitamin A when there is sufficient vitamin A present.



","



Vitamin A testing is used to help diagnose a vitamin A deficiency in people with signs and symptoms, such as night blindness, or in people who are at risk of vitamin A deficiency. Testing for this purpose is not common because vitamin A deficiencies are rare in the United States.
Sometimes testing may be used to detect toxic levels caused by consuming large amounts of vitamin A.

Vitamin B12 and folate are two vitamins that are part of the B complex of vitamins. B12 and folate work with vitamin C to help the body make new proteins. They are necessary for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation, repair of tissues and cells, and synthesis of DNA. Both are nutrients that cannot be produced in the body and must be supplied by the diet.
Vitamin B12 and folate tests measure vitamin levels in the liquid portion of the blood (serum or plasma) to detect deficiencies. Sometimes the amount of folate inside red blood cells may also be measured.

Vitamin B12, also called cobalamin, is found in foods from animals, such as red meat, fish, poultry, milk, yogurt, and eggs.
Folate (Vitamin B9) refers to a natural occurring form of the vitamin, whereas folic acid refers to the supplement added to foods and drinks. Folate is found in leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, dry beans and peas, liver, and yeast.

In recent years, fortified cereals, breads, and other grain products have also become important dietary sources of B12 and folate (identified as ""folic acid"" on nutritional labels).
A deficiency in either B12 or folate can lead to macrocytic anemia, where red blood cells are larger than normal. Megaloblastic anemia, a type of macrocytic anemia, is characterized by the production of fewer but larger RBCs called macrocytes, in addition to some cellular changes in the bone marrow. Other laboratory findings associated with megaloblastic anemia include decreased WBC count, RBC count, reticulocyte count, and platelet count.
B12 is also important for nerve health and a deficiency can lead to varying degrees of neuropathy, nerve damage that can cause tingling and numbness in the affected person's hands and feet.
Folate is necessary for cell division such as is seen in a developing fetus. Folate deficiency during early pregnancy can increase the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida in a growing fetus.
B12 and folate deficiencies are most often caused by not getting enough of the vitamins through the diet or supplements, long-term use of certain medications, inadequate absorption, or by increased need as seen in pregnancy:

Dietary deficiencies—these are uncommon in the United States because many foods and drinks are supplemented with these vitamins, which are stored by the body. Adults typically have several years' worth of vitamin B12 stored in the liver and about 3 months of stored folate. Dietary deficiencies do not usually cause symptoms until stores of the vitamins within the body have been depleted. B12 deficiencies are sometimes seen in vegans (those who do not consume any animal products) and in their breast-fed infants.
Inadequate absorption—vitamin B12 absorption occurs in a series of steps. B12 is normally released from food by stomach acid and then, in the small intestine, is bound to intrinsic factor (IF), a protein made by parietal cells in the stomach. This B12-IF complex is then absorbed by the small intestine, bound by carrier proteins (transcobalamins), and enters the circulation. If a disease or condition interferes with any of these steps, then B12 absorption is impaired.
Increased need—this can be seen with a variety of diseases and conditions. Increased demand for folate occurs when a woman is pregnant or nursing, in early childhood, with cancers, or with chronic hemolytic anemias.

When you have abnormal results on a complete blood count (CBC) with a blood smear showing large red blood cells (macrocytosis) or abnormal (hypersegmented) neutrophils; when you have symptoms of anemia (weakness, tiredness, pale skin) and/or of neuropathy (tingling or itching sensations, eye twitching, memory loss, altered mental status); when you are being treated for vitamin B12 or folate deficiency


","



B12 and folate levels may be ordered when a complete blood count (CBC) and/or blood smear, done as part of a health checkup or an evaluation for anemia, shows a low red blood cell (RBC) count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and the presence of large RBCs. Specifically, a high RBC mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicates that the RBCs are enlarged. In addition to enlarged RBCs on the blood smear, the nucleus of white cell neutrophils show many segments (hypersegmented neutrophils), a classic sign frequently observed.
Testing for B12 and folate levels may be ordered when you have signs and symptoms of a deficiency, such as:

Diarrhea
Dizziness, trouble walking
Fatigue, muscle weakness
Loss of appetite
Pale skin
Rapid heart rate, irregular heartbeats
Shortness of breath
Sore tongue and mouth
Tingling, numbness, and/or burning in the feet, hands, arms, and legs (with B12 deficiency)
Confusion or forgetfulness
Paranoia, irritability

B12 and folate testing may sometimes be ordered when you have a condition that puts you at risk of a deficiency.
These tests may be ordered on a regular basis when you are treated for malnutrition or a B12 or folate deficiency. For individuals with a condition causing a chronic deficiency, this may be part of a long-term treatment plan.



","



Normal B12 and folate blood levels may mean that you do not have a deficiency and that your signs and symptoms are likely due to another cause. However, normal levels may reflect the fact that your stored B12 and/or folate have not yet been fully depleted.
When a B12 level is normal or low normal but a deficiency is still suspected, a healthcare practitioner may order a methylmalonic acid (MMA) test as an early indicator of B12 deficiency.
A low B12 and/or folate level means that you have a deficiency. Additional tests are usually done to investigate the underlying cause of the deficiency. Some causes of low B12 or folate include:

Conditions that interfere with their absorption in the small intestine. These may include:
	
Pernicious anemia, the most common cause of B12 deficiency
Celiac disease and tropical sprue
Inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis
Bacterial overgrowth or the presence of parasites, such as tapeworms, in the intestines
Reduced stomach acid production from long-term (more than one year) use of antacids or H2 receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors
Surgery that removes part of the stomach, such as gastric bypass, or the intestines may greatly decrease absorption.
Pancreatic insufficiency (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency) - the pancreas is not able to produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food.


Dietary deficiency of folate or B12—this is uncommon in the U.S. However, it may be seen with general malnutrition, in the elderly and in vegans who do not consume any animal products. With the introduction of fortified cereals, breads, and other grain products, folate deficiency is very rare.
Heavy drinking or chronic alcoholism
Use of some drugs such as metformin, omeprazole, methotrexate or anti-seizure medications such as phenytoin
Increased need—all pregnant women need increased amounts of folate for proper fetal development and are recommended to take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day. People with cancer that has spread (metastasized) or with chronic hemolytic anemia have increased need for folate.
Smoking

For additional information, see the article Vitamin B12 and Folate Deficiencies.
If a person with a B12 or folate deficiency is being treated with supplements (or with B12 injections), then normal or elevated results indicate a response to treatment.
High levels of B12 are uncommon and not usually clinically monitored. However, if someone has a condition such as chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm, diabetes, heart failure, obesity, AIDS, or severe liver disease, then that person may have an increased vitamin B12 level. Ingesting estrogens, vitamin C or vitamin A can also cause high B12 levels.



","



If a person is deficient in both B12 and folate but only takes folic acid supplements, the B12 deficiency may be masked. The anemia associated with both may be resolved, but the underlying neuropathy will persist.
Intrinsic factor antibodies can interfere with the vitamin B12 test, producing falsely elevated results. If a person has these antibodies in their blood, the results of their B12 test must be interpreted with caution.
Since folate deficiency is rarely seen in the U.S., some laboratories no longer offer the folate test. Your sample may need to be sent to a reference laboratory.  



","



Vitamin B12 and folate are separate tests often used together to:

Detect low levels (deficiencies)
Diagnose the cause of certain anemias, such as pernicious anemia, an autoimmune disease that affects the absorption of B12
Help determine the cause of an altered mental state or other behavioral changes, especially in the elderly 
Help determine the cause of signs and symptoms of a condition affecting nerves (neuropathy)
Evaluate your general health and nutritional status if you have signs and symptoms of significant malnutrition or dietary malabsorption.
Monitor the effectiveness of treatment with vitamin B12 and folate supplements; this is especially true for those who cannot properly absorb B12 and/or folate and must have lifelong treatment.

Serum folate levels can vary based on a person's recent diet. Because red blood cells store 95% of circulating folate, a test to measure the folate level within RBCs may be used in addition to the serum test. Some healthcare practitioners feel that the RBC folate test is a better indicator of long-term folate status and is more clinically relevant than serum folate, but there is not widespread agreement on this.

Vitamin D is a family of compounds that is essential for the proper growth and formation of teeth and bones. This test measures the level of vitamin D in the blood.
Two forms of vitamin D can be measured in the blood, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D is the major form found in the blood and is the relatively inactive precursor to the active hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Because of its long half-life and higher concentration, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is commonly measured to assess and monitor vitamin D status in individuals.
Vitamin D comes from two sources: endogenous, which is produced in the skin on exposure to sunlight, and exogenous, which is ingested in foods and supplements. The chemical structures of the types of vitamin D are slightly different, and they are named vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol, which comes from plants) and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, which comes from animals). The D2 form is found in fortified foods and in most vitamin preparations and supplements. Vitamin D3 is the form produced in the body and is also used in some supplements. Vitamin D2 and D3 are equally effective when they are converted by the liver and the kidney into the active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
Some tests do not distinguish D2 and D3 forms of the vitamin and report only the total result. Newer methods, however, may report levels of both D2 and D3 and then add them together for a total level.
The main role of vitamin D is to help regulate blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and (to a lesser extent) magnesium. Vitamin D is vital for the growth and health of bone; without it, bones will be soft, malformed, and unable to repair themselves normally, resulting in diseases called rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Vitamin D has also been shown to influence the growth and differentiation of many other tissues and to help regulate the immune system. These other functions have implicated vitamin D in other disorders, such as autoimmunity and cancer.
Based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that two-thirds of U.S. population has sufficient vitamin D, while roughly one-quarter are at risk of inadequate vitamin D and 8% are at risk of deficiency, as defined by the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) set by the Institute of Medicine.
People at higher risk of deficiency include the elderly or obese people, people who don't get enough sun exposure, people with darker skin, and people who take certain medications for long periods of time. Adequate sun exposure is typically estimated to be two periods per week of 5-20 minutes. People who do not have adequate sun exposure may obtain the vitamin D that they need from food sources or supplements.

","



25-hydroxyvitamin D
When calcium is low and/or a person has symptoms of vitamin D deficiency, such as bone malformation in children (rickets) and bone weakness, softness, or fracture in adults (osteomalacia), 25-hydroxyvitamin D usually is ordered to identify a possible deficiency in vitamin D.
The test may be requested when an individual is known to be at risk of vitamin D deficiency. Older adults, people who are institutionalized or homebound and/or have limited sun exposure, those who are obese, who have undergone gastric bypass surgery, and/or who have fat malabsorption are at an increased risk of a vitamin D deficiency. Also included in this group are people with darker skin and breastfed infants.
25-hydroxyvitamin D is often requested before an individual begins drug therapy for osteoporosis.
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
This testing may be ordered when kidney disease or abnormalities of the enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is suspected. Rarely, this test may be done when calcium is high or a person has a disease that might produce excess amounts of vitamin D, such as sarcoidosis or some forms of lymphoma (because immune cells may make 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D).
When vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, or magnesium supplementation is necessary, vitamin D levels are sometimes measured to monitor treatment effectiveness.



","



Although there are differences among vitamin D methods, most laboratories utilize similar reference intervals. Because toxicity is rare, the focus has been on the lower limit and what cut-off for total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (D2 + D3) indicates deficiency.

The Endocrine Society defines vitamin D deficiency as a 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood level below 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/liter) and vitamin D insufficiency as a level between 21–29 ng/mL (52.5–72.5 nmol/liter).
The U.S. Institute of Medicine has concluded that a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/liter) or above is adequate for bone health, and that levels greater than 30 ng/mL do not offer significantly better effects. However, it is fair to say that the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D associated with protection from the many other disorders recently associated with a lack of vitamin D is controversial.

25-hydroxyvitamin D
A low blood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may mean that a person is not getting enough exposure to sunlight or enough dietary vitamin D to meet his or her body's demand or that there is a problem with its absorption from the intestines. Occasionally, drugs used to treat seizures, particularly phenytoin (Dilantin), can interfere with the production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver.
There is some evidence that vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of some cancers, immune diseases, and cardiovascular disease.
A high level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D usually reflects excess supplementation from vitamin pills or other nutritional supplements.
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
A low level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D can be seen in kidney disease and is one of the earliest changes to occur in persons with early kidney failure.
A high level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may occur when there is excess parathryoid hormone or when there are diseases, such as sarcoidosis or some lymphomas, that can make 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D outside of the kidneys.



","



High levels of vitamin D and calcium can lead to the calcification and damage to organs, particularly the kidneys and blood vessels.
If magnesium levels are low, they can cause a low calcium level that is resistant to vitamin D and parathyroid hormone regulation. It may be necessary to supplement both magnesium and calcium to regain normal function.



",,"



A vitamin D test is used to:

Determine if bone weakness, bone malformation, or abnormal metabolism of calcium (reflected by abnormal calcium, phosphorus, PTH) is occurring as a result of a deficiency or excess of vitamin D
Help diagnose or monitor problems with parathyroid gland functioning since PTH is essential for vitamin D activation
Screen people who are at high risk of deficiency, as recommended by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the Institute of Medicine, and the Endocrine Society
Help monitor the health status of individuals with diseases that interfere with fat absorption, such as cystic fibrosis and Crohn disease, since vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin and is absorbed from the intestine like a fat
Monitor people who have had gastric bypass surgery and may not be able to absorb enough vitamin D
Help determine the effectiveness of treatment when vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus, and/or magnesium supplementation is prescribed

Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL, VLDL-C) is one of the four major lipoprotein particles. The other three are high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and chylomicrons. Each particle contains a mixture of cholesterol, triglyceride, and protein, but in varying amounts unique to each type of particle. LDL contains the highest amount of cholesterol. HDL contains the highest amount of protein. VLDL and chylomicrons contain the highest amount of triglyceride.
VLDL particles are released into the blood by the liver and circulate in the bloodstream, ultimately being converted into LDL as they lose triglyceride, having carried it to other parts of the body. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines ATP III, there is growing evidence that VLDL plays an important role in atherogenesis, in which plaques form on the interior walls of arteries, narrowing these passageways and restricting blood flow, which can lead to heart disease and increase the risk of stroke.
Currently, direct measurement of VLDL cholesterol requires specialized testing. However, since VLDL-C contains most of the circulating triglyceride (if a person is fasting) and since the composition of the different particles is relatively constant, it is possible to estimate the amount of VLDL-C based on the triglyceride value. To estimate VLDL-C, divide the triglyceride value by 5 if the value is in mg/dL or divide by 2.2 if the value is in mmol/L. In most cases, this formula provides a good estimate of VLDL-C. 
However, this formula becomes less accurate with increased triglyceride levels when, for example, a person has not fasted before having blood drawn. The calculation is not valid when the triglyceride level is greater than 400 mg/dl (4.5 mmol/L) because other lipoproteins are usually present. In this situation, VLDL-C may be measured directly using specialized testing.

","



VLDL-C is generally not ordered as a separate test. It may be reported with the results of a lipid profile when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine a person's risk of heart disease.
Lipid profiles are recommended every 4-6 years to evaluate risk of heart disease in healthy adults. Children should have a lipid profile screening at least once between the ages of 9 and 11 and once again between the ages of 17 and 21.
Testing may be ordered more frequently to monitor treatment in people who have identified risk factors for heart disease. Risk factors include a family history of heart disease or health problems such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or being overweight.



","



An elevated level of VLDL cholesterol (greater than 30 mg/dL or greater than 0.77 mmol/L), like elevated LDL cholesterol, is considered a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. The presence of high VLDL in addition to high LDL may affect treatment decisions.
Low levels of VLDL cholesterol are not generally a concern.



","



VLDL cholesterol concentrations, like all lipoprotein fractions, can be measured directly using techniques such as lipoprotein electrophoresis and ultracentrifugation. However, these techniques are complex and expensive and are not usually done in clinical laboratories. These tests are generally carried out in specialty laboratories, most often for research purposes.



",,"



Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) may be reported as part of a lipid profile, a group of tests that are often ordered together to determine risk of coronary heart disease and an important part of cardiac risk assessments.
Increased levels of VLDL-C are thought to reflect the presence of particles called lipoprotein remnants that are intermediate particles on the pathway of conversion of VLDL to LDL. When high levels of VLDL are present, the conversion of VLDL to LDL is slowed and the accumulation of intermediate particles is thought to contribute to the development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.

","

","



Von Willebrand factor (vWF or VWF) is a protein that is one of several components of the coagulation system that work together, and in sequence, to stop bleeding within the body. VWF testing measures the amount of the protein present in blood and determines how well the protein functions.
Normally, when a blood vessel is damaged and bleeding begins, VWF forms an adhesive bridge between activated cell fragments called platelets and the injury site. This is followed by the clumping (aggregation) of platelets at the site and a series of actions referred to as activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in the formation of a stable blood clot.
VWF further affects clotting by influencing the availability of coagulation factor VIII. VWF carries factor VIII in the blood, increases its half-life, and releases it as necessary. If the amount of functional VWF is insufficient, then platelet adherence and aggregation are affected, levels of factor VIII could be decreased, blood clot formation takes longer, and therefore bleeding is prolonged. This deficiency causes a condition referred to as von Willebrand disease (VWD).
VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. It is a group of conditions associated with prolonged bleeding due to deficient and/or defective VWF. VWD is separated into different types and sub-types, including:

Type 1 – with this type of VWD, there is a decrease in the amount of VWF produced, but the VWF functions normally. Levels of factor VIII are also typically low but may be normal. This is the most common type of VWD, accounting for about 75% of cases. It tends to cause bruising and mild to moderate bleeding, such as persistent nosebleeds, heavy menstrual periods, and prolonged bleeding following childbirth, trauma, dental procedures, and surgeries. Symptoms and the severity of bleeding will vary from person to person and from episode to episode.
Type 2 – this type is associated with a normal amount of VWF, but the VWF does not function normally. Bleeding may be more severe with this with this type. Type 2 is further divided into Types 2A, 2B, 2M, and 2N.
Type 3 – this rare type is associated with very little VWF production, very low factor VIII levels, and moderate to severe symptoms. It is often detected in infancy because of early bleeding episodes.

Rarely, VWD may be due to an acquired VWF deficiency, where there is no family or personal bleeding history up to the point when signs and symptoms develop.
Von Willebrand factor testing includes VWF antigen, which measures the amount of VWF, and VWF activity (also known as Ristocetin Cofactor), which evaluates the function of VWF. Some laboratories may offer a panel that includes both of these tests along with a factor VIII activity test.

When you have a personal or family history of heavy, prolonged, and/or spontaneous bleeding; when your healthcare provider suspects that you may have a bleeding disorder


","



VWF testing is ordered after initial screening tests for a bleeding disorder (such as platelet function tests, PT, PTT) have been performed to investigate someone's personal or family history of excessive or recurrent bleeding episodes. The signs and symptoms that may prompt testing vary depending on the type of VWD an individual has and may include:

Frequent or repeated nose bleeds
Excessive bleeding from the gums after dental procedures
Excessive bruising after minor knocks or injuries
Heavy and/or prolonged menstrual bleeding in women
Blood in urine or stool
Prolonged bleeding after surgery


VWF tests may intermittently be normal in patients with VWD and should be repeated when they are initially normal but suspicions of VWD remain high. Repeat testing should be done after more than 2 weeks to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.
When VWF testing suggests VWD, additional testing may be performed to determine which subtype the person has.



","



Interpretation of VWF test results can be challenging and may require consultation with a doctor who specializes in bleeding disorders, such as a hematologist or coagulation specialist, especially when determining subtypes. People who have mild VWD may have normal VWF antigen and VWF activity test results, and people who do not have VWD may have moderately decreased test results.
In a person with normal or near normal bleeding disorder screening test results, a significantly decreased VWF antigen test suggests that the person tested has a quantitative VWF deficiency and may have Type 1 VWD or, more rarely, may have acquired VWD.
Using VWF antigen results along with the VWF activity (Ristocetin Cofactor) and factor VIII coagulant activity give the optimal combination for diagnosis and management. If the VWF antigen test is normal or nearly normal and the VWF activity (Ristocetin Cofactor) is decreased, then the person may have Type 2 VWD. Further testing (e.g., VWF multimeric analysis) will be required to determine which subtype is present.
If no or very little VWF and factor VIII are present, then the person may have Type 3 VWD. This will typically be seen in a child who experiences bleeding episodes early in life. It may appear to be due (or actually be due) to hemophilia A, a factor VIII deficiency bleeding disorder that affects males.
Increased concentrations of VWF antigen and VWF activity are not considered diagnostic. VWF is one of many acute phase reactants. This means that levels will be temporarily increased with infections, inflammation, trauma, and with physical and emotional stressors. They are also increased with pregnancy and with the use of estrogen medications such as oral contraceptives.



","



A person's ABO blood group affects VWF concentrations. People with type O blood have VWF levels that are up to 25% lower than those with other blood types.
Measuring levels of other acute phase reactants such as CRP and fibrinogen may be helpful if VWF levels are borderline normal. For example, a borderline normal VWF with significantly high CRP and/or fibrinogen may suggest VWD.
VWF is produced by megakaryocytes and by the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. It is released by platelets and endothelial cells as needed.



","



Von Willebrand factor (VWF) testing is used to investigate excessive or recurrent bleeding episodes or a personal or family history of excessive bleeding. Testing is used to help diagnose von Willebrand disease (VWD) and distinguish between the various types of VWD.
Two types of tests may be used:

VWF antigen – this test measures the amount of the VWF protein present in the blood.
VWF activity (also called Ristocetin Cofactor) – this test determines whether the protein is functioning properly.

These tests may be ordered by themselves or along with a coagulation factor VIII activity test and following other bleeding disorder tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), platelet count, platelet function tests (e.g., platelet aggregation, etc.), PT (prothrombin time), and/or PTT (partial thromboplastin time).
Other tests may be ordered following VWF testing for more information and to distinguish between subtypes. These may include:

Ratio of VWF:RCo to VWF:Ag
Factor VIII binding assay
Platelet VWF studies
Collagen binding activity assay
Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA) or platelet binding
VWF propeptide (VWFpp) to VWF antigen ratio
Molecular genetic testing for VWD (e.g., to confirm Type 2N and Type 3)
Multimeric analysis – VWF is a protein complex that exists as ""multimers"" of different size. This test looks at the distribution of different sizes to help distinguish between Type 2 subtypes.

To determine whether you have CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genetic variations and are likely to need lower, or less commonly, higher than average doses of the ""blood-thinning"" drug (anticoagulant) warfarin; however, not everyone who is prescribed warfarin will have this test done. At present, there is no consensus on the usefulness of this test and it is not yet widely accepted.

Warfarin (Coumadin®) is a ""blood-thinner"" (anticoagulant), a drug that is commonly prescribed to help prevent inappropriate blood clotting (thrombosis and thromboembolism) in individuals at risk. This includes people who have had a blood clot or who have an excessive clotting disorder, atrial fibrillation, an artificial heart valve, or have undergone orthopedic surgery.
Warfarin sensitivity testing helps determine if you may be more sensitive (i.e., require lower doses) to treatment with warfarin because of your genetic makeup. This test primarily detects common genetic variations in two genes, CYP2C9 and VKORC1. A healthcare practitioner may sometimes order this test to help select appropriate doses of warfarin and/or to achieve appropriate dose levels more quickly.
Warfarin can be a challenging drug to administer and monitor because its levels can be affected by many different factors and it has a narrow window in which it is effective. If you are given too little drug, you may be at risk of forming a blood clot; if given too much drug, you may be at risk of moderate to severe bleeding episodes. The range between too much drug and too little drug is small and it varies significantly from person to person.
Historically, healthcare practitioners have given warfarin doses based upon age, weight, and sex, and then have monitored and adjusted dosages using frequent PT/INR (prothrombin time/international normalized ratio) tests to determine the medication's anticoagulant (""blood-thinning"") effect. Healthcare practitioners then use periodic PT/INR tests to ensure that a stable dose with sufficient anticoagulation has been achieved. Although this dosing strategy is still commonly used, it can take as long as several weeks.
Genetic testing for warfarin sensitivity may help to shorten the time it takes for you to reach a stable dose; that is, to achieve adequate ""blood-thinning"" without bleeding episodes. Most often, it is determined that people are more sensitive to warfarin and may need smaller doses; however, there are some people who are less sensitive and may need larger doses. The reason for the relative sensitivity can be, at least in part, due to the individual's genetic makeup and may involve two genes:

The VKORC1 gene codes for the production of a protein (VKOR) that is involved in the production of functional forms of certain clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) that allows them to participate in the clotting process. Warfarin prevents the action of VKOR. Therefore, a variation in VKORC1 may cause you to be more or less sensitive (or resistant) to warfarin.
The CYP2C9 gene codes for the production of a protein (CYP2C9) involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of warfarin. People with CYP2C9 variations may not be able to get the drug out of their system as efficiently as others. The people who clear the drug more slowly may require lower (sometimes significantly lower) doses of warfarin.

You inherit one copy of each of your genes from your mother and one copy of each of your genes from your father. Thus, each of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes is present in your body as two inherited gene copies (alleles). You could have both copies of a gene without any variants (wild-type, normal); one copy without variants and one copy with a variant (heterozygous); both copies with the same variant (homozygous); and both copies with different variants (""compound heterozygous""). The combination of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene copies that you have can determine the overall effect of warfarin and how rapidly it is metabolized and cleared from your body.
Warfarin sensitivity (or warfarin genotype) testing determines whether CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants are present. Careful interpretation of the results can help the healthcare practitioner decide the appropriate doses of warfarin for your treatment.

A healthcare practitioner might order this test prior to prescribing warfarin for you or may sometimes order it when you are being treated with warfarin and have had bleeding or clotting episodes or dosing difficulties


","



Warfarin sensitivity testing may be ordered prior to you taking warfarin for the first time, but it may also be ordered when you have had difficulties with achieving a stable anticoagulant (""blood-thinning"") effect or have experienced either excessive blood clotting or bleeding while taking warfarin.



","



Warfarin sensitivity testing will identify the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants (i.e., genotype) present. Laboratories most commonly look for the CYP2C9 variant alleles *2 and *3.The results must be interpreted carefully to help determine if you are likely to need a relatively lower dose of warfarin. These results are often interpreted by a specialist. Some laboratories also test for other genes that may be involved in warfarin sensitivity and dose optimization (e.g., CYP4F2). The laboratory should provide information about any additional genes included in a test.
If you have one or more variant CYP2C9 or VKORC1 gene copies, you are more likely to need a lower dose of warfarin. The amount needed will depend on the number and type of genetic variants present but will also greatly depend upon other factors, including your health, age, sex, diet, and other medications.
This test detects only the most common genetic variants in CYP2C9 and VKORC1. You may have a rare variant, resulting in a negative test result, but may still be more sensitive or resistant to warfarin.



","



Some major health organizations support warfarin sensitivity testing, while others would like to see more data showing that the use of the testing actually has an impact on the health of the patient, such as a decrease in the number of clotting or bleeding events experienced by those on warfarin. Currently, there are studies underway that may provide additional data on health outcomes in the next few years, and that is likely to help determine the clinical usefulness of testing.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has created changes to the warfarin label to provide information about the usefulness of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic testing and to provide guidance on warfarin doses based upon testing results.
Many drugs interact with warfarin and can slow the metabolism of warfarin. Make sure all of your healthcare providers are aware of all the medications you are taking.



","



Warfarin sensitivity testing (genotyping) may be used to help determine your likely sensitivity to warfarin and to help select appropriate doses. Warfarin genotyping primarily identifies variations in the VKORC1 gene and the CYP2C9 gene. (See ""What is being tested?"" for more details on these genes.)
CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic testing is not widely used at this time. Although studies have shown that these genes contribute to a person's sensitivity to warfarin and can account for a significant percentage of the person-to-person variation in warfarin doses, there is not a consensus on the need for the testing yet.

To help diagnose an infection caused by West Nile virus (WNV); to determine the cause of viral meningitis or encephalitis or febrile illness that occurs during the summer season; to detect the presence of WNV and to track its spread in the community and across the United States; to screen for WNV in donated units of blood, tissues, or organs


","

Cerebrospinal fluid collected from a spinal tap and/or a blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm


","



West Nile virus (WNV) is an infection that is transmitted to humans primarily by mosquitoes that have bitten infected birds or other infected humans. Testing detects either the West Nile virus directly or antibodies produced in response to WNV infection in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
West Nile virus is a member of the Flavivirus family, which includes viruses such as Zika, Yellow Fever, and Dengue. WNV also belongs to the Arboviruses group, which are transmitted to people by insects, such as mosquitoes. In 2014, a total of 2,204 cases of WNV disease were reported in the United States, including 1,347 cases affecting the central nervous system (neuroinvasive). More than half of the detected infections were from states of California or Texas.
In addition to birds, WNV may also be transmitted through contact with other infected animals, their blood, or other tissues. The virus is not passed through handling or consumption of infected birds or directly from person-to-person; however, there have been rare cases of WNV being transmitted to others through blood donations, organ transplants, and from a mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or through breast milk.
About 80% of people infected with WNV experience no symptoms. In the other 20%, it causes flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, nausea, muscular weakness, and/or a skin rash on the back or chest. These symptoms usually resolve without treatment within a few days to a few weeks.
Only about 1 in 150 people infected with WNV becomes seriously ill with an infection that affects the central nervous system. These people may experience severe symptoms, such as confusion, convulsions, high fever, neck stiffness, headaches, or a coma. They may have encephalitis and/or meningitis and/or may experience muscular paralysis. This serious form of WNV is much more common in the elderly, people with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised), and individuals with underlying conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure (hypertension). While most symptoms resolve within several weeks, some nerve damage and paralysis may linger or be permanent.
The two types of WNV testing include:

Antibody testing—detects either IgM or IgG class of WNV antibodies
Nucleic acid amplification (NAAT)—detects the genetic material (RNA) of WNV

","

When you have symptoms suggesting WNV such as headache, fever, stiff neck, and muscular weakness and have been exposed to mosquitos or when you have had a diagnosis of encephalitis and/or meningitis associated with the summer season


","



Antibody tests are primarily ordered when a person has new signs and symptoms suggesting a current WNV infection, particularly if the person lives in or has traveled to an area where WNV is endemic. An infection may be suspected, especially if symptoms arise during the WNV season. In the United States, the peak mosquito season is generally July to October, but in some regions they may be present year-round.
Some signs and symptoms of WNV include:

Headache
Fever, chills
Nausea, vomiting
Muscular weakness
Skin rash on the back or chest
	 

Signs and symptoms associated with more serious WNV that has central nervous system involvement may include:

High fever
Extreme muscle weakness
Neck stiffness
Stupor (unresponsive, near unconscious), disorientation
Tremors, convulsions
Coma
Paralysis (rarely)
	 

Two to four weeks after a positive WNV test, IgM and IgG WNV tests may be ordered on a convalescent blood sample (from recovering patient). If an initial IgM test is negative but symptoms persist and other conditions are ruled out, another IgM test may be repeated a few days later to determine whether IgM WNV antibodies are now detectable.
Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) are routinely used to screen units of donated blood for WNV and may be performed on the blood of tissue and organ donors prior to transplantation.



","



Antibody Tests
If the IgM WNV antibody is positive in blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and confirmed by another method, then it is likely that the person has a current WNV infection, or that the person had one in the recent past. If the IgM antibody is detected in the CSF, it suggests that the WNV infection is present in the central nervous system.
If IgM WNV and IgG WNV antibodies are detected in the initial sample, then it is likely that the person contracted the WNV infection at least 3 weeks prior to the test. If the IgG WNV antibody is positive and the IgM WNV antibody level is low or not detectable, then it is most likely that the person was previously exposed to WNV but is not currently infected. If WNV IgG antibody titers in convalescent samples continue to rise, this change would indicate a more recent infection. If the WNV IgG antibody levels have not changed or have decreased, this would indicate a past but not recent infection.
The following table summarizes results that may be seen with WNV antibody testing:



IgM Result
IgG Result
Possible Interpretation


Positive
Negative
Current infection

Recent infection


Low or negative or not tested
Four-fold increase in samples collected 2-4 weeks apart
Recent infection

Past infection


Negative

Symptoms due to another cause





The presence of WNV antibodies may indicate an infection but cannot be used to predict the severity of an individual person's symptoms or their prognosis.
Due to the possibility of false-positive results due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies with other viruses, or non-specific reaction, all positive WNV antibody tests are usually confirmed using another test. The confirmatory test (neutralization antibody test) is performed at specialized laboratories, such as state public health or CDC laboratories. The neutralization antibody test confirms whether the detected antibodies are capable of binding and inactivating the WNV. Viral cultures and immunohistochemistry can also be used to detect WNV, although they are not used in routine testing.
Nucleic Acid AmplificationTesting (NAAT)
If a NAAT is positive for WNV, then it is likely that the virus is present in the sample tested (donated blood; blood from a donor; CSF; a tissue sample from a human, bird, or other animal; or a mosquito pool sample) and is present in the geographic location where the sample was collected.
A NAAT may be negative for WNV if there is no virus present in the sample tested or if the virus is present in very low (undetectable) numbers. A negative test cannot be used to definitely rule out the presence of WNV. A NAAT may detect WNV as long as the virus is actively replicating in the person. 



","



In some warm areas, WNV is present year-round, but in most regions, it is seasonal: cases occur during the mosquito season. The amount of WNV present depends in part on the number of infected birds and the mosquito population. Prevention depends on controlling individual exposure and on controlling the mosquito population.
For the most current numbers of confirmed human cases of WNV in the U.S. and the number of deaths attributed to it as the cause, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's West Nile Virus web site. 
NAAT and viral cultures are used in research settings to identify and subtype the strain of virus causing the infection and to study its attributes. These tests are important in studying the spread and sometimes the source of infections or epidemics. Different strains of WNV have been isolated and associated with different epidemics around the world.



","



West Nile virus (WNV) testing is used to help determine whether a person with signs and symptoms and a history of recent exposure has an acute WNV infection. WNV is an infection that is transmitted to humans primarily by mosquitoes that have bitten infected birds or other infected humans. Testing of symptomatic and seriously ill people can help distinguish WNV from other conditions causing similar symptoms, such as bacterial meningitis, and can help guide treatment.
WNV testing is also used to ensure donated blood is free of WNV. In 2016, 288 blood donors, who were otherwise asymptomatic, were identified as WNV-positive when screened for the virus. 45 of those donors developed clinical illness with WNV disease.
Testing is not used for screening asymptomatic people. The majority of those who become infected with WNV (about 80%) will have no symptoms and no associated health problems, so testing is not useful in these cases.
Two types of WNV tests are available:
Antibody Tests
Antibody testing is primarily used to help diagnose a current or recent infection. There are two classes of WNV antibodies produced in response to infection: IgM and IgG.

IgM antibodies are the first to be produced by the immune system in response to a WNV infection. They are present in most individuals within a week or two of the initial exposure. The level of antibody (titer) continues to rise for a short time period and then will taper off. Eventually, after several months, the IgM antibodies fall below detectable levels. 

	IgM WNV antibody testing is the primary test performed on the blood or cerebrospinal fluid of symptomatic people. The WNV tests available may be positive both with WNV and with any related arboviruses, such as the St. Louis Encephalitis virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus. For this reason, most positive WNV IgM tests must be confirmed by another method before a diagnosis is established and officially reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
	 
Testing for WNV IgG antibodies can sometimes be used in conjunction with IgM testing to help detect the presence of a recent or previous WNV infection. The IgG WNV test may be ordered once with the IgM test or ordered initially and then again 2-4 weeks later to determine if titers are rising or falling.
	 

Nucleic Acid AmplificationTest
A nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) amplifies and measures the West Nile virus's genetic material to detect the presence of the virus. This test can detect a current infection with the virus often before antibodies to the virus are detectable. While it can specifically identify the presence of WNV, there must be a certain amount (number of copies) of virus present in the sample in order to detect it.
Since humans are secondary hosts of WNV (birds are the primary hosts), virus levels in humans are usually relatively low and do not persist for very long.
Nucleic acid testing is most useful as a screen for WNV in donated units of blood, tissue, or organs, for detecting WNV in the blood of living tissue and organ donors, and for testing birds and mosquito pools to detect the presence and spread of WNV in the community. It is possible to determine that WNV has spread to a particular area and is in the bird and mosquito population before any human cases are identified. It also may be used to test the blood or tissues of a person who has died (post mortem) to determine whether WNV may have caused or contributed to their death.

White blood cells, also called leukocytes, are cells that exist in the blood, the lymphatic system, and tissues and are an important part of the body's defense system. They help protect against infections and also have a role in inflammation, and allergic reactions. The white blood cell (WBC) count totals the number of white blood cells in a sample of your blood. It is one test among several that is included in a complete blood count (CBC), which is often used in the general evaluation of your health.
Blood is made up of three main types of cells suspended in fluid called plasma. In addition to WBCs, there are red blood cells and platelets. All of these cells are made in the bone marrow and are released into the blood to circulate.
There are five types of WBCs, and each has a different function:

Three types of WBCs are referred to as ""granulocytes"" because of the granules present in their cytoplasm. These granules release chemicals and other substances as part of the immune response. Granulocytes include:

	
Neutrophils (neu) normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue, where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi.
Eosinophils (eos) respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation.
Basophils (baso) usually make up the fewest number of circulating WBCs and are thought to be involved in allergic reactions.


Lymphocytes (lymphs) exist in both the blood and the lymphatic system. They are divided into three types:
	
B lymphocytes (B cells) produce antibodies as part of the body’s natural defense (immune) responses.
T lymphocytes (T cells) recognize foreign substances and process them for removal.
Natural killer cells (NK cells) directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.


Monocytes (mono), similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated more often with chronic rather than acute infections.

When there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs, releasing them into the blood, and through a complex process, they move to the site of infection or inflammation. As the condition resolves, the production of WBCs by the bone marrow subsides and the number of WBCs drops to normal levels again.
In addition to infections and inflammation, there are a number of conditions that can affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or the survival of WBCs in the blood, such as cancer or an immune disorder, resulting in either increased or decreased numbers of WBCs in the blood. The WBC count, along with the other components of the CBC, alerts a healthcare practitioner to possible health issues. Results are often interpreted in conjunction with additional tests, such as a WBC differential and a blood smear review. A differential may provide information on which type of WBC may be low or high, and a blood smear may show the presence of abnormal and/or immature WBCs.
If results indicate a problem, a wide variety of other tests can be performed to help determine the cause. A healthcare practitioner will typically consider an individual's signs and symptoms, medical history, and results of a physical examination to decide what other tests may be necessary. For example, as needed, a bone marrow biopsy will be performed to evaluate the bone marrow status.

A WBC count is normally ordered as part of the complete blood count (CBC), which may be performed when you have a routine health examination. The test may be done when you have general signs and symptoms of an infection and/or inflammation, such as:

Body aches, pain
Headache
A variety of other signs and symptoms, depending on the site of suspected infection or inflammation
	 

Testing may be performed when there are signs and symptoms that a healthcare practitioner thinks may be related to a blood disorder, autoimmune disorder, or an immune deficiency.
A WBC may be ordered on a regular basis when you have been diagnosed with an infection, blood or immune disorder or another condition affecting the number and types of WBCs. It may also be ordered periodically when you are receiving treatment for one of these conditions or when you are receiving radiation or chemotherapy.



","



A WBC count indicates an overall increase or decrease in the number of white blood cells. A healthcare practitioner will consider the results of a WBC count together with results from other components of the complete blood count (CBC) as well as a number of other factors, such as physical examination, medical history, and signs and symptoms.
A high white blood cell count, called leukocytosis, may result from a number of conditions and diseases. Some examples include:

Infections, most commonly caused by bacteria and some viruses, less commonly by fungi or parasites
Inflammation or inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis or inflammatory bowel disease
Leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms
Conditions that result in tissue death (necrosis) such as trauma, burns, surgery or heart attack
Allergic responses (e.g., allergies, asthma)
	 

A low white blood cell count, called leukopenia, can result from conditions such as:

Bone marrow damage (e.g., toxin, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, drugs)
Bone marrow disorders—the bone marrow does not produce sufficient WBCs (e.g., myelodysplastic syndrome, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency)
Lymphoma or other cancer that has spread (metastasized) to the bone marrow
Autoimmune disorders—the body attacks and destroys its own WBCs (e.g., lupus)
Dietary deficiencies (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency)
Overwhelming infections (e.g., sepsis)
Diseases of the immune system, such as HIV, which destroy T lymphocytes
	 

When WBC counts are used for monitoring medical conditions, a series of WBC counts that continues to rise or fall to abnormal levels indicates that the condition or disease is getting worse. WBC counts that return to normal indicate improvement and/or successful treatment.



","



Intense exercise or severe emotional or physical stress can increase a WBC count, but the test is not used to evaluate these conditions. Pregnancy in the final month and labor may also be associated with increased WBC levels.
In the U.S. population, WBC counts are related to one's age, sex, ethnicity, and smoking status. It is not uncommon for the elderly to fail to develop high WBC count (leukocytosis) as a response to infection.
There are many types of medications (prescription and over the counter) that cause both increased and decreased WBC counts.



","



The white blood cell count (WBC) is used as part of a full complete blood count (CBC) to:

Screen for a wide range of diseases and conditions
Help diagnose an infection or inflammatory process or other diseases that affect the number of WBCs, such as allergies, leukemia or immune disorders, to name a few.
Monitor the progression of conditions such as those named above
Monitor the body's response to various treatments and/or to monitor bone marrow function; some treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, are known to affect white cells and may be monitored using WBC counts.


A WBC count can be used to detect is a disease or condition affecting white blood cells, but it cannot determine the underlying cause. Several other tests may be done help make a diagnosis, such as a WBC differential, a blood smear review, or in severe conditions, a bone marrow examination. A differential may indicate which type of WBC is low or high while a blood smear and/or bone marrow biopsy can reveal the presence of abnormal and/or immature WBCs.

White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes, are cells that circulate in the blood and the lymphatic system that help protect the body against infections. They are an important part of the body's immune system and also have a role in inflammation, allergies, and protection against cancer. A WBC differential categorizes the numbers of each of the different types of WBCs in sample of your blood.
There are five main types of white blood cells, each with different functions. The differential shows if:

The different types of WBCs are present in normal proportion to one another
The numbers of the different cell types are normal, increased or decreased
Abnormal and/or immature WBCs are present

This information is helpful in diagnosing specific types of illnesses that affect the immune system and the bone marrow.
A differential may be performed along with or following a complete blood count (CBC), a test often used as a general health check, or it may be performed in follow-up to abnormal results on a CBC. Most often, a differential is performed on an automated blood analyzer. Occasionally, it is performed manually by a trained laboratory professional who examines a blood smear using a microscope. 
Types of White Blood Cells
The bone marrow produces five main types of WBCs, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.

Neutrophils (neu) normally make up the largest number of circulating WBCs. They move into an area of damaged or infected tissue, where they engulf and destroy bacteria or sometimes fungi.
Lymphocytes (lymphs) exist in both the blood and the lymphatic system. They are broadly divided into three types, but the differential does not distinguish among them. The differential counts and reports all lymphocytes together. Separate specialized testing (like immunophenotyping) must be done to differentiate the three types:
	
B lymphocytes (B cells) are produce antibodies that help protect against infections. Plasma cells are fully differentiated B-cells that produce antibodies, immune proteins that target and destroy bacteria, viruses and other ""non-self"" foreign antigens.
T lymphocytes (T cells) finish maturing in the thymus and consist of a few different types. Some T cells help the body distinguish between ""self"" and ""non-self"" antigens. Others initiate and control the extent of an immune response, boosting it as needed and then slowing it as the condition resolves. Other types of T cells directly attack and neutralize virus-infected or cancerous cells.
Natural killer cells (NK cells) directly attack and kill abnormal cells such as cancer cells or those infected with a virus.


Monocytes (mono), similar to neutrophils, move to an area of infection and engulf and destroy bacteria. They are associated more often with long-term (chronic) rather than acute infections. They are also involved in tissue repair and other functions involving the immune system.
Eosinophils (eos) respond to infections caused by parasites, play a role in allergic reactions (hypersensitivities), and control the extent of immune responses and inflammation.
Basophils (baso) usually make up the fewest number of circulating WBCs and are thought to be involved in allergic reactions.

What does a differential tell you?
A WBC differential can give clues about your condition or what is causing a low or high WBC count. When there is an infection or an inflammatory process somewhere in the body, the bone marrow produces more WBCs, releasing them into the blood. Depending on the cause of infection or inflammation, one particular type of WBC may be increased as opposed to other types. As the condition resolves, the bone marrow produces fewer of that type of WBC and the number drops back to normal levels.
In addition to infections and inflammation, there are a variety of conditions that can affect the production of WBCs by the bone marrow or their survival in the blood, resulting in either increased or decreased numbers. The differential, along with the other components of the CBC, alerts the healthcare provider to possible health issues. Results are often interpreted along with additional tests such as a blood smear exam, which can show the presence of abnormal and/or immature WBCs.
In a few serious diseases, some immature forms of the cells are released from the bone marrow into the circulation and may be detected by the WBC differential. This may occur with bacterial infection, leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or myeloproliferative neoplasms, for example. Some immature cells that may be detected include metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes, and/or blasts.
If results indicate a problem, a wide variety of other tests may be performed in order to help determine the cause. A healthcare provider will typically consider your signs and symptoms, medical history, and results of a physical examination to decide what other tests may be necessary. For example, as needed, a bone marrow biopsy might be performed because that is where WBCs normally are produced and where they mature.

You may have a complete blood count (CBC) and WBC differential (CBC with diff) when you go for a routine health exam.

Testing may be performed when you have signs and symptoms that your healthcare provider thinks may be related to a blood and/or bone marrow disorder, autoimmune disease or other immune disorder.
If a differential is not done at the same time as a CBC, it may be ordered when results from the CBC are not within the reference ranges.



","



WBC differential results indicate the number and/or the percentage of each type of white blood cell that is present in your sample of blood at the time of the test.
Results of a differential are usually reported as absolute values of the five types of WBCs and/or may be reported as a percent of the total number of WBCs. Absolute values are calculated by multiplying the total number of WBCs by the percentage of each type of white cell. In adults, neutrophils typically make up the highest number of WBCs, followed by lymphocytes, then monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. In young children, lymphocytes are often more numerous than neutrophils.
When interpreting your results of a differential, your healthcare provider will consider several factors, including your signs and symptoms and medical history as well as how high or low each type of WBC is and whether the increase or decrease persists. 

A number of factors can cause a temporary rise or drop in the number of any one type of WBC. A persistent increase or decrease will usually prompt your healthcare practitioner to order more testing to determine the cause.
A result that is barely outside the reference range may or may not be significant for you while a large rise or drop in one or more types of WBCs usually prompts more testing.

Pertussis, commonly called whooping cough, is a respiratory infection caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. These bacteria are highly contagious and are passed from person to person through coughing and sneezing and close contact. Whooping cough tests are performed to detect and diagnose infection with B. pertussis.
The time between infection with the bacteria and developing signs and symptoms (incubation period) varies from a few days to up to three weeks. B. pertussis typically causes a prolonged, three-stage infection:

Catarrhal Stage: This is the first stage of the disease, which usually lasts about one to two weeks. Symptoms may resemble a mild cold, with runny nose, low-grade fever and an occasional cough. Infants may develop apnea (a pause in breathing) during this stage and may be more prone to choking. Individuals are highly contagious during this time.
Paroxysmal Stage: This is the second stage of infection, which may last for one to two weeks or persist for a couple of months, and is characterized by severe bouts of coughing. Coughing is frequently followed by a 'whoop' sound and patients may feel exhausted and/or vomit after these coughing fits.
Convalescent Stage: During the third stage, the frequency and severity of the coughing starts to lessen and decreases over the next two to three weeks.

Whooping cough can sometimes lead to complications requiring hospitalization, particularly for infants, and may include apnea (61%) or pneumonia (23%), or much less frequently convulsions (1%), brain disease or damage (encephalopathy) (about 0.3%) or death (1%).
Whooping cough used to be very common in the United States, affecting about 200,000 people during outbreaks that would occur every few years. Since the introduction of a whooping cough vaccine and widespread vaccination of infants, this number has drastically decreased. For details on the whooping cough vaccine, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Pertussis: Summary of Vaccine Recommendations.
Importantly, prior infection or receipt of the complete vaccination series for whooping cough do not prevent you from becoming infected as they do not provide lifetime immunity or protection from re-infection. Fully vaccinated individuals who are infected with B. pertussis may develop a less severe infection, with persistent coughing but without the classic paroxysmal cough.
Periodic outbreaks of whooping cough in unvaccinated infants, in adolescents, and in adults still occur in the United States. According to the CDC, 10,000 to 40,000 cases of whooping cough are reported each year. Over 48,000 cases of whooping cough were reported in 2012, the most recent peak year, and many more likely went unreported.
Diagnostic tests for whooping cough
Because the initial symptoms of whooping cough, especially during the catarrhal stage, are frequently indistinguishable from those of a common cold or of other respiratory illnesses, such as bronchitis, influenza (flu), or in children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), diagnostic testing is necessary to help identify the infection.
There are a few test methods that may be used to detect whooping cough, and the type of testing your healthcare practitioner orders is largely dependent on how long you have had symptoms.

Bacterial culture – if the B. pertussis bacteria are present in your sample, this test will grow them on an agar plate. It may take up to 7 days for the bacteria to grow; however, the bacteria may be less likely to grow if you have been treated with certain antibiotics before the sample was collected. Culture testing is most useful in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset. If necessary, bacteria that grow in culture may be used for susceptibility testing to identify the optimal antibiotic to use.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – this test detects genetic material (e.g., DNA) from the bacteria. The test can be completed within a couple of hours. PCR can detect genetic material from the bacteria from the time of initial symptom onset to approximately 3-4 weeks later.
Blood test for antibodies (i.e., IgA, IgG, IgM) to pertussis (serology) – these tests detect antibodies produced by the body's immune system in response to B. pertussis. Antibody testing is not the preferred test because it is an indirect method to identify the infection. This type of testing is most useful in patients with more than 3-4 weeks of symptoms. According to the CDC, serology can be used from 2 to 8 weeks after the cough starts, and in some cases may be helpful up to 12 weeks after onset.

How is the sample collected for testing?
Proper collection of the appropriate samples is essential for accurate whooping cough test results.
For bacterial culture or testing by PCR, a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or nasal aspirate is collected. For tests to detect antibodies to the bacteria, a blood sample is needed.

The nasopharyngeal swab is collected by having you tip your head back and then a swab (like a long Q-tip with a small head) is gently inserted through one of your nostrils until resistance is met. It is left in place for several seconds, then rotated several times to collect cells, and withdrawn. This is not painful, but it may tickle, cause your eyes to tear, and provoke a coughing spell.
For a nasal aspirate, a syringe is used to insert a small amount of sterile saline into the nasal passage and then gentle suction is applied to collect the resulting fluid.
For antibody testing, a blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm.

When you have ongoing spasms or fits of coughing (paroxysms) that your healthcare practitioner suspects are due to whooping cough (pertussis)
When you have symptoms of a cold and have been exposed to someone with whooping cough



",,"



PCR test:

A positive PCR test means that genetic material (i.e., DNA) from B. pertussis was detected in your specimen, indicating that you have been infected. However, the PCR test may also be positive with other Bordetella species.
A negative PCR test means that it is less likely that you have whooping cough but does not rule it out. If there are very few bacteria present in the sample, they may not be detected by PCR.

Culture:

A positive culture is diagnostic for whooping cough.
Similar to PCR, a negative culture does not rule out whooping cough. Culture results are dependent on proper specimen collection and transport, how long you have had symptoms prior to collection, and whether there was any prior antibiotic treatment before the sample was collected.

Both culture and PCR tests are less likely to be positive as the illness progresses.
With blood testing, pertussis IgG antibodies will be present in those who have been vaccinated or have had a past infection. IgM and IgA antibodies may indicate recent vaccination or infection and will only be present for a short period of time (2-3 months). Blood testing is not typically recommended for the diagnosis of active whooping cough and is most useful after approximately 3-4 weeks of symptoms.



","



Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) is a testing method that is no longer recommended or routinely available in clinical laboratories to detect whooping cough. This method is less specific and less sensitive than either the culture or PCR methods.

widal-test,,,,,"



The Widal test is one method that may be used to help make a presumptive diagnosis of enteric fever, also known as typhoid fever. Although the test is no longer commonly performed in the United States or other developed countries, it is still in use in many emerging nations where enteric fever is endemic and limited resources require the use of rapid, affordable testing alternatives. While the method is easy to perform, concerns remain about the reliability of the Widal test. It is not specific for typhoid fever and can be positive when a person does not have the infection.
Enteric fever is a life-threatening illness caused by infection with the bacterium Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. typhi), usually transmitted through food and drinks contaminated with fecal matter. It is associated with symptoms that include high fever, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, weight loss, and a rash known as ""rose spots."" Early diagnosis and treatment are important because serious complications, including severe intestinal bleeding or perforation, can develop within a few weeks.
The infection is rare in the U.S. and other industrialized nations but is more common in developing countries, including India, parts of South, East and Southeast Asia, and countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Eastern Europe. Cases of enteric fever in the U.S. are usually attributed to travelers to these endemic areas.
In the U.S. and other developed nations, testing for enteric fever usually involves a blood culture to detect the bacteria during the first week of fever. A stool, urine or bone marrow culture may also be performed. A blood culture, however, can be labor- and time-intensive in areas of the world that lack the resources for automated equipment. In developing countries, such as those in Africa, the Widal test continues to be used instead of cultures because it is quicker, simpler, and less costly to perform.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that due to the various factors that can influence the results of a Widal test, it is best not to rely too much on this test. WHO instead recommends the use of cultures, whenever possible. Until another simple, inexpensive, and reliable option becomes available, however, use of the Widal test will probably persist in those countries with limited resources. There are newer rapid antibody tests for typhoid fever commercially available, several of which have been included in comparative studies of their reliability, for example in India and Africa. Findings seem to vary as to whether any are as reliable as blood culture for diagnosing this infection.

Fast for 8 hours and avoid foods high in pentose, such as jams, fruits, and pastries, for 24 hours prior to the test. Ask your healthcare provider if there are any changes to your medications that you should make.


","

To help evaluate your ability to absorb carbohydrates and help determine the cause of malabsorption


","

Timed blood samples drawn from a vein in your arm and timed urine collection


","



Xylose (d-xylose) is a simple sugar (carbohydrate) that is usually easily absorbed by the body. This test determines how well someone absorbs xylose. It measures the level of xylose in the blood and urine after a standard amount is ingested in order to evaluate the person's ability to absorb carbohydrates in general.
The body digests foods in three stages: first proteins, fats, and carbohydrates are broken down in the stomach by acids and enzymes and then in the small intestines by pancreatic enzymes and bile from the liver. They are then absorbed, primarily in the small intestines, and finally the nutrients are transported throughout the body and used or stored.
If there are not enough bile or pancreatic enzymes available, then carbohydrates and other foods cannot be properly digested. If a condition prevents the intestines from absorbing the nutrients, then they are lost by excretion in the stool. In both cases—improper digestion or absorption—the affected person can experience symptoms associated with malabsorption and, in severe cases, symptoms of malnutrition and vitamin deficiency.
This test is not routinely ordered and not widely available. Several major health organizations, including the American Gastroenterology Association, the World Gastroenterology Organization, and the British Society of Gastroenterology, do not include this test in their guidelines for evaluating possible malabsorption.
How is the sample collected for testing?
The xylose absorption test is a procedure that involves fasting prior to testing and emptying the bladder at the beginning of testing (this urine is not saved).
A fasting blood sample is obtained by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm and then the person is given a standard dose of xylose dissolved in water to drink. Typically, the dose is 25 grams of xylose, but if the person is unable to tolerate this amount, then a 5-gram dose may be used. For children, the dose is adjusted by weight. The person is then asked to rest quietly. Another blood sample is collected at 2 hours (1 hour for a child).
All urine is collected for 5 hours, starting from the time the dose is given.
The fasting blood, timed blood, and 5-hour urine samples are then tested for xylose.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
Fast for 8 hours and avoid foods high in pentose, such as jams, fruits, and pastries, for 24 hours prior to the test. Ask your healthcare provider if there are any necessary medication changes.

Fatty stools that are loose and foul-smelling (steatorrhea)
Persistent diarrhea
Abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, and gas
Weight loss
Failure to thrive (in children)

Testing may be ordered when a healthcare practitioner wants to determine whether a patient's intestines are absorbing carbohydrates normally and/or wants to distinguish between different possible causes of malabsorption.



","



With the xylose absorption testing procedure, high blood and urine levels of xylose are normal. They indicate good xylose absorption by the intestines. This suggests that the tested person's symptoms are likely due to another cause, such as pancreatic insufficiency or bile insufficiency.
High blood levels but low urine levels may be seen in someone with kidney dysfunction. In this case, it is the blood levels that will be used to evaluate the individual for malabsorption.
Low levels of blood and urine xylose indicate poor absorption. A variety of conditions that affect digestion and absorption may cause decreased xylose levels. These may include bacterial overgrowth in the intestines, parasitic infections, a shortened bowel (such as from surgery) and celiac disease.
Depending upon a person's clinical situation, an abnormal xylose absorption test may be followed by additional blood or stool tests to try to isolate the cause and/or by a small-bowel biopsy to look at intestinal cells.



","



Several drugs can affect test results, including aspirin, digitalis, MAO inhibitors, metformin, nalidixic acid, opium alkaloids, atropine, and indomethacin.
Dehydration, exercise, and the rate that the stomach empties may affect test results.
Some people may experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea from the xylose dose.



",,"



The xylose absorption test may be ordered to help determine whether a person is absorbing carbohydrates normally and to distinguish between malabsorption disorders caused by insufficient pancreatic enzymes or bile and those due to dysfunction of the intestines.
It may be ordered as a follow-up test if other test results, such as fecal fat, suggest malabsorption but do not reveal its cause.
This is not a routine test. Its use and availability has declined over time. Major health organizations, including the American Gastroenterology Association, the World Gastroenterology Organization, and the British Society of Gastroenterology, do not include this test in their guidelines for evaluating possible malabsorption.

To diagnose a Zika virus infection


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein in your arm and/or a urine sample collected in a clean container; less commonly cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or amniotic fluid


","



Zika is a viral infection that is spread primarily by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes and less commonly by sexual transmission. Testing detects the genetic material (RNA) of the Zika virus in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or amniotic fluid or detects antibodies in the blood produced in response to Zika virus infection. 
About 80% of individuals infected with Zika virus will have no symptoms at all, while others will have only mild illness. For people who do develop symptoms, prognosis is very good for full recovery. The most common initial symptoms of Zika include fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye) lasting from a few days to a week. These symptoms are similar to other mosquito-borne illnesses like dengue fever and chikungunaya. The similarities between Zika symptoms and other diseases mean that laboratory testing is essential to diagnosing Zika virus.
Zika virus infection is typically diagnosed with blood and urine tests. Laboratory tests may include either molecular tests for Zika virus (PCR), which detect the presence of the virus itself, or an antibody test that detects antibodies produced by the immune system after a person has been exposed to the virus. 
Since the first human case of Zika virus in 1952, outbreaks have been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Zika was found in Brazil in May 2015, representing the virus' first introduction to the Americas. Since then, it has rapidly spread through the Americas. Check the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) web page for updates and more information about Zika virus status in the U.S.
While most people infected with the Zika virus do not develop noticeable or severe symptoms, it can cause risk of serious complications for a pregnant woman and her unborn child, including miscarriage and birth defects. Starting in May 2015, Brazilian health officials reported an increase in Zika infections along with an uptick in babies born with microcephaly (smaller than expected heads). Since the outbreak that started in Brazil, the CDC has confirmed that Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause severe microcephaly and other birth defects.
Babies with microcephaly have much smaller heads than normal and severe microcephaly causes a range of lifelong problems, including developmental disabilities, seizures, hearing loss, and vision loss. Scientists are still learning about other impacts of Zika infection during pregnancy. If you are pregnant or considering pregnancy, the CDC web page has up-to-date recommendations on how to protect yourself.
In rare cases, Zika virus is also linked to the development of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body to attack its own nervous system, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Researchers are still working to understand what causes GBS, but most people with GBS develop it after a viral or bacterial infection. The CDC is still investigating the relationship between Zika and GBS.
In January 2016, the CDC issued a travel alert for areas of the world where Zika virus is circulating. The alert recommends that pregnant women avoid travel to certain areas with Zika, and that women considering pregnancy consult their healthcare providers before traveling to those areas. There is currently no vaccine or treatment for Zika virus. Avoiding Aedes mosquito bites is the best way to prevent a Zika infection.
Since information about Zika is changing quickly, check the CDC's web site for the latest on the virus.
How is the sample collected for testing?
A blood sample is collected by inserting a needle into a vein in the arm. A urine sample is collected by voiding into a clean container. Sometimes, a healthcare practitioner may collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid or amniotic fluid.
Is any test preparation needed to ensure the quality of the sample?
No test preparation is needed.

When you develop a fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye) after traveling to an area where Zika virus is endemic or have symptoms and had sexual contact with someone who recently traveled from an area where Zika is present; if you are pregnant and have traveled to an area where Zika is active, regardless of symptoms; or when a baby is born with microcephaly (small head)


","



Zika testing may be ordered when an individual has signs and symptoms associated with Zika infection and recently traveled to areas where the virus is actively spread by mosquitos or had sexual contact with someone who recently traveled from an area where Zika is present.
Signs and symptoms of Zika typically last between 2 and 7 days. Some of the main signs and symptoms include:

Fever
Joint pain
Rash
Conjunctivitis (pink eye)
Headache
	 

According to CDC guidelines, asymptomatic pregnant women who have recently traveled to an area with active Zika transmission may be offered the antibody test. Pregnant women who have had sexual contact with a recent traveler to a country with Zika may also be tested.
Testing may be performed when a newborn has microcephaly (an abnormally small head). If a person has Guillain-Barre syndrome and is at risk for Zika virus, that person may be tested.



","



Molecular testing

A PCR test that detects the RNA of the virus is generally considered the most reliable means of diagnosis. A positive PCR result for Zika is considered conclusive. All positive results should be reported to the state public health department.
A negative PCR result may indicate that no infection is present or that the level of virus is too low to detect. This can happen if the blood test is performed after the 7-day window and/or the urine test is performed after the 2 to 3-week window during which the virus is present in the sample. The CDC recommends that antibody testing be done following a negative PCR result (see below).
	 

Antibody testing

A positive IgM test for Zika antibodies is followed by a second test called the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT), which is used to confirm the presence of antibodies to Zika virus. No patient management decisions should be made based on IgM blood tests (serology) alone until the PRNT is completed because of the risk of false-positive results. A PRNT positive for Zika virus and negative for dengue virus is indicative of recent Zika virus infection.
Negative tests for IgM antibodies do not rule out the possibility of Zika virus infection. A negative result may mean that the individual tested does not have a Zika infection and symptoms are due to another cause. It may also mean that the level of antibody may be too low to measure. The person may still have a Zika infection; it may just be that it is too soon after initial exposure to the virus to produce a detectable level of antibody. Early in the infectious process before the production of antibodies, PCR testing (above) may be performed when testing is done within 7 days of illness.
	 

Since information about Zika is changing quickly, check the CDC's web site for the latest on the virus and testing.



","



Tests for the Zika virus or antibodies do not provide any information about fetal health in pregnant women with Zika virus.
Physical symptoms like rash or aching joints are not a reliable means for diagnosing Zika because the symptoms are not specific to Zika.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has directed blood collection facilities to screen all donated blood and blood components for the Zika virus. The FDA approved two investigational tests for this purpose. The tests were approved under an ""investigational new device (IND)"" protocol and did not go through the standard regulatory process prior to implementation, which can be time-consuming. The tests screen for the presence of the virus by detecting its genetic material (RNA). Units of blood that test positive for the virus are removed from the supply and not used for transfusions.



",,"



Zika virus testing is used to detect a Zika infection in a person without signs and symptoms and to determine whether a person with signs and symptoms of Zika has been infected after exposure in a region with Zika virus. It may also be used to test people who have had sexual contact with a recent traveler to a country with Zika. 
Zika infection may be difficult to diagnose without laboratory tests because symptoms may resemble those of other diseases, such as dengue fever or chikungunya infection, or the patient may be asymptomatic. Currently, two types of testing are available:

Molecular tests for Zika virus (PCR)—these detect the presence of the RNA of the virus and can diagnose Zika infection if tested within a week after the onset of symptoms. One type of Real Time RT-PCR test can detect Zika and the two other mosquito-borne viruses, dengue and chikungunya, and distinguish between the three. This test can be used on blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), amniotic fluid, or urine samples.

	Molecular tests of blood are not likely to detect Zika after 7 days of illness. Urine testing can detect Zika RNA for at least two weeks after symptoms begin. According to a recent study, urine may be the preferred specimen for detecting Zika RNA during the first three weeks of illness. If urine and blood specimens are taken less than 7 days after the onset of illness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing both samples.
If the result of a PCR test is negative, an antibody test can be used to help establish a diagnosis, according to the CDC (see below).
	 

Antibody blood tests—these detect the IgM class of antibodies produced by the immune system when a person has been exposed to the virus. An antibody test may be used following a negative result on a PCR test or as alternative test for individuals who may have been infected but the length of time has passed when PCR can be performed. IgM antibodies appear in the blood 4 to 5 days after the start of the illness and last for about 12 weeks. Performing the test outside this window can yield false-negative results.
	IgM antibody tests can be positive if a person has been infected with a similar virus, such as dengue (called cross-reaction). If an initial IgM antibody test is positive, a second test called the Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) is used to confirm the presence of antibodies to Zika virus and to help rule out other viral infections.
	 


The amount of time that it takes for test results to become available can vary depending on where the person being tested is located and whether the state public health laboratory is performing Zika testing. Some samples may need to be sent to the CDC for testing. In general, it may take about three weeks for results, according to the CDC.

zinc-protoporphyrin,"['ZPP', 'ZP', 'Free Erythrocyte Protoporphyrin', 'FEP', 'ZPP/Heme Ratio']","

","

To screen for and monitor chronic exposure to lead in adults; to detect iron deficiency in children


","

A blood sample drawn from a vein or from a fingerstick


","



Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is normally present in red blood cells in small amounts, but the level may increase in people with lead poisoning and iron deficiency. This test measures the level of ZPP in the blood.
To understand how lead poisoning and iron deficiency affect the ZPP level, it is necessary to know about heme. Heme is an essential component of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and cells.
Heme formation occurs in a series of steps that concludes with the insertion of an iron atom into the center of a molecule called protoporphyrin. When there is not enough iron available, as in iron deficiency, or when the insertion of iron is inhibited, as in lead poisoning, then protoporphyrin combines with zinc instead of iron to form zinc protoporphyrin. ZPP serves no useful purpose in red blood cells since it cannot bind to oxygen.
Erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) accumulates in red blood cells when there is insufficient iron present for proper heme synthesis. A small percentage of EP may be unbound and can be measured as free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), with the remainder EP (about 90%) measured as zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP).

When you have been chronically exposed to lead, as part of a program to monitor industrial lead exposure, and/or when your healthcare provider suspects lead poisoning; as part of screening and diagnosing iron deficiency in children and adolescents


","



ZPP may be ordered along with a lead test when chronic exposure to lead is known or suspected in adults. Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning include:

High blood pressure
Numbness and/or tingling in the hands and feet
Memory loss, mood disorders
Weakness
Abdominal pain
Headache


The test may be ordered when an employee is a participant in an occupational lead monitoring program or when someone has a hobby, such as working with stained glass, that brings the person into frequent contact with lead.
The ZPP/heme ratio may be ordered as a screening test for iron deficiency in children and adolescents or when iron deficiency is suspected. Some symptoms of iron deficiency include:

Chronic fatigue, tiredness
Dizziness
Weakness
Headaches


If the iron-deficiency anemia is severe, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, headaches, and leg pains may occur. Children may develop learning (cognitive) disabilities. Besides the general symptoms of anemia, there are certain symptoms that are characteristic of iron deficiency. These include pica (cravings for specific substances, such as licorice, chalk, dirt, or clay), a burning sensation in the tongue or a smooth tongue, sores at the corners of the mouth, and spoon-shaped fingernails and toenails.



","



The ZPP concentration in blood is usually very low. An increase in ZPP indicates a disruption of normal heme production but is not specific as to its cause. The main reasons for increases in ZPP are iron deficiency and lead poisoning.
It is important that ZPP levels be evaluated in the context of a person's history, clinical findings, and the results of other tests such as ferritin, lead, and a complete blood count (CBC). It is possible that the person may have both iron deficiency and lead poisoning.
In cases of chronic lead exposure, ZPP reflects the average lead level over the previous 3-4 months. However, the amount of lead currently present in the blood and the amount in the organs and bones cannot be determined with a ZPP test. Values for ZPP rise more slowly than blood lead concentrations following exposure and take longer to drop after exposure to lead has ceased.
An increase in the ZPP/heme ratio in a child is most often due to iron deficiency. A decreasing ZPP/heme ratio over time following iron supplementation likely indicates successful treatment.



","



ZPP may be elevated in inflammatory conditions, infections, and in people with anemia of chronic disease, but it is not generally used to monitor or diagnose these conditions. A very high ZPP level may be seen in two hereditary diseases: protoporphyria and congenital erythropoietic porphyria (see Porphyria). Both of these disorders are very rare and present with symptoms related to the skin (extreme sensitivity to sunlight). 
Depending on the method used to test ZPP, high levels of other substances in the blood, such as bilirubin and riboflavin, can produce false-positive results. Falsely low values may occur if the sample is not protected from light before testing.



",,"



Zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) is used to monitor chronic exposure to lead in adults. It is also elevated in iron deficiency and maybe ordered to help detect this deficiency in children. A ZPP level can be compared with the hemoglobin level to form a ZPP/heme ratio that is sensitive to diagnosing iron deficiency.
Lead exposure in adults
ZPP testing may be ordered along with a lead level to test for chronic lead exposure. Hobbyists who work with products containing lead and people, especially children who live in older houses built prior to 1960, may have been exposed to lead-based paint products and can be at increased risk for lead poisoning. Inhaling or ingesting lead dust particles from lead batteries, lead pipe-contaminated water, certain leaded fuels, and foods that have been transported in lead-soldered containers, can may also cause elevated lead levels.
In an industrial setting, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) mandates the use of the ZPP test and strongly recommends that a ZPP test is ordered every time a lead level is ordered in order to monitor an employee's exposure. Both are necessary because ZPP will not reflect recent or acute lead exposure because it does not change quickly when a person's source of lead exposure is removed. ZPP is best at detecting a person's average exposure to lead over the last 3-4 months.
ZPP is not sensitive enough for use as a lead screening test in children, as values do not rise until lead concentrations exceed the acceptable range. The maximum lead concentration considered safe in children has been set at a very low level by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In this age group, tests that directly measure the blood lead concentration are done to detect exposure to lead.
Iron deficiency anemia in children
In children, the ZPP/heme ratio is sometimes ordered as an early indicator of iron deficiency. An increase in the ZPP/heme ratio is one of the first signs of insufficient iron stores and will be elevated in most young people before signs or symptoms of anemia are present. More specific tests of iron status are required to confirm iron deficiency.
