Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of medicines in this class. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Brain damage (in children) or
Down's syndrome (Trisomy21) (in children and adults) or
Glaucoma or
Other eye diseases or problems or
Spastic paralysis (in children)—Use of ophthalmic atropine, homatropine, or scopolamine may make the condition worse.

","This section provides information on the proper use of a number of products that contain atropine, homatropine, and scopolamine.  It may not be specific to Atropine. Please read with care.
To use the ophthalmic solution (eye drops) form of this medicine:

First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Drop the medicine into this space. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Do not blink. Keep the eyes closed and apply pressure to the inner corner of the eye with your finger for 2 or 3 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
Immediately after using the eye drops, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them. If you are using the eye drops for an infant or child, be sure to wash his or her hands immediately afterwards also, and do not let any of the medicine get in his or her mouth. In addition, wipe off any medicine that may have accidentally gotten on the infant or child, including his or her face or eyelids.
To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). Also, keep the container tightly closed.

To use the ointment form of this medicine:

First, wash your hands. Tilt the head back and, pressing your finger gently on the skin just beneath the lower eyelid, pull the lower eyelid away from the eye to make a space. Squeeze a thin strip of ointment into this space. A 1/3- to ½;-cm (approximately ⅛-inch in infants and young children and ¼-inch in older children and adults) strip of ointment is usually enough, unless you have been told by your doctor to use a different amount. Let go of the eyelid and gently close the eyes. Keep the eyes closed for 1 or 2 minutes to allow the medicine to be absorbed by the eye.
Immediately after using the eye ointment, wash your hands to remove any medicine that may be on them. If you are using the eye ointment for an infant or child, be sure to wash his or her hands immediately afterwards also, and do not let any of the medicine get in his or her mouth. In addition, wipe off any medicine that may have accidentally gotten on the infant or child, including his or her face or eyelids.
To keep the medicine as germ-free as possible, do not touch the applicator tip to any surface (including the eye). After using the eye ointment, wipe the tip of the ointment tube with a clean tissue and keep the tube tightly closed.

Use this medicine only as directed. Do not use more of it and do not use it more often than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance of too much medicine being absorbed into the body and the chance of side effects. This is especially important when this medicine is used in infants and children, since overdose is very dangerous in infants and children.

bactrim-ds,"Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination is used to treat infections such as urinary tract infections, middle ear infections (otitis media), bronchitis, traveler's diarrhea, and shigellosis (bacillary dysentery). This medicine is also used to prevent or treat Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a very serious kind of pneumonia. This type of pneumonia occurs more commonly in patients whose immune systems are not working normally, such as cancer patients, transplant patients, and patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination is an antibiotic. It works by eliminating the bacteria that cause many kinds of infections. This medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination in children 2 months of age and older. Because of the toxicity of the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, use in infants younger than 2 months of age is not recommended.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have a folate deficiency, age-related kidney or liver problems, and may be more likely to experience unwanted side effects (eg, severe skin rash, increased potassium in the body, or problems with blood clotting or the immune system). There may be an adjustment in the dose for elderly patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim combination.
Breastfeeding
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.

biaxin,"Clarithromycin is used to treat bacterial infections in many different parts of the body. It is also used in combination with other medicines to treat duodenal ulcers caused by H. pylori. This medicine is also used to prevent and treat Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection.
Clarithromycin belongs to the class of medicines, known as macrolide antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, this medicine will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of clarithromycin to treat bacterial infections in children younger than 6 months of age, and to prevent and treat Mycobacterium avium complex in children younger than 20 months of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of clarithromycin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have severe kidney problems and heart rhythm problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving clarithromycin.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below.

budesonide-and-formoterol,"Asthma (controller/maintenance): Treatment of asthma in patients ≥6 years of age.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema; to reduce COPD exacerbations.
",,"Note: If chronic obstructive pulmonary disease symptoms occur in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) should be taken for immediate relief. For acute asthma exacerbations, budesonide/formoterol is preferred as a reliever; however, SABAs may be used. In patients presenting to primary care or acute care facility, SABAs are recommended for the acute management of exacerbations. For both Step 1 and Step 2 mild asthma, budesonide/formoterol may be used on an as-needed basis for control of asthma symptoms. Alternatively, a SABA as needed and daily use of low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid for Step 2 mild asthma may be used. Both options appear equally effective in reducing the frequency and severity of exacerbations in Step 2 mild asthma, but symptom control is somewhat better with daily inhaled glucocorticoids (Busse 2008; GINA 2020). The maximum dose is based on the formoterol component; to increase the dose of the inhaled glucocorticoid component, a separate inhaler with a higher budesonide dose per inhalation must be prescribed.
Asthma (controller/maintenance): Oral inhalation:
Starting dose is based on asthma severity.
Metered-dose inhaler:
Budesonide 80 mcg/formoterol 4.5 mcg: 2 inhalations once or twice daily (GINA 2020; Rabe 2006); if response is inadequate, may increase to higher dose combination after 1 to 2 weeks; maximum dose: Budesonide 160 mcg/formoterol 4.5 mcg: 2 inhalations twice daily.
Budesonide 160 mcg/formoterol 4.5 mcg: 2 inhalations twice daily (Patel 2013)
Dry powder inhaler [Canadian product]:
Moderate to severe asthma, inhaler used as maintenance therapy only: 
Symbicort 100 Turbuhaler, Symbicort 200 Turbuhaler: 1 to 2 inhalations once or twice daily until symptom control, then titrate to lowest effective dosage to maintain control.

","Concerns related to adverse effects:
• Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving >20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do not provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections. Do not use this product to transfer patients from oral corticosteroid therapy.
• Asthma-related deaths: The use of long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABAs) as monotherapy has been associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related deaths (SMART 2006; Walters 2007); additional data from other clinical trials suggests risk of asthma-related hospitalization may also be increased with LABA monotherapy in pediatric and adolescent patients. However, data from large randomized, double-blind controlled trials do not show a significant increase in risk of serious asthma-related events (including hospitalizations, intubations, and death) in adults, adolescents, and pediatric patients (aged 4 to 11 years) when fixed-dose LABAs are used with inhaled corticosteroids combined in a single inhaler compared with inhaled corticosteroid monotherapy (FDA 2017). Current guidelines recommend the use of an as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid with formoterol for patients with infrequent symptoms (GINA 2020). No data exist associating LABA use with an increased risk of death in patients with COPD.
• Bone density: Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density. Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, anticonvulsants or oral corticosteroids); high doses and/or long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.
• Bronchospasm: Rarely, paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; this should be distinguished from inadequate response.
• Hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm) have been reported.
• Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use if possible in patients with ocular herpes; active or quiescent tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; or untreated viral, fungal, or bacterial or parasitic systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If exposure to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin may be indicated.
• Lower respiratory infections: Pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections have been reported in patients with COPD following the use of inhaled corticosteroids; monitor COPD patients closely since pneumonia symptoms may overlap symptoms of exacerbations.
• Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal Candida infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while either continuing or interrupting (if necessary) budesonide/formoterol therapy.
• Serious effects/fatalities: Do not exceed recommended dose; serious adverse events, including fatalities, have been associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetics.
• Vasculitis: Rare cases of vasculitis (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]) or other systemic eosinophilic conditions can occur; often associated with decrease and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following initiation of inhaled corticosteroid.
Disease-related concerns:
• Asthma: Appropriate use: For acute asthma exacerbations, budesonide/formoterol is preferred as a reliever; however, short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABAs) may be used. In patients presenting to primary care or acute care facility, SABAs are recommended for the acute management of exacerbations (GINA 2020).
• Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disease (arrhythmia, coronary insufficiency, or hypertension); beta agonists may cause elevation in blood pressure, heart rate and result in CNS stimulation/excitation. Beta-2 agonists may also increase risk of arrhythmias and ECG changes, such as flattening of the T-wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Use with caution following acute MI; corticosteroids have been associated with myocardial rupture.
• COPD: Appropriate use: Do not use for acute episodes of COPD. Do not initiate in patients with significantly worsening or acutely deteriorating COPD. Data are not available to determine if LABA use increases the risk of death in patients with COPD.
• Diabetes: Use with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; beta-2 agonists may increase serum glucose and aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.
• Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; may lead to accumulation of budesonide and formoterol; monitor closely.
• Hypokalemia: Use with caution in patients with hypokalemia; beta-2 agonists may decrease serum potassium (transient).
• Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use of inhaled corticosteroids. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.
• Seizure disorders: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders; beta agonists may result in CNS stimulation/excitation.
• Thyroid disease: Changes in thyroid status may necessitate dosage adjustments; metabolic clearance of corticosteroids increases in hyperthyroid patients and decreases in hypothyroidism.
Special populations:
• Pediatric: LABAs when used as monotherapy, may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in pediatric and adolescent patients. When LABAs are used in a fixed-dose combination with inhaled corticosteroids, data from large clinical trials in adolescents do not show a significant increase in the risk of serious asthma-related events (hospitalizations, intubations, death) compared to inhaled corticosteroids alone. Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 centimeter per year [range 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.
Other warnings/precautions:
• Discontinuation of systemic corticosteroids: Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy with gradual tapering of dose; consider reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis beginning after at least 1 week of inhalation therapy. Monitor lung function, beta agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.

Hypokalemia (low potassium in the blood) or
Hypomagnesemia (low magnesium in the blood) or
Hypovolemia (low blood volume) or
Thrombocytopenia (low platelets in the blood)—Use with caution. Bumetanide may make these conditions worse .


Diabetes—Bumetanide may increase the amount of sugar in the blood .


Kidney disease, severe—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body .

","Dosing
The dose of bumetanide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of bumetanide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage form (tablets):

For edema:

Adults—0.5 to 2 milligrams (mg) once a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor .





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of bumetanide, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.

buprenorphine-and-naloxone,"Opioid use disorder: Treatment of opioid use disorder.
General information: Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used as part of a complete treatment plan to include counseling and psychosocial support.
",,"Opioid use disorder: Note:  Prior to induction, consider type of opioid use (ie, long- or short-acting opioid) and time since last use of opioid. 
Patients on heroin or short-acting prescription opioids should initiate buprenorphine/naloxone when signs of opioid withdrawal occur, but no sooner than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid (SAMHSA 2018; manufacturer’s labeling).
Patients on methadone should have their methadone maintenance dose reduced to the minimum tolerable dose and remain on that dose for ≥7 days; initiate buprenorphine/naloxone only when early signs of withdrawal appear but no sooner than 24 hours after the last methadone dose. Waiting ≥36 hours after last use of methadone and initiating at lower doses (eg, buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg) decreases risk of precipitated methadone withdrawal (SAMHSA 2018). Despite the manufacturer’s recommendation to use buprenorphine instead of buprenorphine/naloxone during the induction period for long-acting opioid dependence due to the risk of withdrawal caused by naloxone, some experts recommend the combination product or buprenorphine for induction for long- and short-acting opioids (SAMHSA 2018).
US labeling:
 Induction:
Note:
Titrate induction dose carefully to control acute withdrawal symptoms while avoiding sedation and monitoring for onset of precipitated withdrawal symptoms (SAMHSA 2018).
Buccal film (Bunavail: Buprenorphine 2.1 mg/naloxone 0.3 mg; buprenorphine 4.2 mg/naloxone 0.7 mg; buprenorphine 6.3 mg/naloxone 1 mg):
Day 1 induction dose: Initial: Buccal: Buprenorphine 2.1 mg/naloxone 0.3 mg; may repeat dose after ~2 hours, based on control of acute withdrawal symptoms; maximum total dose: buprenorphine 4.2 mg/naloxone 0.7 mg.
Day 2 induction dose: Up to buprenorphine 8.4 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg as a single dose.
Sublingual film (Suboxone: Buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg; buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg; buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg; buprenorphine 12 mg/naloxone 3 mg):
Day 1 induction dose: Initial: Sublingual: Buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg or buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg; may titrate dose, based on control of acute withdrawal symptoms, in buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg or buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg increments approximately every 2 hours up to a total dose of buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg.
Day 2 induction dose: Sublingual: Up to buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg as a single dose
Sublingual tablet (Zubsolv: Buprenorphine 0.7 mg/naloxone 0.18 mg, buprenorphine 1.4 mg/naloxone 0.36 mg, buprenorphine 2.9 mg/naloxone 0.71 mg, buprenorphine 5.7 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg, buprenorphine 8.6 mg/naloxone 2.1 mg, or buprenorphine 11.4 mg/naloxone 2.9 mg):
Day 1 induction dose: Sublingual: Start with an initial dose of buprenorphine 1.4 mg/naloxone 0.36 mg; based on control of acute withdrawal symptoms, may administer additional doses in increments of 1 to 2 buprenorphine 1.4 mg/naloxone 0.36 mg tablets every 1.5 to 2 hours to a total day 1 dose up to buprenorphine 5.7 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg. Some patients (eg, those with recent exposure to buprenorphine) may tolerate up to buprenorphine 4.2 mg/naloxone 1.08 mg as a single, second dose.
Day 2 induction dose: Sublingual: Up to buprenorphine 11.4 mg/naloxone 2.9 mg as a single dose
Maintenance: 
Buccal film (Bunavail: Buprenorphine 2.1 mg/naloxone 0.3 mg, buprenorphine 4.2 mg/naloxone 0.7 mg, buprenorphine 6.3 mg/naloxone 1 mg): Buccal: Target dose: Buprenorphine 8.4 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg once daily; dosage should be adjusted in increments/decrements of buprenorphine 2.1 mg/naloxone 0.3 mg to a level that maintains treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms; usual range: Buprenorphine 2.1 to 12.6 mg/naloxone 0.3 to 2.1 mg once daily.
Sublingual film (Suboxone: Buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg; buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg; buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg; buprenorphine 12 mg/naloxone 3 mg): Sublingual or buccal: Target dose: Buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg once daily; dosage should be adjusted in increments/decrements of buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg or buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg to a level that maintains treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms; usual range: Buprenorphine 4 to 24 mg/naloxone 1 to 6 mg once daily.
Sublingual film (Cassipa: Buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg): Sublingual: Buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg once daily; dosage should be adjusted to a level that maintains treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms. Note: Buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg sublingual film is only for use following titration from lower doses.
Sublingual tablet (buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg or buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg): Sublingual: Target dose: Buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg once daily; dosage should be adjusted in increments/decrements of buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg or buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg to a level that maintains treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms; usual range: Buprenorphine 4 to 24 mg/naloxone 1 to 6 mg once daily. Doses higher than buprenorphine 24 mg/naloxone 6 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage.
Sublingual tablet (Zubsolv: Buprenorphine 0.7 mg/naloxone 0.18 mg, buprenorphine 1.4 mg/naloxone 0.36 mg, buprenorphine 2.9 mg/naloxone 0.71 mg, buprenorphine 5.7 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg, buprenorphine 8.6 mg/naloxone 2.1 mg, or buprenorphine 11.4 mg/naloxone 2.9 mg): Sublingual: Target dose: Buprenorphine 11.4 mg/naloxone 2.9 mg once daily; dosage should be adjusted in increments/decrements of buprenorphine 2.9 mg/naloxone 0.71 mg or lower to a level that maintains treatment and suppresses opioid withdrawal symptoms; usual range: Buprenorphine 2.9 to 17.2 mg/naloxone 0.71 to 4.2 mg once daily. Doses higher than buprenorphine 17.2 mg/naloxone 4.2 mg have not been demonstrated to provide any clinical advantage.
Switching between sublingual tablets and sublingual film: Same dosage should be used as the previous administered product. Note: Potential for greater bioavailability with certain sublingual film strengths compared to the same strength of the sublingual tablet; monitor closely for either over- or underdosing when switching patients from one formulation to another.
Switching between buccal film and sublingual tablets or films: Due to differences in the bioavailability of Bunavail buccal films compared to other buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, different strengths must be given to achieve equivalent doses. When switching between Bunavail and other sublingual tablets, corresponding dosage strengths are as follows:
Bunavail buprenorphine 2.1 mg/naloxone 0.3 mg = buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg sublingual tablets or films
Bunavail buprenorphine 4.2 mg/naloxone 0.7 mg = buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg sublingual tablets or films
Bunavail buprenorphine 6.3 mg/naloxone 1 mg = buprenorphine 12 mg/naloxone 3 mg sublingual tablets or films
Switching between sublingual film strengths:
Systemic exposure may be different with various combinations of sublingual film strengths; pharmacists should not substitute one or more film strengths for another (eg, switching from three buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg films to a single buprenorphine 12 mg/naloxone 3 mg film, or vice-versa) without health care provider approval, and patients should be monitored closely for either over- or underdosing when switching between film strengths.
Cassipa: Patients may switch from two buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg sublingual films to a single buprenorphine 16 mg/ naloxone 4 mg sublingual film.
Switching between sublingual and buccal sites of administration (Suboxone): Systemic exposure between buccal and sublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film is similar. Once induction is complete, patients can switch between buccal and sublingual administration without significant risk of under or overdosing.
Switching between sublingual tablet products: Due to differences in the bioavailability of Zubsolv sublingual tablets compared to other buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual tablets, different strengths must be given to achieve equivalent doses. When switching between Zubsolv and other sublingual tablets, corresponding dosage strengths are as follows:
Zubsolv buprenorphine 1.4 mg/naloxone 0.36 mg sublingual tablets = buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg sublingual tablets
Zubsolv buprenorphine 2.9 mg/naloxone 0.71 mg sublingual tablets = buprenorphine 4 mg/naloxone 1 mg (as two buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg sublingual tablets)
Zubsolv buprenorphine 5.7 mg/naloxone 1.4 mg sublingual tablets = buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg sublingual tablets
Zubsolv buprenorphine 8.6 mg/naloxone 2.1 mg sublingual tablet = buprenorphine 12 mg/naloxone 3 mg sublingual tablets (as one buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg sublingual tablets and two buprenorphine 2 mg/naloxone 0.5 mg sublingual tablets)
Zubsolv buprenorphine 11.4 mg/naloxone 2.9 mg sublingual tablet = buprenorphine 16 mg/naloxone 4 mg sublingual tablets (as two buprenorphine 8 mg/naloxone 2 mg sublingual tablets)
Canadian labeling: Sublingual tablet: Note: Dose based on buprenorphine content.
Induction: Day 1: Initial: 4 mg as single dose; may repeat dose if necessary depending on patient's requirement; target dose: 8 to 12 mg.
Maintenance: Day 2 and beyond: Titrate per response in increments or decrements of 2 to 8 mg; usual maintenance dose: 12 to 16 mg once daily (maximum: 24 mg/day). Upon stabilization, may consider less frequent administration of corresponding equivalent dose (eg, 16 mg every other day instead of 8 mg/day or 3 times/week dosing [eg, Monday-Wednesday-Friday] with twice the maintenance dose on Monday and Wednesday and three times the maintenance dose on Friday); continue to limit maximum dose to 24 mg/day on any single day. Note: When switching dosing to less than once daily, monitor all patients for at least 90 minutes following the initial dose of the new regimen. The less frequent dosing regimen is not recommended in patients dependent on concurrent CNS-active drugs, including ethanol.
Missed doses: Reassess patients who have missed multiple doses; initial induction doses may be required when resuming therapy.
Discontinuation of therapy: When discontinuing buprenorphine/naloxone for long-term treatment of opioid use disorder, gradually decrease the dose over several months (SAMHSA 2018).
Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.
","Concerns related to adverse effects:
• CNS depression: May cause CNS depression, which may impair physical or mental abilities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery, driving).
• Hepatic events: Hepatitis has been reported; hepatic events ranged from transient, asymptomatic transaminase elevations to hepatic failure; in many cases, patients had preexisting hepatic impairment. Monitor liver function tests in patients at increased risk for hepatotoxicity (eg, history of alcohol or IV drug abuse, preexisting hepatic dysfunction) prior to and during therapy.
• Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity, including bronchospasm, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylactic shock, have been reported.
• Hypotension: May cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope; use with caution in patients with hypovolemia, cardiovascular disease (including acute MI), or drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects (including phenothiazines or general anesthetics). Monitor for symptoms of hypotension following initiation or dose titration. Use with caution in patients with circulatory shock.
• Respiratory depression: Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur. Monitor closely for respiratory depression, especially during initiation or dose escalation. Misuse by self-injection of buprenorphine or the concomitant use of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines (or other CNS depressants, including alcohol) may result in coma or death. Use with caution in patients with compromised respiratory function (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression). Patients and caregivers should be educated on how to recognize respiratory depression and the importance of getting emergency assistance immediately (eg, calling 911) in the event of known or suspected overdose.
Disease-related concerns:
• Abdominal conditions: May obscure diagnosis or clinical course of patients with acute abdominal conditions.
• Adrenocortical insufficiency: Use with caution in patients with adrenal insufficiency, including Addison disease. Long-term opioid use may cause secondary hypogonadism, which may lead to mood disorders and osteoporosis (Brennan 2013).
• Biliary tract impairment: Use with caution in patients with biliary tract dysfunction, including acute pancreatitis; opioids may cause constriction of sphincter of Oddi.
• Bowel obstruction: Use with caution in patients with a history of ileus or bowel obstruction.
• CNS depression/coma: Use with caution in patients with impaired consciousness or coma because these patients are susceptible to intracranial effects of CO2 retention.
• Delirium tremens: Use with caution in patients with delirium tremens.
• Head trauma: Use with extreme caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, or elevated intracranial pressure; exaggerated elevation of ICP may occur. Buprenorphine can produce miosis and changes in the level of consciousness that may interfere with patient evaluation.
• Hepatic impairment: Use is not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment for induction therapy (Suboxone) or in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Use with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment for maintenance treatment; due to reduced clearance of naloxone and potential for reduced buprenorphine efficacy, use may not be appropriate.
• Obesity: Use with caution in patients who are morbidly obese (DeVido 2015).
• Prostatic hyperplasia/urinary stricture: Use with caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia and/or urinary stricture.
• Psychosis: Use with caution in patients with toxic psychosis.
• Respiratory disease: Use with caution and monitor for respiratory depression in patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, or kyphoscoliosis, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or preexisting respiratory depression, particularly when initiating and titrating therapy; critical respiratory depression may occur, even at therapeutic dosages.
• Seizure: Use with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorders; may cause or exacerbate preexisting seizures.
• Sleep-related disorders: Opioid use increases the risk for sleep-related disorders (eg, central sleep apnea [CSA], hypoxemia) in a dose-dependent fashion. Use with caution and titrate dosage cautiously in patients with risk factors for sleep-disordered breathing (eg, heart failure, obesity). Consider dose reduction in patients presenting with CSA. Avoid opioids in patients with moderate to severe sleep-disordered breathing (CDC [Dowell 2016]).
• Thyroid dysfunction: Use with caution in patients with thyroid dysfunction.
Concurrent drug therapy issues:
• Benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants: Concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol and opioids, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Prohibiting medication-assisted treatment of opioid use disorder may increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, therefore patients should be educated on the risks of concomitant use with benzodiazepines, sedatives, opioid analgesics, and alcohol. Strategies should be developed to manage use of prescribed or illicit benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants at initiation of or during treatment with buprenorphine; adjustments to induction procedures and additional monitoring may be required. If appropriate, delay or omit buprenorphine dose if a patient is sedated at time of buprenorphine dosing. Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred; gradual tapering of benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant, decreasing to lowest effective dose, or monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. Consider prescribing naloxone for emergency treatment of opioid overdose in patients taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants concomitantly with opioids. Benzodiazepines are not the treatment of choice for anxiety or insomnia for patients in buprenorphine treatment; make sure patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications for anxiety and insomnia prior to coadministration of benzodiazepines and buprenorphine.
Special populations:
• Cachectic or debilitated patients: Use with caution in cachectic or debilitated patients; there is a greater potential for life-threatening respiratory depression, even at therapeutic dosages.
• Elderly: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more sensitive to adverse effects (eg, life-threatening respiratory depression).
• Neonates: Neonatal withdrawal syndrome: Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can cause neonatal withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available. Signs and symptoms include irritability, hyperactivity and abnormal sleep pattern, high-pitched cry, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. Onset, duration, and severity depend on the drug used, duration of use, maternal dose, and rate of drug elimination by the newborn.
Special handling:
• Disposal: Dispose of unused buccal and sublingual films (if they are no longer needed) by removing from foil patch and flushing down the toilet. If multiple films are no longer needed, flush each film individually.
Other warnings/precautions:
• Accidental ingestion: Accidental ingestion in children can result in severe respiratory depression (may be fatal); store buprenorphine-containing medications out of reach of children and dispose of unused medication appropriately.
• Acute pain: When using buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder, treat acute pain with nonopioid analgesics whenever possible. If treatment with a high-affinity full opioid analgesic is required, monitor closely for respiratory depression because high doses may be necessary to achieve pain relief.
• Addiction/abuse/misuse: Use exposes patients and other users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, potentially leading to overdose and death. Assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing; monitor all patients regularly for development of these behaviors or conditions. Use with caution in patients with a history of substance use disorder; potential for opioid use disorder exists. Other factors associated with an increased risk for misuse include younger age and psychotropic medication use. Consider offering naloxone prescriptions in patients with factors associated with an increased risk for overdose, such as history of overdose or substance use disorder, higher opioid dosages (≥50 morphine milligram equivalents/day orally), and concomitant benzodiazepine use (Dowell [CDC 2016]).
• Appropriate use: Buprenorphine/naloxone is not appropriate for pain management; deaths have been reported in opioid-naive patients receiving oral buprenorphine for analgesia.
• Discontinuation of therapy: There is no maximum recommended duration for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder; patients may require treatment indefinitely. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid agonist/partial agonist medication-assisted treatment.
• Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients who are prescribed opioid analgesics, as well as their caregivers, and consider prescribing it to patients who are at increased risk of opioid overdose. These include patients who are also taking benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, have an opioid use disorder (OUD) (current or history of), or have experienced a previous opioid overdose. Additionally, health care providers should consider prescribing naloxone to patients prescribed medications to treat OUD; patients at risk of opioid overdose even if they are not taking an opioid analgesic or medication to treat OUD; and patients taking opioids, including methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, if they have household members, including children, or other close contacts at risk for accidental ingestion or opioid overdose. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help.
• Partial opioid agonist and mixed opioid agonist/antagonist overdose: Reversal of partial opioid agonists or mixed opioid agonist/antagonists (eg, buprenorphine, pentazocine) may be incomplete and higher than normal doses and repeated administration of naloxone may be required.
• Withdrawal: Concurrent use of opioid agonist/antagonist analgesics may precipitate withdrawal symptoms and/or reduced analgesic efficacy in patients following prolonged therapy with mu opioid agonists. Abrupt discontinuation following prolonged use may also lead to withdrawal symptoms and is not recommended; taper dose gradually when discontinuing. Treatment of opioid use disorder with buprenorphine/naloxone should not be started until effects of withdrawal are evident.

Canadian labeling (sublingual tablets): Additional contraindications (not in US labeling): Opioid-naive patients; severe respiratory insufficiency (eg, acute or severe bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive airway, status asthmaticus, acute respiratory depression, cor pulmonale); severe hepatic impairment; acute alcohol intoxication or delirium tremens; convulsive or seizure disorders; known or suspected mechanical GI obstruction or diseases/conditions that affect bowel transit (eg, ileus of any type); suspected surgical abdomen (eg, acute appendicitis or pancreatitis); severe CNS depression, increased cerebrospinal or intracranial pressure, or head injury; concurrent use or within 2 weeks of MAO inhibitors.
","Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Protect from freezing and moisture.
","Buprenorphine and naloxone can be detected in cord blood following maternal use of sublingual tablets; cord blood concentrations of buprenorphine and naloxone correlate with maternal serum levels (Weigand 2016).
Prolonged use of opioids during pregnancy can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated and requires management according to protocols developed by neonatology experts. If opioid use is required for a prolonged period in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure appropriate treatment will be available.
Opioid agonist pharmacotherapy is recommended when treating opioid use disorder in pregnancy; however, use of buprenorphine monotherapy is currently preferred due to limited safety data with the buprenorphine/naloxone combination product (ACOG 711 2017; SAMHSA 2018). Treatment with the combination product should not be initiated during pregnancy (SAMHSA 2018).

cefepime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ceftriaxone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cefuroxime,"Cefuroxime is used to treat bacterial infections in many different parts of the body. It belongs to the class of medicines known as cephalosporin antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria or preventing their growth. However, cefuroxime will not work for colds, flu, or other virus infections.
Cefuroxime is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For cefuroxime, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to cefuroxime or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cefuroxime in children. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in infants younger than 3 months of age.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of cefuroxime in the elderly.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.
Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of cefuroxime. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Colitis (inflammation in gut), history of or
Diarrhea, severe, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.


Kidney disease—Use with caution. Effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.


Phenylketonuria (PKU)—The oral liquid form of cefuroxime contains phenylalanine, which can make this condition worse.

","Take cefuroxime only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
Ceftin® oral liquid works differently than Ceftin® tablets, even at the same dose (number of milligrams). Do not switch from the tablets to the oral liquid unless your doctor tells you to.
The oral liquid form must be taken with meals, while the tablet form may be given with or without food.
Swallow the tablets whole. Do not break, crush, or chew it.
Shake the oral liquid well before each use. Measure the medicine with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.
Keep using cefuroxime for the full treatment time, even if you feel better after the first few doses. Your infection may not clear up if you stop using the medicine too soon.
Dosing
The dose of cefuroxime will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of cefuroxime. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For infections:

For oral dosage form (film-coated tablets):

Adults and teenagers—250 to 500 milligrams (mg) two times a day for 10 days. Gonorrhea is treated with a single 1-gram (g) dose.
Children (who can swallow the tablets)—250 mg two times a day for 10 days.
Children (who cannot swallow the tablets)—Use is not recommended.


For oral dosage form (suspension):

Children 3 months to 12 years of age—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The dose is usually 20 to 30 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day divided into two doses, taken for 10 days. However, the dose is usually not more than 1000 mg.
Infants up to 3 months—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of cefuroxime, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
Store the oral liquid in the refrigerator. Throw away any unused medicine after 10 days.
Store the tablets in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
","If your symptoms do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse, check with your doctor.
Cefuroxime may cause diarrhea, and in some cases it can be severe. Do not take any medicine or give medicine to your child to treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor. Diarrhea medicines may make the diarrhea worse or make it last longer. If you have any questions about this or if mild diarrhea continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.
Before you or your child have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are using cefuroxime. The results of some tests may be affected by cefuroxime.

dexamethasone-intensol,"Dexamethasone provides relief for inflamed areas of the body. It is used to treat a number of different conditions, such as inflammation (swelling), severe allergies, adrenal problems, arthritis, asthma, blood or bone marrow problems, kidney problems, skin conditions, and flare-ups of multiple sclerosis. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid (cortisone-like medicine or steroid). It works on the immune system to help relieve swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions.
Dexamethasone tablets are also used in combination with other anti-myeloma products for the treatment of adults with multiple myeloma.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Take this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. To do so may increase the chance for unwanted effects.
Measure the oral liquid with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.
The Dexamethasone Intensol™ solution is a concentrated liquid. Measure the concentrated liquid with the special oral dropper that comes with the package. The liquid should be added to water, juice, soda or a soda-like beverage, applesauce, or pudding. Stir the mixture well and drink or eat it right away. Do not store the mixture for future use.
You may take Hemady™ with or without food.
If you use this medicine for a long time, do not suddenly stop using it without checking first with your doctor. You may need to slowly decrease your dose before stopping it completely.
Dosing
The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage forms (solution, tablets):

Dose depends on medical condition:

Adults—At first, 0.75 to 9 milligrams (mg) per day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.
Children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 0.02 to 0.3 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight per day, divided and taken 3 or 4 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed.

In addition, you should not be around other persons living in your household who receive live virus vaccines because there is a chance they could pass the virus on to you. Some examples of live vaccines include measles, mumps, influenza (nasal flu vaccine), poliovirus (oral form), rotavirus, and rubella. Do not get close to them and do not stay in the same room with them for very long. If you have questions about this, talk to your doctor.

docusate,"Stool softener: Prevention of  straining during defecation and constipation associated with hard, dry stools; relief of occasional constipation
",,"Note: The following are general dosing guidelines; refer to specific product labeling for dosing instructions.
Stool softener: 
Oral:
Docusate calcium: 240 mg once daily
Docusate sodium: 50 to 360 mg once daily or in divided doses
Rectal: 283 mg per 5 mL: 283 mg (1 enema) 1 to 3 times daily
Ceruminolytic (off-label use): Intra-aural: Administer 1 mL of docusate sodium in 2 mL syringes; if no clearance in 15 minutes, irrigate with 50 or 100 mL lukewarm normal saline (Singer 2000) 
","Dosage forms specific issues:
• Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP 1997; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin.
• Enema: For rectal use only; lubricate tip prior to insertion. Discontinue use and notify health care provider if rash around the anus/rectal irritation occurs or if resistance is encountered with insertion; forcing the tube may result in injury or damage to the rectum.
Other warnings/precautions:
• Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication (OTC), patients should be instructed to contact healthcare provider prior to use if nausea, stomach  pain, or vomiting are present, or if a sudden change in bowel habits occurs and persists over 14 days. Patients should discontinue use and notify healthcare provider if rectal bleeding occurs, if a bowel movement fails to occur after use, or if use is needed >7 days.
",,,"There are no known significant interactions.
",,,,"Reduces surface tension of the oil-water interface of the stool resulting in enhanced incorporation of water and fat allowing for stool softening (Roering, 2010)
Excretion
Feces (Gattuso 1994)
","OTC labeling: When used for self-medication, do not use for longer than 7 days; when abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting is present; or concomitantly with mineral oil (oral products only)
","Store at room temperature. Protect from freezing, heat humidity, and light.
","Hypomagnesemia was reported in a newborn following chronic maternal overuse of docusate sodium throughout pregnancy (Schindler 1984).
Treatment of constipation in pregnant women is similar to that of nonpregnant patients and medications may be used when diet and lifestyle modifications are not effective. Agents other than docusate are recommended in pregnancy (Body 2016). Stool softeners may be used for the treatment of hemorrhoids (Shin 2015).
","What is this drug used for?
• It is used to treat constipation.
All drugs may cause side effects. However, many people have no side effects or only have minor side effects. Call your doctor or get medical help if any of these side effects or any other side effects bother you or do not go away:
• Abdominal cramps
WARNING/CAUTION: Even though it may be rare, some people may have very bad and sometimes deadly side effects when taking a drug. Tell your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms that may be related to a very bad side effect:
• Rectal irritation
• Signs of an allergic reaction, like rash; hives; itching; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin with or without fever; wheezing; tightness in the chest or throat; trouble breathing, swallowing, or talking; unusual hoarseness; or swelling of the mouth, face, lips, tongue, or throat.

doxepin,"Doxepin is used to treat anxiety or depression. It is also used to treat insomnia (trouble with sleeping).
Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It works on the central nervous system (CNS) to increase levels of certain chemicals in the brain.
Doxepin is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For doxepin, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to doxepin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of doxepin capsules and solution for the treatment of depression and anxiety in children younger than 12 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of doxepin tablets for the treatment of insomnia in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of doxepin in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have unwanted effects (eg, confusion or unusual drowsiness) or age-related heart, liver, or kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving doxepin.
Breastfeeding
Studies in women breastfeeding have demonstrated harmful infant effects. An alternative to this medication should be prescribed or you should stop breastfeeding while using doxepin.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking doxepin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.
Using doxepin with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.

If you do, you may have confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high body temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions.
If you or your child are using doxepin for depression or anxiety, do not stop taking it without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent a possible worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as headache, nausea, or a general feeling of discomfort or illness.
Silenor® tablets may cause sleep-related behaviors such as driving a car (sleep-driving), walking (sleep-walking), having sex, making phone calls, or preparing and eating food while asleep or not fully awake. If any of these reactions occur, tell your doctor right away.
If you think you need to take Silenor® tablets for more than 10 days, talk to your doctor.
Doxepin may cause some people to become drowsy. Make sure you know how you react to doxepin before you drive, use medicines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are drowsy or not alert.
Doxepin will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that slow down the nervous system, possibly causing drowsiness). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics. This effect may last for a few days after you stop taking doxepin. Check with your doctor before taking any of the above while you or your child are using doxepin.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines) and herbal or vitamin supplements.

formoterol,"Bronchospasm in Asthma
Formoterol: Used concomitantly with long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) for prevention of bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease (e.g., asthma).    
Monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., formoterol) increases the risk of asthma-related death and may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents. Use of formoterol alone for treatment of asthma without concomitant use of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) is contraindicated.  (See Asthma-related Death and Serious Asthma-related Events under Cautions.)
Formoterol in fixed combination with budesonide or mometasone (formoterol/budesonide, formoterol/mometasone): Treatment of asthma only in patients not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist. 
Once asthma control achieved and maintained, assess patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue formoterol or formoterol/budesonide) if possible without loss of asthma control, and maintain patient on long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids). 
Do not use formoterol/budesonide in patients with asthma adequately controlled on low or medium dosage of inhaled corticosteroids.
Formoterol alone or in fixed combination with budesonide or mometasone not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm; do not initiate in patients with rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma.  (See Acute Exacerbations of Asthma or COPD under Cautions.)
Bronchospasm in COPD
Formoterol, formoterol/budesonide, or formoterol in fixed combination with glycopyrrolate (formoterol/glycopyrrolate): Long-term maintenance treatment of bronchospasm or airflow obstruction associated with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.     
Do not initiate formoterol alone or in fixed combination with budesonide or glycopyrrolate in patients with substantially worsening or acutely deteriorating COPD; do not use to treat acute symptoms.   (See Acute Exacerbations of Asthma or COPD under Cautions.)
Use of long-acting β2 agonists (e.g., formoterol) with or without inhaled corticosteroids for acute exacerbations of COPD not evaluated. Use a short-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist intermittently (as needed) for acute symptoms of COPD.   
",,"General


When initiating formoterol alone or in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone, discontinue regular use of short-acting, oral or inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists; use such agents only for relief of acute symptoms of asthma or COPD not controlled by formoterol.   


If a formoterol dose alone or in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone is missed, skip that dose and take the next dose at the usual time.    Do not double the dose to replace the missed dose.   


Failure to respond to a previously effective dosage may indicate seriously worsening asthma or destabilization of COPD that requires reevaluation.     Extra or increased doses of formoterol are not recommended.      (See Acute Exacerbations of Asthma or COPD under Cautions.)


Administer a short-acting, inhaled β2-agonist to relieve acute asthmatic or COPD symptoms.   


Administration
Oral Inhalation
Formoterol: Administer by oral inhalation as an oral inhalation solution (Perforomist) via nebulization.
Fixed combinations of formoterol/budesonide (Symbicort), formoterol/glycopyrrolate (Bevespi Aerosphere), and formoterol/mometasone (Dulera): Administer by oral inhalation using a metered-dose aerosol inhaler with hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant.  
Inhalation Solution
Administer twice daily, approximately every 12 hours (morning and evening).
Store single-dose vials of oral inhalation solution in the foil pouch provided; remove immediately before use.
For administration of inhalation solution via nebulization, open a 20-mcg vial and squeeze entire contents into nebulizer reservoir. Connect reservoir to mouthpiece or face mask and then to compressor according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Instruct patient to sit in an upright, comfortable position and then to breathe as calmly, deeply, and evenly as possible through the mouth using the mouthpiece or face mask of the nebulizer until device stops producing mist, about 9 minutes.
Clean nebulizer after use according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Safety and efficacy of formoterol inhalation solution delivered from a nebulizer other than the Pari-LC Plus nebulizer or a compressor other than the PRONEB Ultra compressor not established.
Do not mix with other inhalation solutions. Do not ingest the oral inhalation solution.
Inhalation Aerosol
Administer aerosol containing formoterol/budesonide, formoterol/glycopyrrolate, or formoterol/mometasone as 2 inhalations twice daily (morning and evening).   After inhalation of formoterol/budesonide or formoterol/mometasone, rinse mouth and spit out water. 
Use actuator supplied with the product to administer formoterol in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone.  
Formoterol/budesonide: Test spray 2 times into the air (away from face) before first use, if not used for >7 days, or if dropped; shake well for 5 seconds before each spray. Shake well for 5 seconds immediately prior to use. Clean inhaler every 7 days by wiping mouthpiece with a dry cloth.
Formoterol/glycopyrrolate: Shake well before each inhalation. Prime the inhaler before first use. Test spray 4 times into the air (away from face) before initial use; if not used for >7 days, repeat priming process (using only 2 sprays instead of 4). Clean inhaler once weekly by removing the canister from the actuator; do not clean the canister or allow it to get wet. Rinse the actuator under warm water for about 30 seconds then turn upside down and rinse again.  Allow actuator to dry overnight. Repeat priming of the inhaler after cleaning by shaking well and releasing 2 test sprays into the air.
Formoterol/mometasone: Test spray 4 times into the air (away from face) before initial use or if not used for >5 days; shake well before each test spray and each inhalation. Clean inhaler every 7 days by wiping mouthpiece with a dry cloth; do not wash inhaler in water.
Dosage
Each 2-mL single-dose vial of formoterol fumarate oral inhalation solution (Perforomist) contains 20 mcg of formoterol fumarate. Dilution not required prior to administration by nebulization.

Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
Use of Fixed Combinations
When formoterol used in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone, consider cautions, precautions, contraindications, and interactions associated with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone.  
Asthma-related Death and Serious Asthma-related Events
Increased risk of asthma-related death reported with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., formoterol) when used as monotherapy.       Data from clinical trials also suggest that use of long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents.  
Use of long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, including formoterol, alone for treatment of asthma without concomitant use of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) is contraindicated because of increased risk of asthma-related death and hospitalization.  
Use long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, including formoterol, only as additional therapy in patients with asthma currently receiving long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) but whose disease is inadequately controlled with such therapy.
Use formoterol/budesonide and formoterol/mometasone only in patients with asthma not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy, (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity clearly warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist.  (See Bronchospasm in Asthma under Uses.)
Large safety study (Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial [SMART]) showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol.         While no adequate studies conducted to determine whether the rate of asthma-related death is increased with formoterol, data suggest a higher incidence of serious asthma exacerbations with formoterol compared with placebo.  Increased risk of asthma-related death with use of salmeterol as monotherapy is considered a class effect of the long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, including formoterol.   
Based on review of 4 clinical trials (3 in adults and adolescents and 1 in children), FDA concluded there is no clinically important increased risk of serious asthma-related events (i.e., asthma-related hospitalization, intubation, death) associated with use of fixed-combination therapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids compared with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone for the treatment of asthma.     These studies also showed that fixed-combination therapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids reduced the incidence of asthma exacerbations compared with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone.    
No adequate studies conducted to determine whether the rate of death is increased in patients with COPD receiving long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists.
Acute Exacerbations of Asthma or COPD
Do not initiate formoterol in patients with acutely deteriorating or substantially worsening asthma, which may be life-threatening; fatalities reported with orally inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.  Do not initiate formoterol in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone in patients with rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD.  
Failure to respond to a previously effective dosage may indicate substantially worsening asthma or destabilization of COPD that requires prompt reevaluation.     Promptly reevaluate asthma therapy if inadequate control of symptoms persists despite supplemental short-acting β2-agonist bronchodilator therapy (i.e., need to increase dose or frequency of administration).   Reevaluation of asthma therapy may require dosage adjustment of inhaled corticosteroid or initiation of systemic corticosteroids.  Do not use extra or increased doses of formoterol in such situations.
If asthma deteriorates in patients receiving formoterol in fixed combination with budesonide or mometasone, prompt reevaluation of asthma therapy is required with special consideration given to the possible need for increasing the strength of the fixed combination (higher strengths contain higher dosages of budesonide or mometasone only), adding additional inhaled corticosteroids, or initiating systemic corticosteroids; do not increase the frequency of administration of formoterol/budesonide or formoterol/mometasone. 
Do not use formoterol/budesonide or formoterol/mometasone to relieve symptoms of acute asthma and do not use formoterol/glycopyrrolate to treat acutely deteriorating COPD.      Use a short-acting, inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist intermittently (as needed) for acute symptoms of asthma or COPD.      
When initiating formoterol alone or in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone, discontinue regular use (e.g., 4 times daily) of short-acting, inhaled β2-agonists and use only for relief of acute asthma or COPD symptoms.   
Serious exacerbations, including fatalities, reported in patients receiving formoterol.
Excessive Doses
Possible fatalities and/or serious cardiovascular effects reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs.   
Do not use additional formoterol or other long-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists for any reason in patients receiving formoterol alone or in fixed combination with budesonide, glycopyrrolate, or mometasone.   
Concomitant Anti-inflammatory Therapy
No data available demonstrating clinical anti-inflammatory effects of formoterol expected to substitute for or allow reduction in dosage of corticosteroids.  
Particular care is needed for patients transferring from systemic to orally inhaled corticosteroids since death resulting from adrenal insufficiency occurred in some asthmatic patients during and after such transfer. 
Cardiovascular Effects
Possible clinically important changes in SBP and/or DBP, heart rate, and ECG (e.g., flattening of T wave, prolongation of QTc interval, ST-segment depression) changes.      May require discontinuance of the drug.    Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.   
Nervous System Effects
Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders.   
Paradoxical Bronchospasm
Possible acute, life-threatening bronchospasm may occur immediately upon inhalation of formoterol.    Discontinue therapy immediately and institute alternative therapy.   
Sensitivity Reactions
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, urticaria, angioedema, rash, flushing, allergic dermatitis, bronchospasm) reported.    Discontinue formoterol/glycopyrrolate immediately if such allergic reactions occur, particularly angioedema (e.g., difficulties with breathing or swallowing; swelling of the tongue, lips, or face), urticaria, or rash; consider alternative therapy.
General Precautions
Metabolic Effects
Possible clinically important changes in blood glucose; possible clinically important decreases in serum potassium.    Hypokalemia is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.   
Use with caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis and in those unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.   
Specific Populations
Pregnancy

glatiramer,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
Treatment of patients with relapsing forms of MS (e.g., relapsing-remitting MS [RRMS]).         
Glatiramer acetate is one of several disease-modifying therapies used in the management of RRMS.  Although not curative, these therapies have all been shown to modify several measures of disease activity, including relapse rates, new or enhancing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and disability progression. 
The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) recommends that disease-modifying therapy be offered to patients with RRMS who have had recent relapses and/or MRI activity. Clinicians should consider adverse effects, tolerability, method of administration, safety, efficacy, and cost of the drugs in addition to patient preferences when selecting an appropriate therapy. 
Clinical experience suggests that efficacy of glatiramer acetate is generally similar to that of interferon beta.   Efficacy of glatiramer acetate compared with other disease-modifying therapies (e.g., fingolimod, mitoxantrone, natalizumab) not fully evaluated to date.  
",,"Administration
Administer only by sub-Q injection; do not administer IV.
Administer initial self-administered dose under supervision of a qualified clinician.
Several preparations of glatiramer acetate are commercially available (e.g., Copaxone, Glatopa and other generic preparations), and there are 2 available dosage strengths.    The 20-mg/mL injection is administered once daily and the 40-mg/mL injection is administered 3 times a week; the 2 dosage strengths are not interchangeable.
Sub-Q Administration
Commercially available prefilled syringes intended for single use only; discard unused portion.
Allow prefilled syringes to reach room temperature by removing from refrigerator about 20 minutes prior to use. 
Inject sub-Q into the arm, abdomen, hip, or thigh.  
To minimize risk of localized lipoatrophy and skin necrosis, follow proper injection technique and rotate injection areas and sites with each injection.  (See Lipoatrophy and Skin Necrosis under Cautions.)
Dosage
Available as glatiramer acetate; dosage expressed in terms of the salt.
Adults
Multiple Sclerosis
Sub-Q
Dosage recommendations differ based on dosage strength (20 or 40 mg/mL) used. Dosage strengths are not interchangeable.
If using the 20-mg/mL injection, recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily. 
If using the 40-mg/mL injection, recommended dosage is 40 mg 3 times a week (administer injections at least 48 hours apart).
Special Populations
No special population dosage recommendations at this time. 
",,,"Contraindications


Known hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol.


Warnings/Precautions
Sensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity Reactions
Injection site hypersensitivity, allergic reactions, and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions reported,     including rare cases of anaphylaxis accompanied by anti-glatiramer IgE antibodies.  Some reactions developed from one to several months or more after initiating therapy. 
General Precautions
Post-injection Reaction
Acute injection reactions reported in some patients immediately after sub-Q injection. Symptoms, which are generally transient and self-limited and do not require treatment, include flushing,    chest pain   or tightness,   palpitations,      anxiety,      dyspnea,      constriction of the throat, tachycardia, and urticaria. 
Reactions generally occur several months after initiation of therapy (although may occur earlier); individual patients may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms.   During the postmarketing period, some patients with similar symptoms reportedly received emergency medical care.
Not currently known whether reactions have an immunologic or nonimmunologic mechanism or whether multiple episodes in a given patient have similar mechanisms. 
Chest Pain
Transient chest pain reported, generally >1 month after initiation of therapy. Some episodes occurred as part of immediate post-injection reactions, but many did not. Episodes generally last only a few minutes, often are not associated with other symptoms, and do not appear to produce clinically important sequelae. Some patients experience >1 such episode.
Lipoatrophy and Skin Necrosis
Localized lipoatrophy (i.e., loss of subcutaneous fat) and, rarely, skin necrosis at the injection site reported.    Lipoatrophy may occur at various times after treatment initiation, sometimes after several months and is thought to be permanent.  No known treatment for lipoatrophy. 
Advise patients to follow proper injection technique and rotate injection areas and sites daily to minimize risk of these events.
Potential Effects on Immune Response
Possible modification of immune response and interference with useful immune function.
Possible interference with the recognition of foreign antigens, which may undermine the body’s tumor surveillance ability and defenses against infection.
Possibility of adverse effects resulting from continued alteration of cellular immunity associated with chronic administration of the drug.
Antibody Formation
Development of IgG antibodies to glatiramer reported in most patients;  however, data to date indicate that antibodies do not neutralize therapeutic effects.  
Animal studies suggest that immune complexes are deposited in renal glomeruli.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category B.
Lactation
Not known whether glatiramer is distributed into milk. Use with caution in nursing women.
Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy not established in pediatric patients <18 years of age.
Geriatric Use
Not studied in geriatric patients.
Common Adverse Effects
20-mg/mL injection: Injection site reactions    (e.g., pain,  erythema,   inflammation,  pruritus,   mass,  edema, hypersensitivity, fibrosis, atrophy or lipoatrophy,  necrosis), vasodilatation, rash,  dyspnea, chest pain.
40-mg/mL injection: Injection site reactions.
","Interactions with other drugs not fully evaluated to date.
No clinically important interactions reported in clinical trials between glatiramer and drugs commonly used in multiple sclerosis, including concurrent corticosteroid therapy for up to 28 days. Not formally evaluated in combination with interferon beta. 
","Distribution
Following sub-Q injection, some portion of the dose may enter the lymphatic circulation and some may enter systemic circulation. Does not appear to cross the blood-brain barrier.
Elimination
Metabolism
Substantial portion of sub-Q dose appears to be hydrolyzed locally at injection site to small oligopeptides and free amino acids. 
","

Importance of reading the manufacturer’s patient information prior to beginning glatiramer acetate therapy and each time prescription is refilled.


Importance of clinicians instructing patients and/or caregivers in proper injection techniques (including use of aseptic technique) and about avoiding reuse of syringes and needles and proper disposal of such equipment.


Risk of post-injection reaction. Importance of advising patients that glatiramer acetate may cause various symptoms after injection, including flushing, chest pain, palpitations, anxiety, dyspnea, throat constriction, and urticaria. Importance of informing patients that these symptoms usually are transient and self-limited and do not require specific treatment. However, patients should be advised to contact their clinician immediately if any serious reactions (e.g., flushing, chest pain, tachycardia, anxiety, breathing difficulties or tightness in the throat, swelling, rash, hives, itching) occur immediately after injection. Patients also should be informed that such reactions may occur early or begin several months after initiation of treatment, and that they may experience one or several episodes of these symptoms.


Importance of advising patients that they may experience chest pain either as part of a post-injection reaction or in isolation. Patients should be informed that the pain should be transient (usually lasting only for a few minutes). Some patients may experience more than one such episode, usually beginning at least one month after beginning treatment. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience chest pain of unusual duration or intensity.


Risk of lipoatrophy and skin necrosis at injection site.    Advise patients to follow proper injection technique and rotate injection areas and sites with each injection.


Importance of informing patients of the recommended storage instructions for glatiramer acetate (see Storage under Stability). Importance of advising patients not to expose the drug to higher temperatures, freezing temperatures, or to intense light.


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.


Importance of patient informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs, as well as any concomitant illnesses.


Importance of informing patients of other important precautionary information. (See Cautions.)

glycerin,"Glycerin , when taken by mouth, is used to treat certain conditions in which there is increased eye pressure, such as glaucoma. It may also be used before eye surgery to reduce pressure in the eye.
Glycerin may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor.
Glycerin is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For glycerin, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to glycerin or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Although there is no specific information comparing use of glycerin in children with use in other age groups, glycerin is not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than it does in adults.
Geriatric
Glycerin reduces water in the body, and there may be an increased risk that elderly patients taking it could become dehydrated.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking glycerin, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.
Using glycerin with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of glycerin. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Type 2 diabetes mellitus—Use of glycerin may increase the chance of dehydration (loss of too much body water)


Confused mental states or
Heart disease or
Kidney disease—Glycerin may make these conditions worse

","It is very important that you take glycerin only as directed. Do not take more of it and do not take it more often than your doctor ordered.
To improve the taste of glycerin, mix it with a small amount of unsweetened lemon, lime, or orange juice, pour over cracked ice, and sip through a straw.
Dosing
The dose of glycerin will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of glycerin. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage form (oral solution):

To lower pressure in the eye:

Adults—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 1 to 2 grams per kilogram (kg) (0.45 to 0.91 grams per pound) of body weight taken one time. Then, additional doses of 500 milligrams (mg) per kg (227 mg per pound) of body weight every six hours may be taken if needed.
Children—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 1 to 1.5 grams per kg (0.45 to 0.68 grams per pound) of body weight taken one time. The dose may be repeated in four to eight hours if needed.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of glycerin, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.

hydrocodone-and-acetaminophen,"Hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated.
Acetaminophen is used to relieve pain and reduce fever in patients. It does not become habit-forming when taken for a long time. But acetaminophen may cause other unwanted effects when taken in large doses, including liver damage.
Hydrocodone belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). It acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain, and stops or prevents cough.
When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For hydrocodone and acetaminophen, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to hydrocodone and acetaminophen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination capsules and tablets in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination oral solution in children 2 years of age and older. However, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 2 years of age.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have confusion and drowsiness, and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking hydrocodone and acetaminophen, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.
Using hydrocodone and acetaminophen with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.

Nalmefene
Naltrexone

","Take hydrocodone and acetaminophen only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. This is especially important for elderly patients, who may be more sensitive to the effects of pain medicines. If too much of hydrocodone and acetaminophen is taken for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence) or cause an overdose. Large amounts of acetaminophen may cause liver damage.
It is very important that you understand the rules of the Opioid Analgesic REMS program to prevent addiction, abuse, and misuse of hydrocodone and acetaminophen combination. Hydrocodone and acetaminophen should also come with a Medication Guide and patient information leaflet. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Read it again each time you refill your prescription in case there is new information. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.
Measure the oral liquid with a marked measuring spoon, oral syringe, dropper, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.
This combination medicine contains acetaminophen (Tylenol®). Carefully check the labels of all other medicines you are using, because they may also contain acetaminophen. It is not safe to use more than 4 grams (4,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen in one day (24 hours).
Dosing
The dose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label.

Missed dose
If you miss a dose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
If you miss a dose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen oral solution or Norco®, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Hydrocodone can cause serious unwanted effects or fatal overdose if taken by children, pets, or adults who are not used to strong narcotic pain medicines. Make sure you store the medicine in a safe and secure place to prevent others from getting it.
Drop off any unused narcotic medicine at a drug take-back location right away. If you do not have a drug take-back location near you, flush any unused narcotic medicine down the toilet. Check your local drug store and clinics for take-back locations. You can also check the DEA web site for locations. Here is the link to the FDA safe disposal of medicines website: www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/buyingusingmedicinesafely/ensuringsafeuseofmedicine/safedisposalofmedicines/ucm186187.htm .
","It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress while using hydrocodone and acetaminophen, especially within the first 24 to 72 hours of treatment. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you or your child should continue to take it. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
Do not use hydrocodone and acetaminophen if you are using or have used an MAO inhibitor (eg, isocarboxazid [Marplan®], linezolid [Zyvox®], phenelzine [Nardil®], selegiline [Eldepryl®], tranylcypromine [Parnate®]) within the past 14 days.
It is against the law and dangerous for anyone else to use your medicine. Keep your unused tablets in a safe and secure place. People who are addicted to drugs might want to steal hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen will add to the effects of alcohol and other CNS depressants (medicines that can make you drowsy or less alert). Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicine, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. Also, there may be a greater risk of liver damage if you drink three or more alcoholic beverages while you are taking acetaminophen. Do not drink alcoholic beverages, and check with your doctor before taking any of these medicines while you are using hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose.
If you think you or someone else may have taken an overdose of hydrocodone and acetaminophen, get emergency help at once. Signs of an overdose include: dark urine, difficult or trouble breathing, irregular, fast or slow, or shallow breathing, nausea, vomiting, pain in the upper stomach, pale or blue lips, fingernails, or skin, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, or yellow eyes or skin.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen may cause sleep-related breathing problems (eg, sleep apnea, sleep-related hypoxemia). Your doctor may decrease your dose if you have sleep apnea (stop breathing for short periods during sleep) while using hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Check with your doctor right away if you have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem.
Serious skin reactions can occur with hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Check with your doctor right away if you have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills while you are using hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Hydrocodone and acetaminophen may make you dizzy, drowsy, or lightheaded. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how hydrocodone and acetaminophen affects you.
Using narcotics for a long time can cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may direct you or your child to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems.
Before you or your child have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are taking hydrocodone and acetaminophen. The results of certain tests may be affected by hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Do not change your dose or suddenly stop using hydrocodone and acetaminophen without first checking with your doctor. Your doctor may want you or your child to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely. This may help prevent worsening of your condition and reduce the possibility of withdrawal symptoms, such as stomach cramps, anxiety, fever, nausea, runny nose, sweating, tremors, or trouble with sleeping.
Using hydrocodone and acetaminophen while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects, including neonatal withdrawal syndrome in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if your child has the following symptoms: an abnormal sleep pattern, diarrhea, a high-pitched cry, irritability, shakiness or tremors, sneezing, weight loss, vomiting, yawning, or failure to gain weight. Check with your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using hydrocodone and acetaminophen.
Check with your doctor right away if you have anxiety, restlessness, a fast heartbeat, fever, sweating, muscle spasms, twitching, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or see or hear things that are not there. These may be symptoms of a serious condition called serotonin syndrome. Your risk may be higher if you also take certain other medicines that affect serotonin levels in your body.
Using too much of hydrocodone and acetaminophen may cause infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using hydrocodone and acetaminophen if you plan to have children.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:

ibandronate,"Osteoporosis
Prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis and related fractures include early menopause, advanced age, low bone mineral density (BMD), low body mass index (BMI), previous fracture or family history of fracture/osteoporosis, excessive alcohol intake, smoking, inadequate physical activity, low calcium and vitamin D intake, certain drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids), and medical conditions or diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus, Cushing syndrome, hyperparathyroidism). 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.  
In addition to adequate intake of calcium/vitamin D and other lifestyle modifications (e.g., exercise, avoidance of excessive alcohol and tobacco use), experts recommend that pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis be considered in postmenopausal women with previous hip or vertebral fractures or low BMD; pharmacologic therapy also may be considered in postmenopausal women with low bone mass, although there is less evidence supporting overall fracture risk reduction in such patients. 
Use of a drug with proven efficacy in reducing fracture risk is recommended; bisphosphonates (e.g., alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, ibandronate) are recommended as one of several first-line drugs. 
Individualize choice of therapy based on potential benefits (with respect to fracture risk reduction) and adverse effects of therapy, patient preferences, comorbidities, and risk factors. 
Glucocorticoid-induced Osteoporosis
Also has been used in the management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis†. 
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommends optimizing calcium and vitamin D intake and lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, smoking cessation, weight-bearing or resistance-training exercise) in all patients receiving long-term glucocorticoid therapy; in addition, pharmacologic therapy with an oral bisphosphonate is recommended in patients who are considered to be at moderate-to-high risk of fracture. Oral bisphosphonates generally are preferred because of their demonstrated antifracture benefits, safety, and low cost.
",,"General


Correct hypocalcemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism prior to initiation of therapy.


Provide supplemental calcium and vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate.


Administration
Oral Administration
Administer orally with a full glass (180–240 mL) of plain water ≥60 minutes prior to the first food, beverage (other than plain water), or other orally administered drug or supplement (including vitamins, antacids, and calcium) of the day.   (See Food under Pharmacokinetics.)
Avoid lying down for ≥60 minutes following administration.
Do not to suck or chew tablets; potential for oropharyngeal ulceration. (See Upper GI Effects under Cautions.)
If a morning daily oral dose is missed, do not take missed dose later that same day. Resume the regular schedule the next day.
When administered monthly, take tablets in the morning on the same day each month. If a monthly dose is missed and the next scheduled dose is more than 7 days away, take the missed dose the next morning after it is remembered and resume the regular schedule. If the next scheduled dose is 1–7 days away, maintain the regular schedule; do not take more than one 150-mg tablet within the same week.
IV Administration
Administer by IV injection once every 3 months by a health-care professional. 
Injection must only be administered IV.  Safety and efficacy of IV injection administered by other routes not established.
Because of the risk of anaphylaxis or other severe hypersensitivity reactions, appropriate medical support should be readily available during IV administration. (See Hypersensitivity under Cautions.)
If a dose is missed, reschedule administration with a health-care professional as soon as possible. Schedule subsequent injections at 3-month intervals; should not be administered more often than once every 3 months.
Administration Risks
Take care to avoid intra-arterial or paravenous injection as such administration could result in tissue damage.
Rate of Administration
Administer IV over a period of 15–30 seconds.
Dosage
Available as ibandronate sodium (as the monosodium monohydrate); dosage expressed in terms of ibandronate. 
Adults
Osteoporosis
Prevention in Postmenopausal Women
150 mg once monthly.
Osteoporosis
Treatment in Postmenopausal Women
150 mg once monthly.
Optimal duration of treatment not established. Safety and efficacy based on data over 3 years. Reevaluate need for continued therapy periodically in all patients receiving bisphosphonates. Consider discontinuance of bisphosphonate therapy after 3–5 years in patients at low risk of fracture. Evaluate fracture risk periodically in patients who discontinue therapy.
IV
3 mg once every 3 months.
Optimal duration of treatment not established. Safety and efficacy of IV ibandronate based on data supporting fracture reduction over 1 year of treatment. Reevaluate need for continued therapy periodically in all patients receiving bisphosphonates. Consider discontinuance of bisphosphonate therapy after 3–5 years in patients at low risk of fracture. Evaluate fracture risk periodically in patients who discontinue therapy.
Special Populations
Renal Impairment
Oral or IV
Dosage adjustments not necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Clcr ≥30 mL/minute); use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr <30 mL/minute).   
",,,"Contraindications


Oral: Esophageal abnormalities that delay esophageal emptying (e.g., stricture, achalasia).


Oral and IV: Uncorrected hypocalcemia. 
Oral and IV: Known hypersensitivity to ibandronate or any ingredient in the formulation. 


Oral: Inability to stand or sit upright for ≥60 minutes.


Warnings/Precautions
Upper GI Effects
Possible severe adverse esophageal effects (e.g., esophagitis, esophageal ulcers, erosions, strictures, perforation).  (See Oral Administration under Dosage and Administration.) Monitor for any manifestations and discontinue if dysphagia, odynophagia, new or worsening heartburn, or retrosternal pain occurs.
Use with caution in patients with active upper GI disease (e.g., Barrett’s esophagus, dysphagia, other esophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers). Gastric and duodenal ulcers (some severe and with complications) reported during postmarketing experience.
Route of Administration
Injection must be administered IV by a health-care professional; do not administer by non-IV (e.g., intra-arterial) routes. (See Administration Risks under Dosage and Administration.)
Metabolic Effects
Correct hypocalcemia, hypovitaminosis D, and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism before initiating therapy.  
If daily intake inadequate, administer supplemental calcium and vitamin D. 
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw
Osteonecrosis and osteomyelitis of the jaw reported in patients receiving bisphosphonates.   Most cases associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing. Known risk factors include cancer, concomitant therapies (e.g., chemotherapy, corticosteroids, angiogenesis inhibitors), poor oral hygiene, and comorbid disorders (e.g., periodontal and/or other preexisting dental disease, anemia, coagulopathy, infection, ill-fitting dentures). Risk also may be increased with increased duration of bisphosphonate use.
If osteonecrosis of the jaw develops, consult an oral surgeon for treatment. Dental surgery may exacerbate condition.
In patients requiring dental procedures, discontinuance of therapy prior to procedure may reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw. Base management of patients requiring dental treatment on an individual assessment of risks and benefits.
Musculoskeletal Pain
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint, and/or muscle pain reported infrequently with bisphosphonate therapy.   Time to onset varied from 1 day to years (mean onset about 3 months) after treatment initiation.   If severe symptoms occur, consider discontinuing drug. Such pain generally improves following discontinuance, but may recur upon subsequent rechallenge with the same drug or another bisphosphonate.  
Atypical Fracture of the Femur
Atypical (subtrochanteric or diaphyseal) femur fractures reported rarely with long-term use (>3 years) of bisphosphonates, mostly in patients receiving these drugs for osteoporosis.    Often occurs with minimal or no trauma, and may be bilateral.     Causality not established; atypical fractures also occur in osteoporotic patients not receiving bisphosphonates.    Risk may be increased with concomitant use of glucocorticoid, estrogen, and proton-pump inhibitor therapy.   
Evaluate patients who present with new thigh or groin pain for possibility of an atypical femoral fracture; include assessment of the contralateral limb.    Consider interruption of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with manifestations of possible femoral fracture; weigh risks versus benefits of continued treatment.   Discontinue if a femoral shaft fracture is confirmed.  
Atrial Fibrillation
Although data are conflicting, possible increased risk of atrial fibrillation with use of bisphosphonates.   FDA analysis of data from long-term (6 months to 3 years) controlled trials identified a higher rate of atrial fibrillation in patients receiving bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) versus placebo; however, only a few events reported in each study. FDA is continuing to monitor this safety concern.
Potential Risk of Esophageal Cancer
Some evidence (from postmarketing experience and observational studies) suggests a possible association between use of oral bisphosphonates and an increased risk of esophageal cancer.   However, because of conflicting data,   additional study needed to confirm such findings.
FDA states that benefits of oral bisphosphonates continue to outweigh their potential risks in patients with osteoporosis; it is important to consider that esophageal cancer is rare, especially in women. 
Avoidance of oral bisphosphonates in patients with Barrett’s esophagus, a known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma, has been recommended.
Renal Effects
Possible renal toxicity (e.g., deterioration of renal function and, rarely, renal failure) with bisphosphonates.  Risk may be greater in patients with coexisting conditions associated with renal impairment, concomitant therapy with other nephrotoxic drugs, preexisting renal disease, dehydration, dosage, infusion volume and rate, and multiple cycles of treatment.     Assess renal function in such patients.
Use not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr <30 mL/minute). 
Measure Scr prior to each IV dose. Withhold treatment if deterioration of renal function occurs.
Sensitivity Reactions
Hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity reactions, including fatal anaphylaxis in patients who received ibandronate injection, reported.  (See Contraindications under Cautions and see IV Administration under Dosage and Administration.)

iron-sucrose,"Iron Deficiency Anemia in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease
Treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those who are undergoing dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal) and those who do not require dialysis.        
In patients with CKD on hemodialysis, IV iron superior to orally administered iron in increasing hemoglobin concentrations and/or minimizing dosage of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA); the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines state that the IV route of iron administration is preferred in such patients.
Available data suggest that iron sucrose and sodium ferric gluconate may be associated less frequently with serious adverse effects (e.g., hypersensitivity reactions) than iron dextran.   
Iron sucrose injection also used as iron maintenance therapy in children with dialysis-dependent (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) or non-dialysis-dependent CKD. (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.)
",,"General


Although manufacturer makes no specific recommendations regarding test doses, test doses of iron sucrose (20–25 or 50 mg) have been administered in some patients.    (See Sensitivity Reactions under Cautions.)


Ensure immediate availability of personnel trained to provide emergency treatment and appropriate agents for the treatment of a severe allergic or anaphylactic reaction when administering iron sucrose injection.

Possible hypotension associated with IV administration; may be minimized by adhering to recommended total doses and rates of administration. (See Dosage and Administration.)
General Precautions
Iron Toxicity
Do not administer in patients with evidence suggesting iron overload because body iron excretion is limited and excessive iron in tissues can be hazardous. Periodically monitor laboratory values indicative of iron storage in the body (e.g., transferrin saturation, serum ferritin concentrations, hemoglobin, hematocrit) to detect iron accumulation.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category B.
Lactation
Not known whether iron sucrose is distributed into milk; use caution in nursing women.
Pediatric Use
Efficacy and safety for iron maintenance therapy established in pediatric patients ≥2 years of age with dialysis-dependent or non-dialysis-dependent CKD.
Safety and efficacy for iron replacement therapy in pediatric patients with CKD not established.
Geriatric Use
Insufficient experience in patients ≥65 years of age to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently than younger adults; use caution in dosage selection and adjustment.
Concomitant Disease States
Clinical studies generally excluded patients with serious underlying disease, inflammatory conditions, or active infections; use with caution.  
Common Adverse Effects
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, hypotension, pruritus, extremity pain, arthralgia, back pain, muscle cramp, injection site reactions, chest pain, peripheral edema.
","Oral Iron Preparations
No formal drug interaction studies to date.
Like other parenteral iron preparations, iron sucrose injection may be expected to reduce absorption of concomitantly administered oral iron.
","Distribution
Extent
Distributed into liver, spleen, and bone marrow.
Elimination
Metabolism
Following IV administration, dissociated into iron and sucrose by the reticuloendothelial system.
Elimination Route
Sucrose component is eliminated mainly by urinary excretion.
Half-life
6 hours.
Special Populations
Serum clearance of iron expected to be more rapid in iron-deficient patients than in healthy individuals.
","

Risk of potentially fatal sensitivity (e.g., anaphylactoid) reactions. 


Risk of hypotension.


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.


Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs.

isosorbide-mononitrate,"Isosorbide mononitrate is used to prevent angina (chest pain) caused by coronary artery disease (heart disease). It does not work fast enough to relieve the pain of an angina attack that has already started.
Isosorbide mononitrate belongs to the group of medicines called nitrates. It works by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart while reducing its workload. When used regularly on a long-term basis, this helps prevent angina attacks from occurring.
Isosorbide mononitrate is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For isosorbide mononitrate, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to isosorbide mononitrate or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of isosorbide mononitrate in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of isosorbide mononitrate in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have severe low blood pressure and age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving isosorbide mononitrate.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking isosorbide mononitrate, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.
Using isosorbide mononitrate with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take.

Avanafil
Riociguat
Sildenafil
Tadalafil
Vardenafil

Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of isosorbide mononitrate. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Allergy to nitrates (eg, amyl nitrate, butyl nitrate) and nitrites—Should not be used in patients with these conditions.


Congestive heart failure or
Heart attack, recent or
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a heart disease) or
Hypotension (low blood pressure) or
Hypovolemia (low amount of blood)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.

","Take isosorbide mononitrate exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
This form of nitrate is used to reduce the number of angina attacks over a long time. It will not relieve an attack that has already started because it works too slowly. The extended-release form gradually releases medicine to provide its effect for 8 to 10 hours. Check with your doctor if you also need a fast-acting medicine to relieve the pain of an angina attack.
You should take isosorbide mononitrate first thing in the morning and follow the same schedule each day. Isosorbide mononitrate works best if you have a ""drug-free"" period of time every day when you do not take it. Your doctor will schedule your doses during the day to allow for a drug-free time. Follow the schedule of dosing carefully so the medicine will work properly.
Swallow the extended-release tablet whole with a half glass of water. Do not split, crush, or chew it.
Dosing
The dose of isosorbide mononitrate will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of isosorbide mononitrate. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For prevention of angina:

For oral dosage form (extended-release tablets):

Adults—At first, 30 or 60 milligrams (mg) once a day. Take the dose in the morning right after you wake up. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.


For oral dosage form (tablets):

Adults—20 milligrams (mg) two times a day. Take the first dose in the morning right after you wake up, and the second dose 7 hours later.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of isosorbide mononitrate, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
","If you will be taking isosorbide mononitrate for a long time, it is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that isosorbide mononitrate is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
Do not take riociguat (Adempas®), sildenafil (Viagra®), tadalafil (Cialis®), or vardenafil (Levitra®) while you are using isosorbide mononitrate. Using these medicines together may lower your blood pressure and cause blurred vision, dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. If you are taking these medicines and you experience an angina attack, you must go to the hospital right away.
Isosorbide mononitrate may cause headaches. These headaches are a sign that the medicine is working. Do not stop using the medicine or change the time you use it in order to avoid the headaches. If you have severe pain, talk with your doctor.
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or faintness may occur, especially when you get up quickly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help.
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting is also more likely to occur if you drink alcohol, stand for long periods of time, exercise, or if the weather is hot. While you are taking isosorbide mononitrate, be careful to limit the amount of alcohol you drink. Also, use extra care during exercise or hot weather or if you must stand for long periods of time.
Do not stop using isosorbide mononitrate without checking first with your doctor. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are using before stopping it completely.
Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using isosorbide mononitrate. You may need to stop using isosorbide mononitrate several days before you have medical tests.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

junel-1-20,"Ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone combination is used to prevent pregnancy. It is a birth control pill that contains two types of hormones, ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone, and when taken properly, prevents pregnancy. It works by stopping a woman's egg from fully developing each month. The egg can no longer accept a sperm and fertilization (pregnancy) is prevented.
No contraceptive method is 100 percent effective. Birth control methods, such as having surgery to become sterile or not having sex are more effective than birth control pills. Discuss your options for birth control with your doctor.
This medicine does not prevent HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases. It will not help as emergency contraception, such as after unprotected sexual contact.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone combination have not been performed in the pediatric population. However, pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of this medication in teenagers are not expected. This medicine may be used for birth control in teenage females but should not be used before the start of menstruation.
Geriatric
No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone combination in the geriatric patients.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

It is very important that you use this medicine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, do not use it more often, and do not use it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
To make using oral contraceptives as safe and reliable as possible, you should understand how and when to take them and what effects may be expected.
This medicine comes with patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.
This medicine is available in blister packs with a Dialpak® tablet dispenser. Each blister pack contains 28 tablets with different colors that need to be taken in the same order as directed on the blister pack.
When you begin using this medicine, your body will require at least 7 days to adjust before a pregnancy will be prevented. Use a second form of contraception, such as a condom, spermicide, or diaphragm, for the first 7 days of your first cycle of pills.
Take this medicine at the same time each day (with meals or at bedtime). Birth control pills work best when no more than 24 hours pass between doses.
Do not skip or delay taking your pill by more than 24 hours. If you miss a dose, you could get pregnant. Ask your doctor for ways to help you remember to take your pills or about using another method of birth control.
You may feel sick or nauseated, especially during the first few months that you take this medicine. If your nausea is continuous and does not go away, call your doctor.

The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.
Your doctor may ask you to begin your dose on the first day of your menstrual period (called Day 1 start) or on the first Sunday after your menstrual period starts (called Sunday start). When you begin on a certain day it is important that you follow that schedule, even if you miss a dose. Do not change your schedule on your own. If the schedule that you use is not convenient, check with your doctor about changing it. For a Sunday start, you need to use another form of birth control (eg, condom, diaphragm, spermicide) for the first 7 days.
You should begin your next and all subsequent 28-day regimens of therapy on the same day of the week as the first regimen began and follow the same schedule.

k-tab,"Potassium is needed to maintain good health. Although a balanced diet usually supplies all the potassium a person needs, potassium supplements may be needed by patients who do not have enough potassium in their regular diet or have lost too much potassium because of illness or treatment with certain medicines.
There is no evidence that potassium supplements are useful in the treatment of high blood pressure.
Lack of potassium may cause muscle weakness, irregular heartbeat, mood changes, or nausea and vomiting.
Injectable potassium is administered only by or under the supervision of your doctor. Some forms of oral potassium may be available in stores without a prescription. Since too much potassium may cause health problems, you should take potassium supplements only if directed by your doctor.
","If you are taking a dietary supplement without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label. For these supplements, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to medicines in this group or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Although there is no specific information comparing use of potassium supplements in children with use in other age groups, they are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in children than they do in adults.
Geriatric
Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults. Although there is no specific information comparing use of potassium supplements in the elderly with use in other age groups, they are not expected to cause different side effects or problems in older people than they do in younger adults.
Older adults may be at a greater risk of developing high blood levels of potassium (hyperkalemia).
Pregnancy
Potassium supplements have not been shown to cause problems in humans.
Breastfeeding
Potassium supplements pass into breast milk. However, this medicine has not been reported to cause problems in nursing babies.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

ketotifen,"Ketotifen is a type of asthma medication which, when taken every day and used along with other antiasthma medications, may reduce the frequency, severity, and duration of asthma symptoms or attacks in children. It may also lead to a reduction in daily requirements of other antiasthma medications. Ketotifen is not effective for the prevention or treatment of acute asthma attacks. Ketotifen works by inhibiting certain substances in the body that are known to cause inflammation and symptoms of asthma.
Ketotifen is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For ketotifen, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to ketotifen or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Ketotifen has been tested in children and, in effective doses, has not been shown to cause different side effects or problems than it does in adults.
Geriatric
Many medicines have not been studied specifically in older people. Therefore, it may not be known whether they work exactly the same way they do in younger adults or if they cause different side effects or problems in older people. There is no specific information comparing use of ketotifen in the elderly with use in other age groups.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking ketotifen, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.
Using ketotifen with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

Amifampridine
Bupropion
Donepezil
Pitolisant

Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of ketotifen. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes)—May alter low-sugar diet (syrup contains carbohydrates)


Epilepsy—May increase risk of convulsions (seizures)

","Make certain your health care professional knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sugar diet. The syrup contains carbohydrates.
Ketotifen is used to help prevent asthma attacks. It will not relieve an asthma attack that has already started.
Ketotifen must be taken continuously in order to be effective.
Continue taking your current asthma medications until instructed otherwise by your doctor.
Ketotifen may be taken with or without food.
Dosing
The dose of ketotifen will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of ketotifen. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage form (tablets and syrup):

For asthma:

Adults and children 3 years of age and older—The usual dose is 1 milligram (mg) (1 tablet or 5 milliliters [mL] of syrup) twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.
Infants and children from 6 months to 3 years of age—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by the doctor. It is usually 0.25 mL (50 mcg or 0.05 mg) of syrup per kilogram (kg) (110 micrograms [mcg] or 0.110 mg per pound) of body weight twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of ketotifen, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
","It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to take it. If your symptoms worsen, you should check with your doctor.
Ketotifen may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or less alert than they are normally. Make sure you know how you react to ketotifen before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or are not alert.
Ketotifen may cause some people to become excited, irritable, or nervous or to have trouble in sleeping. These are symptoms of central nervous system stimulation and are especially likely to occur in children.
For patients with diabetes:

The syrup form of ketotifen may affect blood sugar levels. If you notice a change in the results of your blood or urine sugar tests or if you have any questions, check with your doctor.

","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
Check with your doctor as soon as possible if any of the following side effects occur:
Less common

Chills
cough
diarrhea
fever
general feeling of discomfort or illness
headache
joint pain
loss of appetite
muscle aches and pains
nausea

latanoprost,"Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma
Latanoprost 0.005%: Reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.               
Appears to be more effective than unoprostone (not available in US), as effective as travoprost, and slightly less effective than bimatoprost in reducing IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.     
May be more effective or at least as effective as twice-daily administration of timolol 0.5% in reducing IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.         Appears to be more effective than thrice-daily administration of dorzolamide 2%. 
Tolerance does not occur, and reduction in mean IOP is maintained for up to at least 24 months of therapy after initial stabilization.        
Fixed-combination netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005%: Reduction of elevated IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. When administered once daily, mean IOP reduction was approximately 1–3 mm Hg greater than that achieved with once-daily administration of either drug alone. 
When selecting an initial ocular hypotensive agent, consider extent of the required IOP reduction, coexisting medical conditions, and drug characteristics (e.g., dosing frequency, adverse effects, cost).  With single-agent regimens, the reduction in IOP is approximately 25–33% with topical prostaglandin analogs; 20–25% with topical β-adrenergic blocking agents, α-adrenergic agonists, or miotic (parasympathomimetic) agents; 20–30% with oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; 18% with topical rho kinase inhibitors; and 15–20% with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. 
A prostaglandin analog frequently is considered for initial therapy in the absence of other considerations (e.g., contraindications, cost considerations, intolerance, adverse effects, patient refusal) because of relatively greater activity, once-daily administration, and low frequency of systemic adverse effects; however, ocular adverse effects can occur.   
Goal is to maintain an IOP at which visual field loss is unlikely to substantially reduce quality of life during the patient's lifetime. 
Reduction of pretreatment IOP by ≥25% shown to slow progression of primary open-angle glaucoma.  Set an initial target IOP (based on extent of optic nerve damage and/or visual field loss, baseline IOP at which damage occurred, rate of progression, life expectancy, and other considerations) and reduce IOP toward this goal.   Adjust target IOP up or down as needed over course of disease.  
Combination therapy with drugs from different therapeutic classes often required to control IOP. 
",,"Administration
Ophthalmic Administration
Apply topically to the affected eye(s) as an ophthalmic emulsion (latanoprost) or ophthalmic solution (latanoprost alone or in fixed combination with netarsudil).        
Avoid contamination of the dispensing container.   (See Bacterial Keratitis under Cautions.)
Remove contact lenses before administering each dose; may reinsert lenses 15 minutes after the dose.  
If more than one topical ophthalmic preparation is used, administer the preparations at least 5 minutes apart.  
Dosage
Adults
Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma
Ophthalmic
Latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution or emulsion: One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.       
Netarsudil 0.02% and latanoprost 0.005% ophthalmic solution: One drop in the affected eye(s) once daily in the evening.
More frequent dosing may diminish the IOP-lowering effect of latanoprost or cause paradoxical elevation of IOP.     
If target IOP not achieved, may initiate additional or alternative ocular hypotensive agents.   (See Ocular Hypertension and Glaucoma under Uses.) However, concomitant use of ≥2 prostaglandin analogs not recommended. 
If a dose is missed, continue the usual schedule with the next dose applied the following evening.   
Special Populations
No special population dosage recommendations at this time.  
",,,"Contraindications


Known hypersensitivity to latanoprost or any ingredient in the formulation (e.g., benzalkonium chloride). 


Warnings/Precautions
Pigmentation
Increased pigmentation of the iris and periorbital tissue (eyelid) reported.          Pigmentation expected to increase as long as latanoprost is administered. Following discontinuance of therapy, pigmentation of the iris is likely to be permanent, while pigmentation of periorbital tissue reportedly is reversible in some patients. Long-term effects (i.e., beyond 5 years) of increased pigmentation are unknown.
Increased pigmentation of iris may not be evident until after several months to years of latanoprost therapy. May continue therapy in patients who develop noticeably increased iris pigmentation; however, examine these patients regularly.  
Eyelash Changes
Possible gradual change in eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye, including increased length, thickness, pigmentation, and number of eyelashes and/or misdirected growth of eyelashes.          Usually reversible upon discontinuance of therapy.
Intraocular Inflammation
Use with caution in patients with a history of intraocular inflammation (e.g., iritis, uveitis); use generally not recommended in patients with active intraocular inflammation since latanoprost may exacerbate inflammation.
Macular Edema
Macular edema, including cystoid macular edema, reported in aphakic patients, in pseudophakic patients with a torn posterior lens capsule, or in patients with known risk factors for macular edema; use with caution in such patients.          
Herpetic Keratitis
Reactivation of herpes simplex keratitis reported. Use with caution in patients with a history of herpetic keratitis; avoid use in those with active herpes simplex keratitis since latanoprost may exacerbate inflammation.
Bacterial Keratitis
Bacterial keratitis reported with use of multiple-dose containers of topical ophthalmic preparations. Containers were inadvertently contaminated by patients, most of whom had concurrent corneal disease or disruption of the ocular epithelial surface.
Improper handling of ophthalmic solutions can result in contamination of the solution by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated ophthalmic solutions. (See Advice to Patients.)
Use with Contact Lenses
Remove contact lenses before administering each dose; may reinsert lenses 15 minutes after the dose.  
Use of Fixed Combinations
When used in fixed combination with netarsudil, consider the cautions, precautions, and contraindications associated with netarsudil.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category C. 
Use only if potential benefits justify possible risks to the fetus.  
Lactation
Not known whether latanoprost distributes into milk,   affects the breast-fed infant, or affects milk production.
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution or emulsion: Use with caution. 
Netarsudil and latanoprost fixed-combination ophthalmic solution: Consider developmental and health benefits of breast-feeding along with the mother's clinical need for the drugs and any potential adverse effects of the drugs on the breast-fed infant.
Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy not established in pediatric patients.   
Geriatric Use
No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults.     
Common Adverse Effects
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution: Foreign body sensation, punctate keratitis, ocular stinging, conjunctival hyperemia, blurred vision, ocular pruritus, ocular burning, increased pigmentation of the iris.
Latanoprost ophthalmic emulsion: Eye pain/stinging upon instillation, ocular hyperemia, conjunctival hyperemia, eye discharge, eyelash growth or thickening, ocular pruritus.
Netarsudil and latanoprost ophthalmic solution: Conjunctival hyperemia, instillation site pain, corneal verticillata, conjunctival hemorrhage, ocular pruritus, decreased visual acuity, increased lacrimation, instillation site discomfort, blurred vision.
","Specific Drugs
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Approximately 1% of a topically applied dose penetrates the human eye; remaining portion is absorbed into systemic circulation through blood vessels in the conjunctiva and mucous membranes of the nose, pharynx, esophagus, and GI tract. 
Prodrug; absorbed through the cornea following ocular instillation and rapidly hydrolyzed to active form (latanoprost acid).      Peak aqueous humor concentrations of latanoprost acid occur within 2 hours. 
Onset
Reduction in IOP generally occurs within 3–4 hours after topical application and peaks within 8–12 hours.
Duration
Effects on IOP generally persist for up to 24 hours or longer.      
Following long-term therapy (i.e., 6 months), pharmacologic effects may persist for at least 14 days after the drug is discontinued.
Distribution
Extent
The volume of distribution of latanoprost acid in humans following ocular or IV administration is 0.36 or 0.16 L/kg, respectively.  Latanoprost acid can be measured in aqueous humor during the first 4 hours, and in plasma only during the first hour after ocular instillation.
Not known whether the drug or its metabolites distribute into milk in humans.
Elimination
Metabolism
Rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases in the cornea and plasma to biologically active form (latanoprost acid).   
Systemically absorbed latanoprost acid is metabolized in the liver. 
Elimination Route
Metabolites are excreted principally in urine; however, biliary excretion also may occur.   Unchanged latanoprost or latanoprost acid generally are not recovered in urine or feces. Following topical administration of radiolabeled latanoprost to the eye, 88% of the dose was eliminated in urine.
Half-life
The elimination half-life of latanoprost acid from aqueous humor is approximately 3 hours.
Following topical application to the eye, the plasma elimination half-life of latanoprost acid is approximately 17 minutes.
","

Importance of not exceeding once-daily dosing; more frequent administration may decrease IOP-lowering effect of latanoprost.


Risk of permanent increase in brown pigmentation of the iris; risk of darkening of the skin around the eyes (eyelid), which may be reversible after discontinuance of latanoprost.


Risk of changes in eyelashes and vellus hair in the treated eye. Potential for disparity between eyes in length, thickness, pigmentation, or number of eyelashes or vellus hairs and/or direction of eyelash growth. Eyelash changes usually are reversible after discontinuance of latanoprost.


Importance of learning and adhering to proper administration techniques to avoid contamination of the ophthalmic preparation with common bacteria that can cause ocular infections. Instruct patients that the tip of the dispensing container should not touch the eye or surrounding structures, fingers, or any other surface.  Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated ophthalmic preparations.


Advise patients to immediately contact their clinician for advice regarding continued use of the ophthalmic preparation if an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma, infection) or ocular reaction (particularly conjunctivitis and eyelid reaction) develops or ocular surgery is planned. 


Importance of removing contact lenses before administering each dose and delaying reinsertion for at least 15 minutes after the dose.  


If using more than one topical ophthalmic preparation, importance of administering the preparations at least 5 minutes apart.  


Importance of informing clinician of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs, as well as any concomitant illnesses.


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or intend to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.


Importance of informing patients of other important precautionary information. (See Cautions.)

levetiracetam,"Levetiracetam is used to control certain types of seizures in the treatment of epilepsy. Levetiracetam cannot cure epilepsy and will only work to control seizures for as long as you continue to use it.
Levetiracetam is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For levetiracetam, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to levetiracetam or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of levetiracetam oral solution, tablets, or tablets for suspension in children younger than 1 month of age (Keppra®) or in children younger than 4 years of age and weighing less than 20 kilograms (Spritam®, Spritam® tablets for oral suspension), and levetiracetam extended-release tablets in children younger than 12 years of age (Elepsia™ XR) or (Keppra XR®). Safety and efficacy have not been established in these age groups.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of levetiracetam in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving levetiracetam.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking levetiracetam, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

Calcifediol
Methotrexate
Orlistat

Using levetiracetam with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

Carbamazepine
Ginkgo

Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of levetiracetam. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Depression, history of or
Hypertension (high blood pressure) or
Mental illness, history of—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.


Kidney disease, moderate to severe—Use is not recommended in patients with this condition.


Kidney problems—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.

","Take levetiracetam only as directed by your doctor, to help your condition as much as possible. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not change your dose without checking first with your doctor.
Levetiracetam comes with a Medication Guide. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.
Levetiracetam may be taken with or without food or on a full or empty stomach. However, if your doctor tells you to take the medicine a certain way, take it exactly as directed. You should try to take levetiracetam at the same time each day.
Swallow the tablet or the extended-release tablet whole. Do not break, crush, or chew it. There is an oral liquid form of levetiracetam if you or your child cannot swallow the tablets.
Elepsia™ XR extended-release tablet has a blue and white to off-white layer. If you do not see the blue or white, off-white layer, do not take the tablet.
A part of the tablet may also pass into your stool. This is normal and is nothing to worry about.
If you are using the Spritam® tablet or the Spritam® tablet for suspension, make sure your hands are dry before you handle the tablet. Do not open the blister pack that contains the tablet until you are ready to take it. Remove the tablet from the blister pack by peeling back the foil, then taking the tablet out. Do not push the tablet through the foil. Place the tablet on your tongue and take a sip of water. After it has melted, swallow.
You may also add one whole Spritam® tablet for suspension to a small volume of liquid in a cup (1 tablespoon or enough to cover the medicine), and swirl gently. Swallow right away after it has dissolved. Then add a small volume of liquid to cup again, swirl gently, and swallow the liquid.
Measure the oral liquid with a marked measuring spoon, dropper, oral syringe, or medicine cup. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid. If you have any questions about this, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Levetiracetam can be used with other seizure medicines. Keep using all of your seizure medicines unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
Take only the form of levetiracetam that your doctor prescribed. If you refill your prescription and your pills look different, do not take the medicine and tell your doctor or pharmacist right away.

Missed dose
If you miss a dose of levetiracetam, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
","It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits, especially for the first few months you or your child are using levetiracetam. This is necessary to allow dose adjustments and to reduce any unwanted effects.
Levetiracetam may cause changes in mood or behavior, problems with coordination, or unusual tiredness or weakness. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child start to feel depressed, anxious, angry, getting upset easily, restless, or have thoughts about hurting yourself. Report any unusual thoughts or behavior that trouble you, especially if they are new or getting worse quickly.
Levetiracetam may cause some people to become dizzy, drowsy, tired, or less alert than they are normally. Do not drive or do anything else that could be dangerous until you know how levetiracetam affects you.
Levetiracetam may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using levetiracetam.
Serious skin reactions can occur with levetiracetam. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have blistering, peeling, or loosening of the skin, red skin lesions, severe acne or skin rash, sores or ulcers on the skin, or fever or chills while you are using levetiracetam.
Do not stop using levetiracetam without first checking with your doctor. Stopping the medicine suddenly may cause your seizures to return or to occur more often. Your doctor may want you to gradually reduce the amount you are taking before stopping it completely.
Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using levetiracetam. Levetiracetam may affect the results of certain medical tests.

Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of fluocinonide topical in the pediatric population. However, because of this medicine's toxicity, it should be used with caution. Children may absorb large amounts through the skin, which can cause serious side effects. If your child is using this medicine, follow your doctor's instructions very carefully. For Vanos® cream, safety and efficacy have not been established in children younger than 12 years of age.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of Vanos® cream in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related medical problems, which may require caution in patients receiving Vanos® cream.
No information is available on the relationship of age to the effects of fluocinonide topical in geriatric patients.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. Tell your healthcare professional if you are taking any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicine.
Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur.

",,,"Contraindications


Known hypersensitivity to linezolid or any ingredient in the formulation.


Current or recent (within the last 2 weeks) treatment with drugs that inhibit MAO A or B (e.g., isocarboxazid, phenelzine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.)


Warnings/Precautions
Hematologic Effects
Myelosuppression (anemia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia) reported.
Toxicity studies in adult and juvenile dogs and rats indicate myelosuppression (bone marrow hypocellularity/decreased hematopoiesis; decreased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver; decreased levels of circulating erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) and lymphoid depletion in thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen.
Monitor CBCs weekly during linezolid treatment, especially in those receiving the drug for >2 weeks and in those who have preexisting myelosuppression, are receiving concomitant drugs associated with bone marrow suppression, or have a chronic infection that was or is being treated with concomitant anti-infective therapy.
Consider discontinuing linezolid if myelosuppression develops or worsens. Hematologic parameters generally have increased toward pretreatment values following discontinuance of the drug.
Peripheral and Optic Neuropathy
Peripheral and optic neuropathies reported in adults and children receiving linezolid, principally in those receiving the drug for >28 days.  Optic neuropathy progressing to loss of vision reported when linezolid used for >28 days.  Blurred vision reported in some patients who received the drug for <28 days.
If patient experiences symptoms of visual impairment (e.g., changes in visual acuity or color vision, blurred vision, visual field defect), promptly perform an ophthalmic evaluation. Monitor visual function in all patients receiving linezolid for extended periods of time (i.e., ≥3 months). In addition, monitor visual function in all patients reporting a new visual symptom, regardless of length of linezolid treatment.
If peripheral or optic neuropathy occurs, weigh potential benefits versus risks of continued linezolid treatment.
Serotonin Syndrome
Serotonin syndrome (including some fatalities) reported in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with serotonergic drugs.        Signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome include mental changes (confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems), muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering, shaking, diarrhea, loss of coordination, and/or fever.
Most reported cases occurred in patients receiving linezolid concomitantly with SSRIs or SNRIs. FDA has not concluded whether concomitant use of linezolid with other drugs with lesser degrees of serotonergic activity (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, MAO inhibitors) is associated with a risk comparable to that reported with SSRIs or SNRIs.
Unless considered clinically appropriate and patients can be carefully monitored for signs and/or symptoms of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome-like (NMS-like) reactions, do not use linezolid in patients with carcinoid syndrome or in patients receiving SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin 5-HT1 receptor agonists (triptans), meperidine, bupropion, or buspirone. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.)
In cases when patient is already receiving a serotonergic antidepressant or buspirone and urgent treatment with linezolid is required (e.g., life-threatening infection caused by MRSA or vancomycin-resistant E. faecium) and alternatives to linezolid are not available and potential benefits of the drug outweigh risks of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions, stop the serotonergic antidepressant promptly and administer linezolid.  Monitor for manifestations of serotonin syndrome or NMS-like reactions (e.g., hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability, mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) for 2 weeks (5 weeks if fluoxetine was taken) or until 24 hours after last linezolid dose, whichever comes first.  Also monitor for symptoms associated with discontinuance of the antidepressant.
Mortality
In an investigational study in seriously ill patients with intravascular catheter-related infections†, mortality was higher in patients receiving linezolid than in patients receiving a comparator anti-infective (vancomycin, oxacillin, dicloxacillin); patients also could receive concomitant therapy for gram-negative infection.  There was no difference in mortality between linezolid and comparator regimens in patients with only gram-positive bacteria identified in the baseline culture; mortality was higher in linezolid-treated patients with gram-negative bacterial infections, mixed gram-positive and gram-negative infections, or no pathogen identified at baseline.  Causality not established.
Not approved by FDA for treatment of catheter-related bacteremia or catheter-site infections;  not approved for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections. 
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibition
Linezolid is a weak, nonselective, reversible inhibitor of MAO,   and potentially may interact with MAO inhibitors and adrenergic and serotonergic agents. (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.)
Significant pressor response reported when tyramine doses >100 mg were used in adults receiving linezolid. Instruct patients to avoid large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content during linezolid treatment.  Foods high in tyramine content include those that may have undergone protein changes by aging, fermentation, pickling, or smoking to improve flavor (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented or air-dried meat, sauerkraut, soy sauce, tap beer, red wine). Consider that tyramine content of any protein-rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated.
Risk of Hypertension
Unless monitored for potential increases in BP, do not use linezolid in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, pheochromocytoma, or thyrotoxicosis or in patients receiving direct- or indirect-acting sympathomimetic agents (e.g., pseudoephedrine), vasopressor agents (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), or dopaminergic agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine). (See Specific Drugs under Interactions.)
Lactic Acidosis
Lactic acidosis, characterized by recurrent nausea and vomiting, reported.  Patients who develop recurrent nausea and vomiting, unexplained acidosis, or a low bicarbonate concentration while receiving linezolid should undergo immediate medical evaluation. 
Seizures
Seizures reported; history of seizures or risk factors for seizures noted in some cases.
Hypoglycemia
Symptomatic hypoglycemia reported in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving linezolid concomitantly with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.
Although causal relationship between linezolid and hypoglycemia not established, caution patients with diabetes mellitus about potential for hypoglycemia during linezolid treatment.
If hypoglycemia occurs, dosage reduction of insulin or oral antidiabetic agents or discontinuance of linezolid, insulin, or oral antidiabetic agents may be necessary.
Sensitivity Reactions
Anaphylaxis, angioedema, and bullous skin disorders, such as those described as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, reported.
Tooth Discoloration
Superficial tooth discoloration and tongue discoloration reported. In cases with known outcome, tooth discoloration was removable with professional dental cleaning (manual descaling).
Phenylketonuria
Oral suspension contains aspartame, which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 20 mg of phenylalanine per 5 mL of suspension. 
Linezolid tablets do not contain aspartame  and should be used in individuals with phenylketonuria (i.e., homozygous genetic deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase) and other individuals who must restrict their intake of phenylalanine.
Superinfection/Clostridium difficile-associated Diarrhea and Colitis (CDAD)
Possible emergence and overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Monitor carefully; institute appropriate therapy if superinfection occurs.
Treatment with anti-infectives alters normal colon flora and may permit overgrowth of Clostridium difficile.   
C. difficile infection (CDI) andC. difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD; also known as antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis or pseudomembranous colitis) reported with nearly all anti-infectives, including linezolid, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.    C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD;  hypertoxin-producing strains of C. difficile are associated with increased morbidity and mortality since they may be refractory to anti-infectives and colectomy may be required.
Consider CDAD if diarrhea develops during or after therapy and manage accordingly.    Obtain careful medical history since CDAD may occur as late as ≥2 months or longer after anti-infective therapy is discontinued.
If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, discontinue anti-infectives not directed against C. difficile whenever possible.  Initiate appropriate supportive therapy (e.g., fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation), anti-infective therapy directed against C. difficile (e.g., metronidazole, vancomycin), and surgical evaluation as clinically indicated.   
Selection and Use of Anti-infectives
Linezolid is indicated only for treatment of certain infections caused by certain gram-positive bacteria. The drug has no clinical activity against gram-negative bacteria and is not indicated for treatment of infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.
It is imperative that an anti-infective active against gram-negative bacteria be used concomitantly if documented or presumptive pathogens also include gram-negative bacteria. (See Uses.)
Safety and efficacy of linezolid given for >28 days not evaluated in controlled clinical trials. (See Dosage under Dosage and Administration.)
To reduce development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of linezolid and other antibacterials, use only for treatment of infections proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.
When selecting or modifying anti-infective therapy, use results of culture and in vitro susceptibility testing. In the absence of such data, consider local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns when selecting anti-infectives for empiric therapy.

Use with caution in nursing women.
Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP, nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections in pediatric patients are supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients, and additional data from a comparator-controlled study of gram-positive infections in neonates and children through 11 years of age. Safety and efficacy for treatment of CAP in pediatric patients also is supported by evidence from an uncontrolled study in patients 8 months through 12 years of age.
Safety and efficacy for treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in pediatric patients established in a comparator-controlled study in pediatric patients 5–17 years of age.
In children with a suboptimal response to linezolid, especially those with infections caused by pathogens with linezolid MICs of 4 mcg/mL, consider inadequate systemic exposure, site and severity of infection, and underlying medical conditions.
Manufacturer states not recommended for empiric treatment of CNS infections in pediatric patients. (See Distribution under Pharmacokinetics.)
Geriatric Use
Pharmacokinetic, safety, and efficacy profiles similar to those in younger adults.  Possibility of greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out.
Hepatic Impairment
Mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B): Pharmacokinetics not altered.
Severe hepatic impairment: Pharmacokinetics not evaluated.
Renal Impairment
Although clinical importance not determined, the 2 principal metabolites of linezolid may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function; amount of accumulation increases with severity of renal impairment. Weigh potential benefits against potential risks of accumulation of linezolid metabolites. (See Renal Impairment under Dosage and Administration.)
Common Adverse Effects
GI effects (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, localized or generalized abdominal pain, loose stools), headache, rash, dizziness, anemia, thrombocytopenia.
","Minimally metabolized; possibly by CYP isoenzymes.
Does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4. Does not induce CYP isoenzymes.
Drugs Affecting or Metabolized by Hepatic Microsomal Enzymes
Potent inducers of hepatic enzymes: Possible reduced linezolid concentrations.
Specific Drugs
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Rapidly and extensively absorbed after oral administration. Absolute oral bioavailability is approximately 100%. 
Peak plasma concentrations attained within 1–2 hours following oral administration.
Food
Time to peak concentrations is delayed and peak concentration decreased when administered with high-fat meal; extent of absorption not affected. Not considered clinically important.
Distribution
Extent
Readily distributed into well-perfused tissues.
Adults with CNS infections: IV administration of linezolid (600 mg twice daily) resulted in steady-state mean peak CSF concentrations 36–58% of mean peak plasma concentrations;  time to peak CSF concentrations was approximately 3–4 hours after a dose.
Pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts: Therapeutic concentrations not consistently achieved or maintained in CSF after single or multiple doses.
Linezolid and its metabolites distributed into milk in rats; not known whether distributed into human milk.
Plasma Protein Binding
Approximately 31%.
Elimination
Metabolism
Principally metabolized by oxidation of the morpholine ring to 2 inactive metabolites (metabolites A and B). Minimally metabolized; possibly mediated by CYP enzyme system.
Elimination Route
Approximately 65% of a dose eliminated via nonrenal clearance. At steady state, approximately 30% of dose eliminated in urine as unchanged drug, 10% as metabolite A, and 40% as metabolite B. Mean renal clearance is 40 mL/minute, suggesting net tubular reabsorption.
Almost no linezolid is found in feces as unchanged drug; approximately 3 and 6% of a dose is eliminated in feces as metabolites A and B, respectively.
Linezolid and its metabolites removed by hemodialysis. Approximately 30% of linezolid dose removed by 3-hour hemodialysis session started 3 hours after the dose.
Not known whether linezolid or its metabolites removed by peritoneal dialysis.  
Half-life
Adults: Mean elimination half-life is 4.3–6.4 hours. 
Neonates: Mean elimination half-life is 5.6 hours in preterm neonates <1 week of age, 3 hours in full-term neonates <1 week of age, and 1.5 hours in neonates 1 week to 28 days of age.
Infants and children: Mean elimination half-life is 1.8 hours in infants >28 days through 2 months of age and 2.9 hours in children 3 months through 11 years of age.
Adolescents 12 through 17 years of age: Mean elimination half-life is 4.1 hours.
Special Populations
Geriatric adults ≥65 years of age: Pharmacokinetics similar to younger adults. 
Pediatric patients: Clearance varies with age and there is wide intraindividual variability. Excluding neonates <7 days of age, clearance is most rapid in the youngest age groups (i.e., those 7 days to 11 years of age); as children age, clearance of linezolid decreases and clearance in adolescents is similar to that observed in adults.
Pharmacokinetics of linezolid not affected by mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A or B); not evaluated in severe hepatic impairment.
Pharmacokinetics of linezolid not affected by renal impairment, but the 2 principal metabolites accumulate; amount of accumulation increases with increasing severity of renal impairment.

Advise patients that antibacterials (including linezolid) should only be used to treat bacterial infections and not used to treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).


Importance of completing full course of therapy, even if feeling better after a few days.


Advise patients that skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may decrease effectiveness and increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable with linezolid or other antibacterials in the future.


Advise patients that linezolid may be taken orally without regard to meals.


If using the oral suspension, importance of not shaking the bottle vigorously and gently inverting the bottle 3–5 times to resuspend the drug prior to administration of each dose.


Advise patients of the potential risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly if linezolid is used concomitantly with MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, or other serotonergic drugs. Importance of immediately contacting clinician if signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome develop (e.g., confusion, hyperactivity, memory problems, muscle twitching, excessive sweating, shivering, shaking, diarrhea, loss of coordination, fever). Importance of not discontinuing serotonergic drugs without first consulting clinician.


Advise patients, particularly those with diabetes mellitus, that hypoglycemic reactions (diaphoresis and tremulousness) and low blood glucose concentrations may occur during linezolid treatment. Importance of contacting a clinician to obtain proper treatment if such reactions occur.


Importance of avoiding large quantities of foods or beverages with high tyramine content during linezolid treatment; this includes foods or beverages that have been aged, fermented, pickled, or smoked to improve flavor (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented or air-dried meats, sauerkraut, soy sauce, tap beer, red wine). Consider that tyramine content of any protein-rich food may be increased if stored for long periods or improperly refrigerated.


Advise individuals with phenylketonuria that the oral suspension contains aspartame, which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 20 mg of phenylalanine per 5 mL of suspension.


Importance of notifying clinician of any history of hypertension or seizures.


Importance of notifying clinician if any change in vision occurs.


Advise patients that diarrhea is a common problem caused by anti-infectives and usually ends when the drug is discontinued. Importance of contacting a clinician if watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) occur during or as late as 2 months or longer after the last dose.


Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy including prescription drugs (e.g., antidepressants) and OTC drugs (e.g., pseudoephedrine), as well as any concomitant illnesses.


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.


Importance of advising patients of other important precautionary information. (See Cautions.)

lopressor,"Metoprolol is used alone or together with other medicines to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. A lower blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks.
Metoprolol is also used to treat severe chest pain (angina) and lowers the risk of repeated heart attacks. It is given to people who have already had a heart attack. In addition, metoprolol is used to treat patients with heart failure.
This medicine is a beta-blocker. It works by affecting the response to nerve impulses in certain parts of the body, like the heart. As a result, the heart beats slower and decreases the blood pressure. When the blood pressure is lowered, the amount of blood and oxygen is increased to the heart.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of metoprolol tablets in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of metoprolol extended-release tablets and extended-release capsules in children younger than 6 years of age. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of metoprolol in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving metoprolol.
Breastfeeding
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur.

lupron,"Leuprolide injection is a synthetic (man-made) hormone that is similar to a natural hormone that is produced in the brain. It is used to treat a number of medical problems including:

Anemia caused by bleeding from uterine leiomyomas (fibroid tumors in the uterus), or
Cancer of the prostate that is advanced or late-stage, or
Central precocious puberty, a condition which causes early puberty in boys (before 9 years of age) and girls (before 8 years of age), or
Pain due to endometriosis.

Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg is used in combination with norethindrone acetate to initially relieve and manage the reoccurrence of the painful symptoms of endometriosis. It is also used together with iron to treat bleeding in women with anemia caused by uterine leiomyomas before a surgical procedure. It is given in women who need 3 months of hormonal suppression.
When given regularly to men, leuprolide decreases testosterone levels. Reducing the amount of testosterone in the body helps treat cancer of the prostate.
When given regularly to women, leuprolide decreases estrogen levels. Reducing the amount of estrogen in the body helps treat endometriosis. Leuprolide will also shrink tumors in the uterus, which decreases vaginal bleeding and helps prevent anemia.
When given regularly to boys and girls who have early puberty, leuprolide slows the development of the genital area for both sexes. Leuprolide will also slow breast development in girls. This medicine will delay puberty only as long as the child continues to receive it.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of leuprolide pediatric injection in children. However, use is not recommended in children younger than 2 years of age. Leuprolide pediatric injection will stop having an effect for central precocious puberty soon after the child stops using it, and puberty will advance normally.
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of Eligard®, Lupron®, Lupron Depot®, Lupron Depot®-3 month, Lupron Depot®-4 month, Lupron Depot®-6 month, Lupron Depot® 11.25 mg, or Viadur® in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.

mometasone,"Asthma
Mometasone: Maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy.  
Mometasone in fixed combination with formoterol (mometasone/formoterol): Treatment of asthma in patients not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist.
Mometasone alone or in fixed combination with formoterol: Not indicated for treatment of acute bronchospasm (i.e., as rescue therapy for treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm).  
",,"General


Adjust dosage carefully according to individual requirements and response.  


After a satisfactory response is obtained, decrease dosage gradually to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response.   Achieve the lowest effective dosage, particularly in children, since inhaled corticosteroids have the potential to affect growth.   (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.)


Base initial and maximum dosages in adults and children ≥12 years of age on previous asthma therapy.  


Conversion to Orally Inhaled Therapy in Patients Receiving Systemic Corticosteroids


When switching from systemic corticosteroids to orally inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone, asthma should be reasonably stable before initiating oral inhalation treatment. 


Initially, administer oral inhalation concurrently with the maintenance dosage of the systemic corticosteroid.  After at least 1 week, gradually withdraw the systemic corticosteroid. 


Decrements of the systemic corticosteroid usually should not exceed 2.5 mg daily of prednisone (or its equivalent) each week in patients receiving an orally inhaled corticosteroid. Once oral corticosteroids are discontinued and symptoms of asthma have been controlled, titrate dosage of the orally inhaled drug to the lowest effective level. 


Death has occurred in some individuals in whom systemic corticosteroids were withdrawn too rapidly.   (See Withdrawal of Systemic Corticosteroids under Cautions.)


Administration
Oral Inhalation
Mometasone (Asmanex Twisthaler): Administer by oral inhalation as an oral inhalation powder using the Twisthaler breath-actuated dry powder inhalation device. 
Mometasone (Asmanex HFA): Administer by oral inhalation as an oral inhalation suspension using metered-dose aerosol inhaler with hydrofluoroalkane (HFA; non-chlorofluorocarbon) propellant.
Mometasone/formoterol fixed combination (Dulera): Administer by oral inhalation as an oral inhalation suspension using metered-dose aerosol inhaler with HFA propellant. 
Following each mometasone or mometasone/formoterol dose, rinse the mouth thoroughly with water without swallowing.  
Oral Inhalation Powder
Administer as a single oral inhalation once or twice daily. When administered once daily, use at the same time each day, preferably in the evening for optimal efficacy.
Removal of the cap from the Twisthaler device (by twisting in a counterclockwise direction) releases a single dose of drug from the drug storage unit into the inhalation channel, making the dose available for administration via oral inhalation through the mouthpiece. The dose counter will decrease by 1 each time the cap is removed. Remove the Twisthaler cap with the inhaler in an upright position. Before inhaling the dose, exhale as completely as possible, but not into the Twisthaler device. Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler between the lips and inhale quickly and deeply through the inhaler. Do not cover the ventilation holes on either side of the inhaler while inhaling the dose. Remove the inhaler from the mouth, hold breath for about 10 seconds, then exhale slowly.
Wipe mouthpiece dry with a dry cloth or tissue. Close and reload the Twisthaler device for the next dose by twisting the cap in a clockwise direction until a click is heard. Do not wash the inhaler; store in a dry place. Discard the inhaler when every inhalation is used (when the dose indicator reads “00”) or 45 days after removal from its foil overwrap pouch, whichever comes first.
Oral Inhalation Aerosol
Administer as 2 oral inhalations twice daily (morning and evening).
Use only with actuator supplied with the product.
Mometasone (Asmanex HFA): Test spray 4 times into the air (away from the face) before first use or if not used for >5 days; shake well before each test spray and each inhalation. Remove the cap from the mouthpiece of the actuator before use. Do not wash inhaler in water; clean the mouthpiece using a dry wipe every 7 days.
Mometasone/formoterol fixed combination (Dulera): Test spray 4 times into the air (away from the face) before first use or if not used for >5 days; shake well before each test spray and each inhalation. Clean inhaler every 7 days by wiping mouthpiece with a dry cloth; do not wash inhaler in water.
Dosage
Available as mometasone furoate; dosage expressed in terms of the salt. 
Also available as fixed combination containing mometasone furoate and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (mometasone/formoterol); dosage of mometasone component expressed in terms of the salt and dosage of formoterol component expressed in terms of hydrated salt.
Strength and dosage of mometasone furoate administered as an oral inhalation powder (Asmanex Twisthaler) is expressed as the nominal (labeled) dose contained in the Twisthaler device. Amount of drug delivered to the lungs depends on several factors, such as the patient’s inspiratory flow. Each actuation of the Twisthaler device contains 110 or 220 mcg of mometasone furoate oral inhalation powder and delivers approximately 100 or 200 mcg of mometasone furoate from the mouthpiece, depending on preparation used.
Each actuation of the oral aerosol inhaler containing mometasone furoate (Asmanex HFA) delivers 115 or 225 mcg of mometasone furoate from the valve and 100 or 200 mcg of mometasone furoate from the actuator, depending on preparation used. Strength and dosage of the preparation expressed in terms of drug delivered from mouthpiece of the actuator. Actual amount of drug delivered to the lungs depends on several factors, such as coordination between actuation of the device and patient’s inspiratory flow. Asmanex HFA aerosol inhaler delivers 120 actuations per 13-g canister.
Each actuation of the oral aerosol inhaler containing the mometasone/formoterol fixed combination (Dulera) delivers 115 or 225 mcg of mometasone furoate and 5.5 mcg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate from the valve and delivers 100 or 200 mcg of mometasone furoate and 5 mcg of formoterol fumarate dihydrate from the actuator, depending on preparation used. Strength and dosage of the preparation expressed in terms of drug delivered from mouthpiece of the actuator. Actual amount of drug delivered to the lungs depends on several factors, such as coordination between actuation of the device and patient’s inspiratory flow. Dulera aerosol inhaler delivers 60 or 120 metered sprays per 8.8- or 13-g canister, respectively.

Mometasone: Known hypersensitivity to the drug or any ingredient (e.g., milk proteins) in the formulation. 


Mometasone/formoterol fixed combination: Hypersensitivity to mometasone, formoterol, or any ingredient in the formulation.


Warnings/Precautions
Use of Fixed Combinations
When mometasone used in fixed combination with formoterol, consider cautions, precautions, contraindications, and interactions associated with formoterol. (See Risk of Serious Asthma-related Events under Cautions.)
Acute Exacerbations of Asthma
Do not use mometasone alone or in fixed combination with formoterol as a bronchodilator; not indicated for emergency use (e.g., status asthmaticus) or relief of acute bronchospasm.   Treat acute asthma symptoms with a short-acting β2-agonist bronchodilator.   If inadequate control of symptoms persists with supplemental β2-agonist bronchodilator therapy, promptly reevaluate asthma therapy.   Such reevaluation may include dosage adjustment of inhaled corticosteroids or initiation of systemic corticosteroids.  
Localized Candidal Infections
Candidal infections of the mouth and pharynx reported.   If such infections occur, initiate appropriate local or systemic antifungal treatment while still continuing orally inhaled mometasone therapy.   May require interruption of mometasone therapy in some patients.   Rinse mouth with water (without swallowing) after oral inhalation to help reduce the risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis.  
Immunosuppressed Patients.
Increased susceptibility to infections in patients who are taking immunosuppressant drugs compared with healthy individuals.   Certain infections (e.g., chickenpox, measles) can have more serious or even fatal outcomes in such patients, particularly in children.  
Take particular care to avoid exposure in susceptible patients.   If exposure to chickenpox or measles occurs in susceptible patients, consider administering varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or, immune globulin IM (IGIM), respectively.   Consider treatment with an antiviral agent if chickenpox develops.  
Use with caution, if at all, in patients with clinical or asymptomatic Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections of the respiratory tract; untreated fungal, bacterial, parasitic or viral infections; or ocular herpes simplex.  
Withdrawal of Systemic Corticosteroids
Possible life-threatening adrenal insufficiency in patients being switched from systemic corticosteroids to orally inhaled corticosteroids, including mometasone.  
Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy gradually and monitor for objective signs of adrenal insufficiency (e.g., fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea, vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal of systemic therapy.   Carefully monitor lung function (FEV1 or peak expiratory flow rate [PEFR]), adjunctive β2-adrenergic agonist use, and asthma symptoms.   In most patients, several months are required for total recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) function following withdrawal of systemic corticosteroid therapy.   Patients maintained on ≥20 mg of prednisone (or its equivalent) daily may be most susceptible to such adverse events, particularly during the later part of the transfer.  
Monitor patients for corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., joint pain, muscular pain, lassitude, depression).  
Monitor patients for acute adrenal insufficiency during exposure to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with acute electrolyte loss.  
Possible unmasking of conditions previously controlled by systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).  
Systemic Corticosteroid Effects
Although only minimal systemic absorption occurs following oral inhalation, administration of higher than recommended dosages of orally inhaled mometasone over prolonged periods of time or in particularly sensitive individuals may result in manifestations of hypercorticism and suppression of HPA function.   If such changes occur, reduce mometasone dosage slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroid dosage and management of asthma symptoms.  
Take particular care in monitoring patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response.  
Musculoskeletal Effects
Long-term use may affect normal bone metabolism, resulting in a loss of bone mineral density (BMD).  
Monitor patients with major risk factors for decreased BMD (e.g., family history of osteoporosis, prolonged immobilization, chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass [e.g., anticonvulsants, corticosteroids]) and treat with established standards of care.  
Ophthalmic Effects
Long-term use may cause glaucoma, increased IOP, and cataracts.   Consider referral to an ophthalmologist in patients who develop ophthalmic symptoms or in those receiving long-term therapy with mometasone.  
Bronchospasm
Possible acute, life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing.   If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, immediately treat patient with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator and discontinue mometasone.  
Sensitivity Reactions
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis, rash, pruritus, angioedema, urticaria, flushing, allergic dermatitis, bronchospasm) reported.   Discontinue mometasone if such reactions occur.
Oral inhalation powder contains small amounts of lactose with trace amounts of milk proteins. Anaphylactic reactions in patients with milk protein allergy reported; do not use in patients with known milk protein allergy. (See Contraindications under Cautions.)
Risk of Serious Asthma-related Events
Monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, such as formoterol, a component of mometasone/formoterol, increases the risk of asthma-related death.  Data from clinical trials suggest that monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists also increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents.
Based on review of 4 clinical trials (3 in adults and adolescents and 1 in children), FDA concluded there is no clinically important increased risk of serious asthma-related events (i.e., asthma-related hospitalization, intubation, death) associated with use of fixed combinations containing long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids compared with inhaled corticosteroids alone for the treatment of asthma.   These studies also showed that combination therapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids reduced the incidence of asthma exacerbations compared with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone.  
Use mometasone/formoterol fixed combination only in patients with asthma not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy, (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category C.
No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.   Use during pregnancy only if potential benefits justify potential risks to fetus.
Increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (e.g., preeclampsia, premature birth, low birth weight, small neonates for gestational age) in women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma.   Closely monitor pregnant women with asthma and adjust medication as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control. 
Effects of mometasone/formoterol fixed combination during labor and delivery not known. Because of potential for β-agonist interference with uterine contractility, restrict use of mometasone/formoterol during labor to those patients in whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.
Monitor infants born to women receiving substantial oral corticosteroid dosages during pregnancy for signs of hypoadrenalism.
Lactation
Not known whether mometasone is distributed into milk; however, other corticosteroids are distributed into milk.   Data not available on effects of the drug on the breast-fed child or milk production.  Consider the benefits of breast-feeding and importance of mometasone to the woman along with any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from the drug or underlying maternal condition.  Caution advised if mometasone oral inhalation powder used in nursing women.
Manufacturer of mometasone/formoterol fixed combination states that a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the woman.
Pediatric Use
Mometasone oral inhalation powder: Safety and efficacy not established in children <4 years of age.
Mometasone oral inhalation aerosol: Safety and efficacy not established in children <12 years of age.
Mometasone/formoterol oral inhalation aerosol: Safety and efficacy not established in children <12 years of age. 
With prolonged use, may slow growth rate in children and adolescents.   Monitor routinely (e.g., via stadiometry) the growth and development of pediatric patients receiving corticosteroid therapy.   Weigh benefits of corticosteroid therapy versus possibility of growth suppression and the risks associated with alternative therapies.   Use the lowest possible dosage that effectively controls asthma.  
Geriatric Use
No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults, but increased sensitivity cannot be ruled out.  
Common Adverse Effects
Mometasone oral inhalation aerosol: Nasopharyngitis, headache, sinusitis, bronchitis, influenza.
Mometasone oral inhalation powder: Headache, allergic rhinitis, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, sinusitis, oral candidiasis, dysmenorrhea, musculoskeletal pain, back pain, dyspepsia.
Mometasone/formoterol oral inhalation aerosol: Nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, headache.
","The following information addresses potential interactions with mometasone.   No formal drug interactions studies performed to date using mometasone/formoterol. When the fixed combination used, also consider interactions associated with formoterol.
Mometasone metabolized by CYP3A4 isoenzyme.  
Drugs Affecting Hepatic Microsomal Enzymes
Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4: Potential pharmacokinetic interaction (increased plasma mometasone concentrations).  
Specific Drugs
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Systemic bioavailability <1% following oral inhalation of a single 440-mcg dose of mometasone. 
Onset
≥1–2 weeks of continuous oral inhalation therapy may be required to achieve optimum symptomatic relief.  
Duration
When corticosteroids are discontinued, asthma control remains stable for several days or longer.
Distribution
Extent
Not known whether mometasone is distributed into milk;   however, other corticosteroids are distributed into milk.  
Does not accumulate in RBCs.  
Plasma Protein Binding
98–99%.  
Elimination
Metabolism
Extensively metabolized in the liver, principally by CYP3A4 isoenzyme.   
Elimination Route
Excreted principally in feces and to a lesser extent in urine.   
Half-life
Following IV administration, approximately 5 hours.  
Special Populations
In patients with hepatic impairment, plasma concentrations of mometasone may be increased.

When used in fixed combination with formoterol, importance of informing patients of important cautionary information about formoterol.


Importance of instructing patients to read manufacturer's patient instructions prior to initiation of therapy.  


Importance of adequate understanding of proper storage, preparation, and inhalation techniques, including use of the oral inhalation delivery systems.  


Importance of pediatric patients receiving oral inhalation therapy under adult supervision.  


Importance of informing clinician of any history of hypersensitivity reactions to mometasone or other ingredients in the formulations   or of known allergy to milk proteins.


Importance of rinsing the mouth with water without swallowing after oral inhalation.   


Importance of advising patients that mometasone furoate oral inhalation must be used at regular intervals to be therapeutically effective.  


Importance of advising patient that if a dose of mometasone alone or in fixed combination with formoterol is missed, take the next dose at the regularly scheduled time; do not double the dose.  


Importance of adherence to prescribed dosage regimen; do not increase the frequency of administration without consulting a clinician.  


Importance of advising patients that at least 1–2 weeks of continuous therapy may be required for optimum effects to be achieved.   Importance of contacting a clinician if asthma symptoms do not improve in such a time frame.  


Importance of advising patients that orally inhaled mometasone should not be used as a bronchodilator and that the drug is not indicated for emergency use (e.g., relief of acute bronchospasm).  


Importance of availability and use of a short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist for relief of acute asthma symptoms.   


Importance of contacting a clinician immediately if asthmatic attacks that are not controlled by bronchodilator therapy occur. 


Importance of gradual withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids during transfer to orally inhaled mometasone and of monitoring by a clinician during such transfer of therapy.  (See Conversion to Orally Inhaled Therapy in Patients Receiving Systemic Corticosteroids under Dosage and Administration.)


Importance of advising patients being transferred from systemic corticosteroid to mometasone oral inhalation therapy to carry special identification (e.g., card, bracelet) indicating the need for supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or severe exacerbation of asthma.  Importance of advising patients to immediately resume therapy with large doses of systemic corticosteroids and contact their clinician for further instructions during stressful periods (e.g., stress, severe asthmatic attack, surgery, trauma, infection).  


Importance of informing patients that corticosteroids may decrease bone mineral density.   (See Musculoskeletal Effects under Cautions.)


Risk of localized candidal infections of mouth and pharynx.  


Risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (e.g., hypercorticism, potentially life-threatening adrenal suppression).   Importance of informing a clinician of fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or fainting.   (See Systemic Corticosteroid Effects under Cautions.)


Risk of reduction in growth velocity in children and adolescents with orally inhaled corticosteroids.   (See Pediatric Use under Cautions.)


Risk for development of cataracts or glaucoma with long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., mometasone).   Importance of reporting any vision changes to a clinician.   (See Ophthalmic Effects under Cautions.)


Importance of immunosuppressed patients avoiding exposure to chickenpox or measles, and, if exposed, of immediately consulting a clinician.   (See Immunosuppressed Patients under Cautions.)


Importance of advising immunosuppressed patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, parasitic, or viral infections, or ocular herpes simplex.   Importance of immunosuppressed patients informing clinician of a history of infections.  


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.  


Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs as well as any concomitant illnesses (e.g., infections).  


Importance of informing patients of other important precautionary information.   (See Cautions.)

nicotine,"Smoking Cessation
Used for nicotine replacement therapy as a temporary adjunct in the cessation of cigarette smoking either unsupervised (self-medication)     or in conjunction with a behavior modification program under clinician supervision.                        
Nicotine replacement therapy considered one of several first-line therapies by USPHS for treatment of tobacco dependence. For additional information, consult the most current USPHS clinical practice guideline available at [Web]
Nicotine replacement therapy provides alternative sources of nicotine that help reduce the withdrawal symptoms associated with nicotine dependence.           Chewing the resin complex-containing gum may act as a substitute oral activity in behavior modification.
Electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been used to aid smoking cessation attempts; however, these products are not approved by FDA for this use and evidence is limited regarding their efficacy and safety.       The role of ENDS relative to conventional nicotine replacement therapies for smoking cessation remains to be established.   
Ulcerative Colitis
Transdermal nicotine has been used in the management of ulcerative colitis†.       
",,"General


To increase smoking cessation rate,     use as part of a comprehensive program of multiple treatment strategies, including behavioral modification.                    


Individualize duration of therapy based on patient response and degree of nicotine dependence.     


Stop smoking prior to initiating nicotine replacement therapy;    self-medication not recommended in patients who continue to smoke, chew tobacco, or use snuff or other nicotine-containing preparations.  


Discontinue therapy in patients who continue to smoke 4 weeks after initiating treatment;    may use nicotine replacement therapy again in subsequent attempts to quit smoking.    


Administration
Administer nicotine percutaneously by topical application of a transdermal system. 
Administer nicotine transmucosally by oral inhalation using a special nicotine oral inhaler or intranasally using a metered-dose spray pump.   
Administer nicotine polacrilex intrabuccally (transmucosally) as a lozenge or chewing gum. 
May be administered as a single nicotine preparation (i.e., intrabuccally, intranasally, percutaneously, or by oral inhalation); however, if single therapy does not enable patients to quit smoking, use of transdermal nicotine may be combined with another form of nicotine replacement (i.e., either buccal nicotine polacrilex or nicotine nasal spray).
Buccal Administration
Chewing Gum
Self-administer one piece of gum in response to the urge to smoke.
Chew gum very slowly until a distinctive peppery taste of nicotine, minty, cinnamon, or orange taste of the gum, or a slight tingling in the mouth is perceived (typically about 15 chews); stop chewing gum and park between cheek and gum; once tingling is almost gone (about 1 minute), repeat chewing procedure. Continue for about 30 minutes or until taste dissipates. Do not swallow gum.
Do not eat or drink anything other than water for 15 minutes before and during chewing of gum. 
Do not chew multiple pieces of gum simultaneously; do not chew too rapidly or chew pieces in succession. May cause excessive release of nicotine and result in adverse effects (e.g., lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, irritation of the throat and mouth, hiccups, indigestion).
Chew at least 9 pieces of gum daily to improve chances of quitting.
Do not attempt to discontinue nicotine polacrilex gum therapy until craving is satisfied by 1 or 2 pieces of the gum daily, but do not continue therapy for >6 months, unless otherwise instructed by clinician.  
4-mg strength gum recommended in highly dependent smokers because of evidence of increased efficacy.
Lozenges
Suck on lozenge until dissolved; do not swallow, bite, or chew.   Allow to slowly dissolve in the mouth over 20–30 minutes, periodically moving the lozenge (e.g., with the tongue) from one side of the mouth to the other; minimize swallowing.  A warm or tingling sensation may be perceived.
Do not eat or drink anything other than water for 15 minutes before and during sucking on the lozenge.  
Use at least 9 lozenges daily for the first 6 weeks to improve chances of quitting.
Using >1 lozenge simultaneously or using one lozenge after another in uninterrupted sequence may result in adverse effects (e.g., hiccups, heartburn, nausea).
Self-administer lozenge in response to nicotine craving; decrease frequency of administration over time. 
Topical Administration
Administer percutaneously by topical application of a transdermal system once daily. 
Apply at the same time each day, usually after awakening.       
Expose the adhesive surface of the system by peeling and discarding the protective liner just prior to application and apply system immediately to avoid loss of nicotine through volatilization.    
Apply transdermal system to a clean, dry, hairless area of intact skin   on the trunk or upper outer arm        by firmly pressing the system with the adhesive side touching the skin.   Press system firmly in place with heel of hand for about 10 seconds, ensuring good contact, particularly around the edges.    Do not apply to sites that are oily, damaged, or irritated;   if necessary, hair may be clipped, but do not shave area.
System may be worn for 16 or 24 hours.  If cravings begin upon awakening, wear patch for 24 hours.  If vivid dreams or sleep disruptions occur, wear patch for 16 hours; remove at bedtime and apply new patch upon awakening.   
If system inadvertently comes off during the period of use, apply a new system;       continue current application schedule or change so that the next system is applied 24 hours later.
Rotate application sites to minimize potential skin irritation; allow ≥1 week before reusing a given site.    (See Dermatologic Effects under Cautions.)
Avoid unnecessary contact with transdermal systems.    Avoid touching eyes after handling; wash hands with water alone as soap may enhance percutaneous absorption.    
Intranasal Administration
Administer intranasally using a metered-dose spray pump.
Prime spray pump prior to initial use by spraying into a tissue until a fine spray is seen (6–8 times); discard tissue.
If spray pump is not used for 24 hours, reprime pump by spraying into a tissue 1–2 times.
Clear nasal passages prior to administration.
Tilt the head back slightly;  insert tip of bottle into one nostril as far as is comfortable. Breathe through the mouth and spray once into nostril; do not sniff, swallow, or inhale through the nose while administering. Repeat this procedure for the other nostril.
If nose runs, sniff gently to keep nasal spray in nose; wait 2–3 minutes before blowing nose.
Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and mouth; if contact occurs, rinse with plain water immediately. If intranasal bottle breaks, wear protective gloves, wipe with paper towels, and wash surfaces thoroughly.
Oral Inhalation
Administer transmucosally as an inhaled vapor by oral inhalation using a special nicotine oral inhaler that mimics smoking cigarettes.    
Hold the oral inhaler with two hands; separate the top and bottom pieces by pushing and turning the pieces until markings line up. Insert one nicotine cartridge and push the cartridge until it pops into place. Line up markings on the top and bottom pieces of the inhaler and push pieces together tightly; lock inhaler by turning pieces until markings do not line up.
Place the mouthpiece of the inhaler between lips and puff on the inhaler using rapid shallow sucking (“buccal mode”);  alternatively, inhale slowly and deeply into back of throat (“pulmonary mode”).  Nicotine is vaporized and absorbed in mouth and throat. (See Absorption under Pharmacokinetics.) Shallow puffing method generally is preferred.   Deep inhalation technique requires considerable effort and does not result in substantially increased drug delivery or other benefits.
Individualize orally inhaled dosage to the level of nicotine replacement required; optimum results generally achieved by frequent continuous puffing of the inhaler over 20 minutes.
Nicotine is used up from cartridge after about four 5-minute sessions or one 20-minute session of active puffing.
When cartridge is empty, remove top of mouthpiece; discard empty cartridge away from children and pets. Store with mouthpiece in locked position and cartridges in plastic case. Clean reusable mouthpiece regularly with soap and water.
Use inhaler at temperatures >60°F; cold temperatures decrease the amount of nicotine inhaled.
Also administered transmucosally as an inhaled vapor by oral inhalation via electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes and vape pens; however, safety and efficacy in smoking cessation not evaluated by FDA.  
Dosage
Chewing gum and lozenges available as nicotine polacrilex; dosage expressed in terms of nicotine. 
Nicotine oral inhaler cartridges labeled as containing 10 mg of nicotine deliver ≤4 mg total with repeated inhalation.   The amount of nicotine released depends on the volume and temperature of the air passing through the inhaler.     An intensive inhalation regimen (80 deep inhalations over 20 minutes) releases approximately 4 mg of nicotine.
Metered nasal spray delivers 0.5 mg of the nicotine per metered spray and about 200 sprays (i.e., 100 doses) per 100-mg container.

Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
Nicotine Toxicity
Risk of nicotine toxicity (e.g., nausea, hypersalivation, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, perspiration, headache, dizziness, hearing and visual disturbances, mental confusion, weakness)      and addiction.     Sustained use of nicotine preparations is not recommended.       Weigh risk of nicotine replacement against hazard of continued smoking concurrent with nicotine replacement therapy and likelihood of smoking cessation without nicotine replacement.    
Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if symptoms suggestive of overdosage (nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, weakness, and rapid heartbeat) occur.
Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity
Animal studies indicate fetal harm; pregnant women should attempt smoking cessation with educational and behavioral interventions before considering nicotine therapy.             
Use during pregnancy only if the increased likelihood of smoking cessation justifies potential risk to the fetus and patient of nicotine replacement and possible continued smoking.            If used during pregnancy or if patient becomes pregnant, apprise of potential fetal hazard. 
General Precautions
Respiratory Effects
Possible exacerbation of bronchospasm. Use oral inhaler with caution in patients with bronchospastic disease; other dosage forms may be preferable.
Intranasal nicotine is not recommended in patients with severe reactive airway disease.
Nasopharyngeal Effects
Nicotine nasal spray may irritate nasal mucosa; use of nasal spray not recommended in patients with a history of chronic nasal disorders (e.g., allergy, rhinitis, polyps, sinusitis).
Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if severe sore throat occurs.
Cardiovascular Effects
Possible increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects;         however, causal relationship between nicotine replacement therapy and cardiac complications not established.        
Discontinue therapy if irregular heartbeat or palpitations occur.    
Use with caution and only after careful evaluation in patients with coronary heart disease (i.e., history of MI, angina pectoris), serious cardiac arrhythmias, or vasospastic diseases (e.g., Buerger's disease, Prinzmetal's variant angina, Raynaud's phenomena).         Benefit of nicotine replacement therapy must outweigh risks of continued cigarette smoking. 
Self-medication not recommended in patients in the immediate post-MI period, with serious arrhythmias, or with severe or worsening angina.  
Endocrine Effects
Possible hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance with prolonged nicotine replacement therapy. Use with caution in hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, or insulin-dependent diabetes.     
GI Effects
Possible delayed healing of peptic ulcer disease; use with caution.     
Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if persistent indigestion develops.
Use nicotine polacrilex gum with caution in patients with a history of esophagitis. 
Hypertension
Possible increased risk of malignant hypertension in patients with accelerated hypertension; use with caution in such patients.      
Possible perpetuation of hypertension; use with caution in patients with systemic hypertension.
Nicotine Dependence
Transference of dependence on nicotine may occur;            potential for abuse and dependence on nicotine nasal spray appears to be greater than that for other formulations of nicotine (i.e., nicotine polacrilex gum, transdermal nicotine systems) but less than that of cigarettes.    
To minimize withdrawal symptoms and the risk of dependence on nicotine, withdraw gradually or discontinue use of nicotine polacrilex gum or transdermal or intranasal nicotine after 2–3 months of therapy.      
Concern exists regarding possible risk of nicotine dependence transference from use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) such as e-cigarettes and vape pens in individuals, particularly adolescents, not previously dependent on nicotine but who subsequently transition to actual cigarette use.    
Phenylketonuria
Commit nicotine polacrilex lozenges contain aspartame (NutraSweet), which is metabolized in the GI tract to provide 3.4 mg of phenylalanine per lozenge.
Oral and Dental Effects
Risk of occlusal stress when nicotine polacrilex gum is chewed for long periods of time; may result in displaced dental restorations or loosening of dental inlays or fillings.  Gum may stick to dentures, dental caps, or partial bridges; if excessive sticking or damage to dental work occurs, discontinue gum and consult clinician.
Use nicotine polacrilex gum with caution in patients with a history of oral or pharyngeal inflammation, or dental conditions exacerbated by chewing gum. 
Discontinue nicotine polacrilex lozenges if mouth problems develop.
Dermatologic Effects
Possible skin reactions (e.g., urticaria, hives, rash) with transdermal systems.     Increased risk of such reactions in patients with some dermatologic conditions (e.g., psoriasis, atopic or eczematous dermatitis).   
If skin reaction occurs, discontinue transdermal system and contact clinician;     topical corticosteroids and/or oral antihistamines recommended.    
Risk of contact sensitization with transdermal systems; serious reaction may occur with re-exposure to smoking or other nicotine products.   
Nervous System Effects
Potential adverse nervous system effects (e.g., insomnia,    headache,             dizziness, lightheadedness).   
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category D.  (See Fetal/Neonatal Morbidity under Cautions.)
Lactation
Distributed into milk.          Use caution.         
Weigh risk of exposure to nicotine in drug versus risk of nicotine and other components of tobacco smoke from cigarettes.      
Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy not established.       
Use or ingestion of used or unused nicotine replacement systems by children may cause poisoning or be fatal; keep used and unused containers out of reach of children.     
Risk of choking if nicotine oral inhalers are swallowed; keep out of reach of children.
Geriatric Use
Insufficient experience in patients ≥65 years of age to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently than younger adults;     select dosage with caution because of age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, and/or cardiac function and potential for concomitant disease. 
Hepatic Impairment
Not studied in patients with hepatic impairment; use with caution.    
Renal Impairment
Not studied in patients with renal impairment; clearance may be decreased in patients with severe renal impairment.     
Common Adverse Effects
Buccal therapy (gum): Indigestion;      nausea;       hiccups;      traumatic injury to oral mucosa and/or teeth;  irritation and/or tingling of the tongue, mouth, and throat;          oral mucosal ulceration;        jaw-muscle ache;      eructation;   gum sticking to teeth; unpleasant taste;   dizziness;  lightheadedness;  headache;  insomnia.
Buccal therapy (lozenges): Nausea, dyspepsia, flatulence, headache, upper respiratory tract infections.
Transdermal therapy: Application site reactions (i.e., pruritus, burning, or erythema),            diarrhea,  dyspepsia,  abdominal pain, dry mouth.   
Intranasal therapy: Runny nose,    throat irritation,     watery eyes,     sneezing,     cough.    
Oral inhalation therapy: Dyspepsia,  oropharyngeal irritation (e.g., coughing, mouth and throat irritation),   rhinitis, headache. 
","Cigarette smoke  and nicotine induce hepatic enzymes.  
Smoking Cessation
Cessation of smoking may alter the response to concomitant administration of various drugs in patients who previously smoked.   
Potential pharmacokinetic interaction (decreased metabolism and increased blood concentrations of certain drugs) with cessation of smoking.  
Consider the effect of smoking cessation in patients receiving nicotine replacement therapy when patient is receiving other drugs concomitantly.       
Sympathomimetic and Sympatholytic Drugs
Potential pharmacodynamic interaction (increased circulating plasma concentrations of cortisol and catecholamines); may require dosage adjustment of sympathomimetic (adrenergic) or sympatholytic (adrenergic blocking) drugs.
Possible altered absorption of transdermal nicotine from drugs producing cutaneous vasoconstriction (e.g., sympathomimetic agents) or vasodilation (e.g., antihypertensive agents).
Foods Affecting Salivary Acidity
Transient decrease of salivary pH may inhibit buccal absorption of nicotine from gum, lozenge, or oral inhaler. 
Specific Drugs and Foods
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Readily absorbed transmucosally following intrabuccal administration via chewing gum or sucking a lozenge,        and following oral inhalation      and intranasal administration; absorbed minimally from the GI tract.    
Readily absorbed percutaneously following topical application of a transdermal system.      
Gum: Averages 53–55%,  with peak concentrations achieved within 25–30 minutes.          
Lozenge: Approximately 25–27% more of an equivalent dose absorbed with lozenge than with gum.
Transdermal: Approximately 68–98%,       with peak concentrations achieved within 2–10 hours.          
Intranasal: Approximately 53%, with peak concentrations achieved within 4–15 minutes.          
Oral inhalation: Approximately 60%, mostly absorbed in the mouth,    with peak concentrations achieved within 15–30 minutes.          
Food
Acidic beverages may interfere with buccal absorption.  (See Specific Drugs and Foods under Interactions.)
Plasma Concentrations
Gum: Relatively constant blood nicotine concentrations attained following repeated administration are similar to those produced by smoking cigarettes.  
Transdermal: Plasma nicotine concentrations generally lower and fluctuate less than those produced by smoking cigarettes. 
Intranasal: Plasma nicotine concentrations similar to those produced by smoking cigarettes.    
Oral inhalation: Lower plasma nicotine concentrations compared with nasal spray. 
Special Populations
Common cold or rhinitis may decrease extent of absorption and peak plasma concentrations of intranasal nicotine.
Obesity decreases peak plasma concentration and AUC of transdermal systems.   
Distribution
Extent
Following IV administration in animals, rapidly distributes into most body tissues and fluids with highest concentrations in the cerebral cortex   and adrenal medulla, and lower concentrations in spleen, adrenal cortex, kidney, and pancreas.
Nicotine crosses the placenta   and is distributed into milk.   
Plasma Protein Binding
<5%. 
Elimination
Metabolism
Rapidly and extensively metabolized, principally in the liver, to >20 primarily inactive metabolites.       
Elimination Route
Excreted in urine mainly as metabolites (70–90%) and as unchanged drug (10–30%).   
Half-life
Biphasic; terminal half-life averages 2 hours (range: 1–4 hours).              
Following removal of a transdermal system, apparent half-life averages 3–6 hours.             
Special Populations
Hepatic impairment may reduce clearance.    
Severe renal failure may reduce clearance.

Importance of not smoking or using other tobacco products during nicotine replacement therapy.    


Advise patient of improved smoking cessation success with a comprehensive treatment approach (e.g., support groups, counseling, or specific behavior change techniques).


Importance of providing patient a copy of the manufacturer's patient information.   When used for self-medication, importance of reading patient instructions provided by the manufacturer.   


Importance of patient understanding the proper use (see Administration under Dosage and Administration) and disposal of nicotine preparations.       


Importance of avoiding unnecessary contact with transdermal systems.    Advise patients to discard transdermal system carefully; fold so adhesive side sticks to itself, place in empty protective pouch, and dispose of immediately.      Importance of washing hands with water alone; importance of not touching eyes prior to handwashing.      


Importance of keeping used and unused transdermal systems, intranasal containers, oral inhaler cartridges, gum, and lozenges out of the reach of children and pets.        Importance of contacting clinician or poison control immediately if a child or pet chews or swallows a nicotine product.       


Importance of calling clinician or poison control center if symptoms of nicotine overdose occur (e.g., bad headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, cold sweat, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, mental confusion, weakness, fainting). 


Advise patients of symptoms of nicotine withdrawal (e.g., craving, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, mood lability, anxiety, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, impaired concentration, increased appetite, minor somatic complaints [headache, myalgia, constipation, fatigue], weight gain).  


For transdermal therapy, importance of consulting clinician before initiating therapy if patient has a dermatologic condition or is allergic to adhesive tape.  (See Dermatologic Effects under Cautions.) Importance of discontinuing use and contacting clinician if severe or persistent skin reaction occurs at transdermal site (e.g., severe erythema, pruritus, edema).    


Advise patients receiving nicotine polacrilex gum that chewing gum too rapidly may result in lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, irritation of throat and mouth, hiccups, and indigestion.


Advise patients receiving intranasal therapy of likelihood of nasal irritation; may become less bothersome with continued use.


Advise patients receiving nicotine for oral inhalation of likelihood of mild irritation of the mouth or throat and cough; may become tolerant of these effects.


Importance of patients taking lozenges to stop use and contact clinician if mouth problems, persistent indigestion, severe sore throat, irregular heartbeat or palpitations occur. Patients receiving nicotine polacrilex gum should stop use and contact clinician if mouth, teeth, or jaw problems, or irregular heartbeat or palpitations occur.


Importance of informing patients with phenylketonuria that Commit nicotine polacrilex lozenges contain aspartame.


Importance of consulting clinician if patient feels the need for continued nicotine replacement therapy at the end of regimen.    


Risk of dependence to nicotine in oral inhaler and nasal spray; importance of using inhaler and nasal spray only as long as directed by clinician. 


Importance of women informing their clinician if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed. 


Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs and dietary or herbal supplements, as well as any concomitant illnesses (e.g., chronic nasal problems, heart problems, high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, wheezing or asthma, overactive thyroid, diabetes requiring insulin, kidney or liver disease).

nitroglycerin,"Oral administration: Treatment or prevention of angina pectoris.
IV administration: Treatment of angina pectoris; acute decompensated heart failure; perioperative hypertension; induction of intraoperative hypotension.
Intra-anal administration (Rectiv ointment): Treatment of moderate to severe pain associated with chronic anal fissure.
",,"Note: Safety: Contraindicated in patients taking a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor for any indication or a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor (eg, riociguat) due to potentially severe hypotension. In general, if a patient who has taken a PDE5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction develops chest pain, delay nitrate therapy for ≥12 hours after taking avanafil, ≥24 hours after taking sildenafil or vardenafil, and ≥48 hours after taking tadalafil (Khera 2020; Stendra [avanafil] prescribing information). Consult drug interactions database for more information. In addition, avoid or use with caution in patients likely to develop hypotension or in whom hypotension could result in serious decompensation, including those with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis, or right ventricular infarction.
Acute decompensated heart failure (adjunctive therapy): 
Note: Consider in patients with volume overload and without symptomatic hypotension to help relieve dyspnea when response to IV diuretics is not adequate (ACCF/AHA [Yancy 2013]).
Continuous IV infusion: Initial: 5 to 10 mcg/minute; titrate as needed based on response and tolerability in increments of 5 to 10 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes up to a maximum of 200 mcg/minute. Lower doses produce venous dilation; however, arterial vasodilation may occur at high doses (Colucci 2020; Coons 2011; Mebazaa 2016). Tachyphylaxis develops within 24 to 48 hours of continuous administration. Hemodynamic control after this initial period can be maintained by transitioning to long-term oral therapy for heart failure (Colucci 2020).
Anal fissure (alternative agent):
Note: Administer topically as a local vasodilator in conjunction with supportive measures. A 0.2% ointment is not commercially available and must be prepared by a licensed compounding facility (Bleday 2020).
Peri-anal 0.2% or 0.4% ointment: After cleansing, apply around fissure(s) twice daily as directed for 4 weeks; if symptoms persist, continue treatment for another 4 weeks for a total duration of 8 weeks (Bacher 1997; Bleday 2020; Kennedy 1999; Lund 1997; Zuberi 2000).
Angina: 
Note: Recommended for acute angina. For prevention of recurrent angina, may use in combination with other anti-anginal therapy (eg, a beta-blocker) (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]).
Acute angina: 
Note: If pain is not relieved or worsens 3 to 5 minutes after 1 sublingual or translingual dose, seek immediate emergency medical attention (eg, call 911) (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]).
Sublingual powder (0.4 mg/packet): Initial: 1 or 2 packets at onset; repeat every 5 minutes if angina persists; may administer up to 3 packets in a 15-minute period (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]).
Sublingual tablet: Initial: 0.3 or 0.4 mg at onset; repeat every 5 minutes if angina persists; may administer up to 3 tablets in a 15-minute period (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]). For patients with refractory angina in the emergency department, up to 0.6 mg as a single dose may be considered (Reeder 2020).
Translingual 0.4 mg/spray: Initial: 1 or 2 sprays at onset; repeat every 5 minutes if angina persists; may administer up to 3 sprays in a 15-minute period (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]).
Continuous IV infusion:
Note: Consider IV therapy if angina is not relieved with other dosage forms. Avoid in patients with hypotension (eg, systolic BP <90 mm Hg or >30 mm Hg below baseline), marked bradycardia (eg, <50 beats per minute) or tachycardia (eg, >100 beats per minute), and/or suspected right ventricular infarction (ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]; Reeder 2020).
Initial: 5 to 10 mcg/minute with continuous cardiac monitoring; titrate as needed to relieve angina symptoms in increments of 5 mcg/minute every 5 to 10 minutes up to 20 mcg/minute; if angina persists at a dose of 20 mcg/minute, may increase by 10 to 20 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum dose of 400 mcg/minute (ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]; Reeder 2020; manufacturer's labeling). Tachyphylaxis develops within 24 to 48 hours of continuous nitrate administration.
Prevention of angina (adjunctive therapy):
Sublingual powder (0.4 mg/packet): Initial: 1 packet 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that may provoke angina.
Sublingual tablet: Initial: 0.3 or 0.4 mg 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that may provoke angina.
Translingual 0.4 mg/spray: Initial: 1 or 2 sprays 5 to 10 minutes prior to activities that may provoke angina.
Topical 2% ointment: Initial: Apply ½ inch upon rising and apply another ½ inch 6 hours later; if necessary, the dose may be doubled to 1 inch and subsequently doubled again to 2 inches if response is inadequate. Recommended maximum frequency of administration is 2 doses/day. Include a nitrate-free interval of ~10 to 12 hours each day to minimize the risk of tolerance.
Topical patch, transdermal: Initial: 0.2 to 0.4 mg/hour; increase dose as needed based on response and tolerability to a maximum of 0.8 mg/hour. Use a patch-on period of 12 to 14 hours/day and patch-off period (nitrate-free interval) of 10 to 12 hours/day to minimize the risk of tolerance. Alternatively, some experts recommend applying patch 30 to 45 minutes prior to activities that may provoke angina and removing patch after activity is complete (Chaudhary 2020).
ER capsule, oral: Initial: 2.5 to 6.5 mg 3 to 4 times daily; increase dose as needed based on response and tolerability to 26 mg 4 times daily. Include a nitrate-free interval of ~10 to 12 hours each day to minimize the risk of tolerance.
Extravasation management, sympathomimetic vasopressors (alternative agent) (off-label use):
Note: Nitroglycerin is an alternative if phentolamine is not available (Reynolds 2014).
Topical 2% ointment: Apply a 1-inch strip to site of ischemia; may repeat every 8 hours if needed (Reynolds 2014).
Hypertension, perioperative (alternative agent):
Note: For patients with chronic hypertension prior to surgery, restart oral therapies as soon as appropriate once hemodynamically stable. Address underlying causes (eg, pain, agitation, withdrawal, hypervolemia) prior to initiating antihypertensive therapy. Generally used for patients with hypervolemia who are not responsive to IV diuretic therapy, particularly if there is known or suspected ischemic heart disease or heart failure (Broussard 2020; London 2020).
Continuous IV infusion: Initial: 5 to 10 mcg/minute; increase based on BP response and tolerability in increments of 5 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes up to 20 mcg/minute; if no response at a dose of 20 mcg/minute, may increase by 10 to 20 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum dose of 200 mcg/minute. Lower doses primarily produce venous dilation; however, arterial vasodilation may occur at high doses (Broussard 2020; London 2020; manufacturer's labeling). Tachyphylaxis develops within 24 to 48 hours of continuous nitrate administration; if vasodilator requirements continue longer than 24 to 48 hours, transition to an alternative IV or oral vasodilator.
Hypertensive emergency (alternative agent) (off-label use):
Note: Limitations of use include variable efficacy compared to other agents (eg, inconsistent and transient BP response), possible reflex tachycardia, and possible reduced cardiac output. May be used as adjunctive therapy for patients with acute coronary syndrome or acute pulmonary edema. In general, goal of therapy is to reduce mean arterial pressure ~10% to 20% over the first hour, then 5% to 15% further over the next 23 hours, unless there is a compelling indication (eg, acute aortic dissection, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia) for more rapid BP and heart rate control (ACC/AHA [Whelton 2018]; Elliot 2020a; Marik 2011).
Continuous IV infusion: Initial: 5 mcg/minute; increase based on BP response and tolerability in increments of 5 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes up to 20 mcg/minute; if no response at a dose of 20 mcg/minute, may increase by 10 to 20 mcg/minute every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum dose of 200 mcg/minute. Lower doses produce venous dilation; however, arterial vasodilation may occur at high doses (ACC/AHA [Whelton 2018]; Elliot 2020b; Marik 2011). Tachyphylaxis develops within 24 to 48 hours of continuous nitrate administration; if vasodilator requirements continue longer than 24 to 48 hours, transition to an alternative IV or oral vasodilator.
Uterine relaxation (off-label use):
Note: May be used for obstetric emergencies (eg, uterine inversion, difficult fetal extraction due to uterine contraction, internal podalic version of a second twin) or to facilitate extraction of a trapped placenta, external cephalic version, or replacement of deeply prolapsed fetal membranes before placement of a cerclage (Hofmeyr 2020; Macones 2020; Weeks 2020). Dosing provided is an example and may vary based on indication.
IV: 50 mcg once; may repeat at 1-minute intervals as needed to sufficiently relax the uterus; maximum total dose: 250 mcg (Altabef 1992; Bayhi 1992; Chedraui 2003; Dayan 1996; Hofmeyr 2020; Macones 2020; Weeks 2020). If urgent uterine relaxation is required (eg, for fetal extraction), may use initial bolus of 100 to 200 mcg (Axemo 1998).
Dosage adjustment for concomitant therapy: Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.
","Concerns related to adverse effects:
• Headache: Dose-related headaches may occur, especially during initial dosing.
• Hypotension/bradycardia: Severe hypotension and shock may occur (even with small doses); paradoxical bradycardia and increased angina pectoris may accompany hypotension. Orthostatic hypotension may also occur; ethanol may accentuate this. Use with caution in volume depletion, preexisting hypotension, constrictive pericarditis, aortic or mitral stenosis, and extreme caution with inferior wall myocardial infarction (MI) and suspected right ventricular involvement. According to the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association, avoid use in patients with severe hypotension (SBP <90 mm Hg or >30 mm Hg below baseline), marked bradycardia or tachycardia, and right ventricular MI (ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]).
• Increased intracranial pressure: Nitroglycerin may precipitate or aggravate increased intracranial pressure and subsequently may worsen clinical outcomes in patients with neurologic injury (eg, intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury) (Rangel-Castilla 2008). Use is contraindicated in patients with increased intracranial pressure.
Disease-related concerns:
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Avoid use in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with outflow tract obstruction; nitrates may reduce preload, exacerbating obstruction and cause hypotension or syncope and/or worsening of heart failure (HF) (ACCF/AHA [Gersh 2011]).
Dosage form specific issues:
• Intra-anal ointment: Use caution when treating rectal anal fissures with nitroglycerin in patients with suspected or known significant cardiovascular disorders (eg, cardiomyopathies, HF, acute MI); intra-anal nitroglycerin administration may decrease systolic BP and decrease arterial vascular resistance.
• Long-acting agents: Avoid use of long-acting agents in acute MI or acute HF; cannot easily reverse effects if adverse events develop.
• Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).
• Transdermal patches: May contain conducting metal (eg, aluminum); remove patch prior to MRI.
Other warnings/precautions:
• Tolerance: May occur; cross tolerance to other nitro compounds have been reported. Appropriate dosing is needed to minimize tolerance development.

",,,,"Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide. In smooth muscle, nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase which increases guanosine 3’5’ monophosphate (cGMP) leading to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and smooth muscle relaxation. Produces a vasodilator effect on the peripheral veins and arteries with more prominent effects on the veins. Primarily reduces cardiac oxygen demand by decreasing preload (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure); may modestly reduce afterload; dilates coronary arteries and improves collateral flow to ischemic regions. For use in rectal fissures, intra-anal administration results in decreased sphincter tone and intra-anal pressure.

","Nitroglycerin crosses the placenta (David 2000).
Following a single maternal IV bolus dose of nitroglycerin at the time of incision prior to cesarean delivery, concentrations in the umbilical cord at birth were significantly lower than the maternal plasma (~1 minute after dosing); a wide variation in maternal plasma concentrations was observed (David 2000). Following application of a transdermal patch 0.4 mg/hour to pregnant women 20 to 36 weeks gestation, concentrations of nitroglycerin were low but detectable in the fetal serum ~1 to 4 hours after the patch was applied (fetal/maternal ratio: 0.23) (Bustard 2003).
IV nitroglycerin is recommended for use in pregnant females with preeclampsia when severe hypertension is associated with pulmonary edema (ESC [Regitz-Zagrosek 2018]). Based on its ability to produce smooth muscle relaxation, nitroglycerin may be used in obstetrical procedures when immediate relaxation of the uterus is needed, such as: uterine inversion following delivery (ACOG 183 2017), uterine relaxation during removal of retained placental tissue (ASA 2016), and management of breech delivery (Caponas 2001; Cluver 2015). Additional data may be necessary to further define the role of nitroglycerin for preterm labor (ACOG 171 2016; Duckitt 2014).

octreotide,"Octreotide is used for the long-term treatment of acromegaly (a growth hormone disorder) in patients who have been previously treated with octreotide or lanreotide. Octreotide works by reducing the amount of growth hormone that the body produces.
Octreotide is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For octreotide, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to octreotide or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of octreotide in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of octreotide in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more sensitive to the effects of octreotide than younger adults.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

Using octreotide with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines.

Lisinopril
Pegvisomant
Telotristat Ethyl

Interactions with food/tobacco/alcohol
Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco.
Other medical problems
The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of octreotide. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:

Diabetes or
Gallbladder disease or
Heart rhythm problems or
Thyroid problems or
Vitamin B12 deficiency—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.


End-stage kidney disease or
Liver disease (eg, cirrhosis, fatty liver disease)—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.

","Take octreotide only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
Take octreotide with a glass of water on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or at least 2 hours after a meal.
Swallow the delayed-release capsule whole. Do not crush, break, or chew it.
Dosing
The dose of octreotide will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of octreotide. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage form (delayed-release capsules):

For acromegaly:

Adults—At first, 20 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed and tolerated. However, the dose is usually not more than 80 mg per day.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of octreotide, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
Store in the refrigerator. Do not freeze.
You may keep the opened medicine at room temperature for up to 1 month. Throw away any unused medicine after 1 month.
","It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits to make sure that octreotide is working properly. Blood and urine tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
Octreotide may increase your risk of having gallstones (cholelithiasis), which may lead to swelling of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), bile ducts (cholangitis), or pancreas (pancreatitis). Check with your doctor right away if you have severe stomach pain with nausea and vomiting, indigestion, fever, chills, pains in the stomach or side, possibly radiating to the back, fast heartbeat, dark urine, bloating, or yellow eyes or skin.
Octreotide may cause your blood sugar levels to rise or fall. It may cover up signs of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), such as a change in your pulse rate. If you notice a change in the results of your blood sugar or urine sugar test, check with your doctor.
Octreotide may cause hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid gland). Check with your doctor right away if you have constipation, a depressed mood, dry skin and hair, cold skin, hair loss, hoarseness or husky voice, muscle cramps and stiffness, a slow heartbeat, weight gain, or unusual tiredness or weakness.
Contact your doctor right away if you have any changes to your heart rhythm. You might feel dizzy or faint, or you might have a fast, slow, pounding, or uneven heartbeat. Make sure your doctor knows if you had a heart rhythm problem, such as QT prolongation.
Octreotide may cause a serious allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, which can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Tell your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing or swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth after using octreotide.
Octreotide may improve fertility in some women, which could increase the risk for unplanned pregnancies. Talk to your doctor if you have any concerns.
Before you have any medical tests, tell the medical doctor in charge that you are using octreotide. The results of some tests may be affected by octreotide.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.

olopatadine,"Allergic Conjunctivitis
Used ophthalmically for symptomatic management of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.   
Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis
Used intranasally to provide symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis (e.g., hay fever).
Provides symptomatic relief of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and sneezing.
",,"Administration
Administer intranasally or topically to the eye.
Intranasal Administration
Administer intranasally twice daily, using a metered-dose nasal spray pump. Avoid spraying into the eyes.
Before initial use, prime the pump by releasing 5 sprays or until a fine mist appears. If nasal spray has not been used for >7 days, reprime the pump by releasing 2 sprays.
To actuate the pump, hold the bottle in one hand; with forefinger and middle finger on the shoulders of the pump unit and the thumb on the bottom of the bottle, press down on the shoulders of the pump to produce a fine mist.
Prior to administration, gently blow the nose to clear nasal passages. To administer, close one nostril; then, with head tipped down (chin toward chest), insert nasal applicator ¼ to ½ inch into the other nostril, hold bottle vertically upright, and aim spray tip toward the cheek side of the nose (away from the center of the nose). While gently breathing in through the nose, press firmly and quickly on the pump to release the spray. Breathe out through the mouth.
Do not tip head back or blow the nose immediately after dosing; tipping head back may produce a bitter taste in the mouth.
Repeat procedure for the other nostril. Alternate nostrils between each actuation.
Following administration, wipe nasal applicator with a clean tissue and replace the blue plastic cap.
If nasal applicator becomes clogged, do not attempt to clean by inserting a sharp object. Instead, remove nasal applicator by gently pulling it upward; once removed, wash (while pointing nasal applicator downward) by running warm tap water for about one minute. Shake the applicator to remove any water and place the applicator back on the bottle. Prime by spraying 2 times or until a fine mist appears.
Discard after 240 sprays.
Ophthalmic Administration

Nasal spray: Safety and efficacy not established in children <6 years of age. In clinical studies, incidence of epistaxis was higher in children 6–11 years of age (5.7%) compared with adolescents or adults (3.2%).
Geriatric Use
Ophthalmic solution: No substantial differences in safety and efficacy relative to younger adults. 
Nasal spray: Insufficient experience in patients ≥65 years of age to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently than younger adults. Other clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between geriatric and younger patients. Select dosage with caution because of age-related decreases in hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and potential for concomitant disease and drug therapy.
Common Adverse Effects
0.1% ophthalmic solution: Headache.  
0.2% ophthalmic solution: Symptoms similar to cold syndrome, pharyngitis.
Nasal spray: In adults and children ≥12 years of age, bitter taste, headache, epistaxis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, postnasal drip, cough, urinary tract infection. In children 6–11 years of age, epistaxis, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, bitter taste, pyrexia, rash.
","No formal drug interaction studies involving ophthalmic solution or nasal spray to date. 
Does not inhibit in vitro metabolism of substrates of CYP isoenzymes 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4.
Drugs Affecting or Metabolized by Hepatic Enzymes
Interactions with drugs that inhibit hepatic enzymes (e.g., CYP microsomal enzymes) unlikely because olopatadine is eliminated predominantly by renal excretion.
Potential for olopatadine and its metabolites to act as inducers of CYP isoenzymes not evaluated.
Protein-bound Drugs
Interactions with protein-bound drugs (e.g., possible displacement of other protein-bound drugs) unlikely because olopatadine is modestly protein bound.
Specific Drugs
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Ophthalmic solution: Limited systemic exposure following topical application to the eye; plasma concentrations usually are undetectable.  
Nasal solution: Peak plasma concentrations observed between 15 minutes and 2 hours following twice-daily intranasal administration. Average absolute bioavailability in healthy individuals is 57%.
Onset
Ophthalmic solution: Rapid onset;    symptomatic relief of itching generally occurs within 30 minutes.  
Nasal spray: Onset of action occurs after one day.

prochlorperazine,"Prochlorperazine is used to treat nervous, emotional, and mental conditions (eg, schizophrenia) and non-psychotic anxiety. It is also used to control severe nausea and vomiting. Prochlorperazine should not be used to treat behavioral problems in older adult patients who have dementia.
Prochlorperazine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For prochlorperazine, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to prochlorperazine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of prochlorperazine in children 2 years of age and older or weighing 9 kilograms (kg) (20 pounds (lbs)) and over. Use in children younger than 2 years of age or weighing under 9 kg (20 lbs) is not recommended.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of prochlorperazine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving prochlorperazine.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking prochlorperazine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive.

","Take prochlorperazine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered.
Dosing
The dose of prochlorperazine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of prochlorperazine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage forms (tablets):

For severe nausea and vomiting:

Adults and children 2 years of age and older and weighs more than 39 kilograms (kg) (85 pounds (lbs))—At first, 5 or 10 milligrams (mg) 3 or 4 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 40 mg per day.
Children 2 years of age and older and weighs 18 to 39 kg (40 to 85 lbs)—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 2.5 mg 3 times a day or 5 mg 2 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 15 mg per day.
Children 2 years of age and older and weighs 14 to 18 kg (30 to 39 lbs)—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 2.5 mg 2 or 3 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg per day.
Children 2 years of age and older and weighs 9 to 13 kg (20 to 29 lbs)—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. At first, 2.5 mg 1 or 2 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 7.5 mg per day.
Children younger than 2 years of age and weighs under 9 kg (20 lbs)—Use is not recommended.

Adults—At first, 5 milligrams (mg) 3 or 4 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 20 mg per day or longer than 12 weeks.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.


For schizophrenia:

Adults—5 to 10 milligrams (mg) 3 or 4 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 150 mg per day.
Children 6 to 12 years of age—At first, 2.5 mg 2 or 3 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg on the first day and 25 mg per day.
Children 2 to 5 years of age—At first, 2.5 mg 2 or 3 times a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose if needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg on the first day and 20 mg per day.
Children younger than 2 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of prochlorperazine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
","It is very important that your doctor should check the progress of you and your child at regular visits to make sure prochlorperazine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
Check with your doctor before using prochlorperazine with alcohol or other medicines that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The use of alcohol or other medicines that affect the CNS with risperidone may worsen the side effects of prochlorperazine, such as dizziness, poor concentration, drowsiness, unusual dreams, and trouble with sleeping. Some examples of medicines that affect the CNS are antihistamines or medicine for allergies or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, or sleeping medicines, medicine for depression, medicine for anxiety, prescription pain medicine or narcotics, medicine for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, medicine for seizures or barbiturates, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics, including some dental anesthetics.
Prochlorperazine may cause extrapyramidal symptoms. Check with your doctor right away if you have difficulty in speaking, drooling, loss of balance control, muscle trembling, jerking, or stiffness, restlessness, shuffling walk, stiffness of the limbs, twisting movements of the body, or uncontrolled movements, especially of the face, neck, and back.
Prochlorperazine may cause drowsiness, trouble with thinking, or trouble with controlling body movements, which may lead to falls, fractures or other injuries. Make sure you know how you react to prochlorperazine before you drive, use machines, or do other jobs that require you to be alert, well-coordinated, or able to think or see well.
Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. Getting up slowly may help. If this problem continues or gets worse, check with your doctor.
Prochlorperazine may make it more difficult for your body to cool itself down. Use care not to become overheated during exercise or hot weather since overheating may result in heat stroke. Also, use extra care not to become too cold while you are receiving risperidone injection. If you become too cold, you may feel drowsy, confused, or clumsy.
Make sure any doctor or dentist who treats you knows that you are using prochlorperazine. Prochlorperazine may affect the results of certain medical tests.
Prochlorperazine may cause tardive dyskinesia (a movement disorder). Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms while using prochlorperazine: lip smacking or puckering, puffing of the cheeks, rapid or worm-like movements of the tongue, uncontrolled chewing movements, or uncontrolled movements of the arms and legs.
Check with your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms while using prochlorperazine: convulsions (seizures), difficulty with breathing, a fast heartbeat, a high fever, high or low blood pressure, increased sweating, loss of bladder control, severe muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, or tiredness. These could be symptoms of a serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
Prochlorperazine can temporarily lower the number of white blood cells in your blood, increasing the chance of getting an infection. If you can, avoid people with infections. Check with your doctor immediately if you think you are getting an infection or if you get a fever or chills, cough or hoarseness, lower back or side pain, or painful or difficult urination.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.

Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them:
Incidence not known

Blurred vision
increased sensitivity of the skin to sunlight
irregular menstrual periods
itching, rash, redness, or discoloration of the skin

Theophylline belongs to a group of medicines known as bronchodilators. Bronchodilators are medicines that relax the muscles in the bronchial tubes (air passages) of the lungs. They relieve cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes.
This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered:
Allergies
Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated pediatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of theophylline in children. However, children younger than 1 year of age are more likely to have serious side effects, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving theophylline.
Geriatric
Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of theophylline in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of theophylline than younger adults, and are more likely to have kidney, liver, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving theophylline.
Breastfeeding
Studies in women suggest that this medication poses minimal risk to the infant when used during breastfeeding.
Interactions with medicines
Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

salmeterol,"Bronchospasm in Asthma
Salmeterol is used only concomitantly with long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) for treatment of asthma and prevention of bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease, including symptoms of nocturnal asthma.      
Monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., salmeterol) increases the risk of asthma-related death and may increase risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents. Use of salmeterol for treatment of asthma without concomitant use of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) is contraindicated.  (See Boxed Warning and also Asthma-related Death and Life-threatening Events under Cautions.)
Salmeterol is used only as additional therapy in patients with asthma currently receiving long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) but whose disease is inadequately controlled with such therapy.  
Salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone is used only in patients with asthma not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist.  
Once asthma control achieved and maintained, assess patient at regular intervals and step down therapy (e.g., discontinue salmeterol) if possible without loss of asthma control, and maintain patient on long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids).   
Salmeterol is not a substitute for corticosteroids; corticosteroid therapy should not be stopped or reduced in dosage when salmeterol is initiated.   (See Concomitant Anti-inflammatory Therapy under Cautions.)
Do not use salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone in patients with asthma adequately controlled on low or medium dosage of inhaled corticosteroids.  
In children and adolescents with asthma requiring addition of a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist to an inhaled corticosteroid, generally use a fixed-combination preparation containing both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist to ensure compliance with both drugs.
When separate administration of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist is clinically indicated, take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with both drugs. If compliance cannot be ensured, a fixed-combination preparation containing both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist is recommended.
Salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm.     (See Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes under Cautions.)
Exercise-induced Bronchospasm
Prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm.         
Use as a single agent for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm may be clinically indicated in patients without persistent asthma.
Use for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm may be clinically indicated in patients with persistent asthma; however, treatment of asthma should include long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids).
Bronchospasm in COPD
Long-term symptomatic treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with moderate to severe COPD (e.g., FEV1 less than 80% of predicted), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.        
Fixed combination with fluticasone as the inhalation powder (Advair Diskus) is used for maintenance treatment of airflow obstruction in COPD, including chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema; also used to reduce COPD exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbations.
Not indicated for relief of acute bronchospasm.   Use a short-acting inhaled β2-agonist intermittently (as needed) for acute symptoms of COPD.  (See Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes under Cautions.)
",,"General


When initiating salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone, discontinue regular use of short-acting, oral or inhaled β2-agonists;     use a short-acting, inhaled β2-agonist, not salmeterol (alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone), to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.    


Increasing use of short-acting, inhaled β2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma and failure to respond to a previously effective dosage is often a sign of asthma destabilization.         Extra/increased doses of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone are not recommended.         (See Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes under Cautions.) Consult clinician.  


Administration
Oral Inhalation
Administer by oral inhalation using a special oral inhaler (Diskus device) that delivers powdered salmeterol xinafoate alone (Serevent Diskus) or in fixed combination with fluticasone (Advair Diskus, AirDuo RespiClick) or using an inhalation aerosol containing salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone (Advair HFA) via an oral aerosol inhaler with hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant.   
Administer twice daily, approximately every 12 hours.    
Inhalation Powder
Hold the Diskus device in one hand, put the thumb of the other hand on the thumbgrip, and push the thumbgrip until the mouthpiece appears and snaps into position.   
To release powdered drug into the exit port, hold the inhaler in a level, horizontal position and depress the lever on the Diskus in a direction away from the patient.   
To avoid releasing and wasting additional doses of the drug, do not close the Diskus device, play with the lever, or advance the lever more than once.   A dose counter will advance each time the lever is depressed.   
Exhale completely, place the mouthpiece of the inhaler between the lips, and inhale deeply and rapidly through the inhaler with a steady, even breath.     Remove the inhaler from the mouth and hold the breath for 10 seconds before slowly exhaling.   
Do not exhale into the Diskus device.     
Do not use another dose from the Diskus device if the patient does not feel or taste the drug. 
Close the inhalation device and reset for the next dose by sliding the thumbgrip toward the patient as far as it will go.    Do not wash the inhaler.    Do not take inhaler apart.     
Discard the inhaler when every blister of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone has been used.     Alternatively, discard the inhaler 6 or 4 weeks after removal of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone, respectively, from its foil overwrap pouch.    
Consult manufacturer’s labeling for instructions on use of the AirDuo RespiClick oral inhaler.
Spacer devices not recommended with the Serevent or Advair Diskus inhaler.    Spacer devices or volume holding chambers not recommended with the AirDuo RespiClick inhaler.
Rinse the mouth without swallowing after inhalation of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate.   
Salmeterol/Fluticasone Inhalation Aerosol
Use the inhalation aerosol only with the actuator supplied with the product.
Shake the oral aerosol inhaler well for 5 seconds before each inhalation.  Test spray inhaler 4 times into the air (away from face) before initial use, and shake well for 5 seconds before each spray.  If inhaler not used for >4 weeks or if inhaler was dropped, test spray inhaler twice into the air (away from face) and shake well for 5 seconds before each spray. 
Remove cap covering mouthpiece of the aerosol inhaler. Look for foreign objects inside inhaler prior to use and check to see that canister is fully seated within actuator.
After exhaling as completely as possible, place mouthpiece of inhaler well into mouth and close lips firmly around it. Inhale deeply through mouth while actuating inhaler. Remove mouthpiece from mouth and hold breath for as long as possible (up to 10 seconds) and exhale slowly. It is recommended that 30 seconds elapse between inhalations. After inhalation, rinse mouth and spit out water. 
Clean the aerosol inhaler by wiping the opening where medicine sprays out of metal canister and mouthpiece with a dry cotton swab and dampened tissue, respectively, at least once a week after evening dose.  Allow actuator to air-dry overnight.
When dose counter on the aerosol inhaler reads “020,” recommend that the patient contact the pharmacy for a refill or consult clinician to determine need for a refill. Discard inhaler when the dose counter reads “000.” Never alter or remove dose counter from canister.
Dosage
Available as salmeterol xinafoate; dosage expressed in terms of salmeterol.

Special Populations
The following information addresses dosage of salmeterol in special populations. When salmeterol is used in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate, dosage requirements for fluticasone propionate should be considered.  
Hepatic Impairment
No specific dosage recommendations at this time. Monitor patients receiving salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone for increased drug exposure and systemic corticosteroid effects.    (See Hepatic Impairment under Cautions.)
Renal Impairment
No specific dosage recommendations at this time.   
Geriatric Patients
Dosage adjustments not recommended solely because of age in geriatric patients.  
",,,"Contraindications


Contraindicated for treatment of asthma without concomitant use of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) because of increased risk of asthma-related death and hospitalization. (See Boxed Warning and also Asthma-related Death and Life-threatening Events under Cautions.)


Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma or COPD when required.   


Alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone as inhalation powder: Patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins.  


Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
Use of Fixed Combinations
When used in fixed combination with fluticasone, consider cautions, precautions, contraindications, and interactions associated with fluticasone.
Asthma-related Death and Life-threatening Events
Increased risk of asthma-related death reported with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists (e.g., salmeterol) when used as monotherapy.     Data from clinical trials suggest that use of long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists as monotherapy also increases the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents.     (See Boxed Warning.)
Use of long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, including salmeterol, alone for treatment of asthma without concomitant use of long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) is contraindicated because of increased risk of asthma-related death and hospitalization. 
Use only as additional therapy in patients with asthma currently receiving long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) but whose disease is inadequately controlled with such therapy.    
Use in fixed combination with fluticasone only in patients with asthma not responding adequately to long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) or whose disease severity warrants initiation of treatment with both an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist.   (See Bronchospasm in Asthma under Uses.)
Large safety study (Salmeterol Multicenter Asthma Research Trial [SMART]) showed an increase in asthma-related deaths in patients receiving salmeterol.     Because of similar mechanisms of action among long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, these study findings are considered a class effect of these drugs.    
Based on review of 4 clinical trials (3 in adults and adolescents and 1 in children), FDA concluded that there is no clinically important increased risk of serious asthma-related events (i.e., asthma-related hospitalization, intubation, death) associated with use of fixed-combination therapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids compared with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone for the treatment of asthma.      These studies also showed that fixed-combination therapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists and inhaled corticosteroids was more effective in reducing the incidence of asthma exacerbations compared with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone.  
No adequate studies conducted to determine whether the rate of death is increased in patients with COPD receiving long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists.
Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes
Do not initiate therapy in patients during rapidly deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of asthma or COPD.    Salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone not studied in patients with acutely deteriorating asthma or COPD; initiation of salmeterol in this setting not appropriate.   
Serious acute respiratory events, including fatalities, reported when salmeterol initiated in patients with substantially worsening or acutely deteriorating asthma.    These adverse events mostly occurred in patients with severe asthma and in some patients with acutely deteriorating asthma.       However, such events also have occurred in patients with less severe asthma;     not possible from these reports to determine whether salmeterol contributed to these events.   
Increasing use of short-acting, inhaled β2-agonists is a marker of deteriorating asthma and failure to respond to a previously effective dosage of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone is often a sign of asthma destabilization.      Immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen is required in this situation, giving special consideration to the possible need for adding additional inhaled corticosteroids or initiating systemic corticosteroids.   
If asthma deteriorates in patients receiving salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone, immediate reevaluation with reassessment of the treatment regimen is required, giving special consideration to the possible need for increasing the strength of the fixed combination (higher strengths contain higher dosages of fluticasone only), adding additional inhaled corticosteroids, or initiating systemic corticosteroids.   Do not use extra/increased doses of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone in such situations.      
Do not use salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone for relief of acute symptoms (i.e., as rescue therapy for treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm).        Use a short-acting, inhaled β2-agonist, not salmeterol (alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone), to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath.   
When initiating salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone, discontinue regular use (e.g., 4 times daily) of short-acting, oral or inhaled β2-agonists.   
Concomitant Corticosteroid Therapy
Not a substitute for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. No data available demonstrating clinical anti-inflammatory effects of salmeterol such as that associated with corticosteroids. Possible worsening of asthma if corticosteroid dosage is altered or discontinued when salmeterol therapy is initiated.              
In patients receiving oral or inhaled corticosteroids for treatment of asthma, continue a suitable dosage of corticosteroid therapy to maintain clinical stability even if the patient feels better as a result of initiating salmeterol. Changes in corticosteroid dosage recommended only after clinical evaluation.
Particular care is needed during and after transfer of patients from systemic to inhaled corticosteroid therapy since death resulting from adrenal insufficiency has occurred during and after such transfer.   Do not use salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation aerosol to transfer patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy. Transfer of patients from systemic to inhaled corticosteroid therapy may unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions).  
Excessive Use and Use With Other Long-acting β2-Adrenergic Agonists
Do not use salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone more frequently or at higher dosages than recommended, or in conjunction with other preparations containing long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, since an overdose may result.   
Clinically important cardiovascular effects and fatalities associated with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs reported.        (See Cardiovascular Effects under Cautions.)
Patients receiving salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone should not use additional salmeterol or other long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists for any reason.   
Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms
Possible acute bronchospasm         or paradoxical bronchospasm reported; may be life-threatening and represent a hypersensitivity reaction.      (See Sensitivity Reactions under Cautions.)
If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, immediately treat patient with a short-acting, inhaled bronchodilator, discontinue salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone, and institute alternative therapy.      
Upper airway symptoms, including laryngeal spasm, irritation, or swelling (e.g., stridor, choking), and oropharyngeal irritation reported.
Cardiovascular Effects
Possible clinically important changes in pulse rate, BP, and/or cardiovascular symptoms; may require discontinuance of drug.  
ECG changes (e.g., flattening of T wave, prolongation of QTc interval, ST-segment depression) reported with β-agonists; clinical importance unknown. (See Coexisting Conditions under Cautions.)
Clinically important prolongation of the QTc interval, potentially causing ventricular arrhythmias, associated with administration of large dosages of oral or inhaled (about 12–20 times the recommended dose) of salmeterol or other β2-agonists.    Fatalities also reported in association with excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs. (See Excessive Use and Use With Other Long-acting β2-Adrenergic Agonists under Cautions.)
Angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia (rates up to 200 beats/minute), arrhythmias, and palpitations associated with excessive β-adrenergic stimulation.
Sensitivity Reactions
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions may occur; urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, and anaphylaxis reported.
Anaphylactic reactions reported very rarely in patients with severe milk protein allergy.   (See Contraindications under Cautions.)
Possible acute bronchospasm; frequently occurs with the first use of a new oral inhalation aerosol canister.         (See Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms under Cautions.)
General Precautions
CNS Effects
Possible CNS stimulation and adverse nervous system effects      including headache,       tremor,       nervousness,    dizziness/giddiness,   migraine, sleep disturbances, paresthesia, anxiety, or excitement. 
Seizures, nervousness, headache, tremor, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, and insomnia associated with excessive β-adrenergic stimulation.
Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders.   
Coexisting Conditions
Use with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, or hypertension; in patients with seizure disorders or thyrotoxicosis; and in those unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.    (See Cardiovascular Effects under Cautions and also CNS Effects under Cautions.)
Large IV doses of β2-adrenergic agonist albuterol (IV preparation not commercially available in the US) reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis.  
Hypokalemia and Hyperglycemia
Clinically important hypokalemia (usually transient and not requiring supplementation) may occur in some patients receiving β-adrenergic agonists;        may result in adverse cardiovascular effects (e.g., arrhythmias).    (See Cardiovascular Effects under Cautions.)
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category C.   No adequate and well-controlled studies of salmeterol or salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone in pregnant women.    Use during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies potential risk to the fetus. 
Increased risk of adverse perinatal events (e.g., preeclampsia, prematurity, low birth weight, small size for gestational age) in pregnant women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma.  Closely monitor pregnant women with asthma and adjust dosage of medications as needed to maintain optimal asthma control. 
Lactation
Salmeterol distributed into milk in rats;     not known whether salmeterol or fluticasone distributed into human milk.    Corticosteroids, other than fluticasone, distributed into human milk.   Effects of salmeterol or fluticasone on breast-fed infants or milk production also not known. 
Consider benefits of breast-feeding and the woman’s clinical need for salmeterol or fluticasone along with any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from the drugs or from the underlying maternal condition.  Use caution in nursing women. 
Pediatric Use
Safety and efficacy of salmeterol oral inhalation powder in adolescents ≥12 years of age established based on trials conducted in adults and adolescents. (See Bronchospasm in Asthma under Uses.) However, data suggest that monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists may increase the risk of asthma-related death and hospitalization in children and adolescents.    (See Boxed Warning and also Asthma-related Death and Life-threatening Events under Cautions.)
Safety and efficacy of salmeterol oral inhalation powder in children 4–11 years of age with asthma evaluated for periods up to 1 year. Current data suggest that such children may receive the same dosage as adults for the treatment of asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm.
Use of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation powder (Advair Diskus) in children 4–11 years of age with asthma is supported by data from one clinical trial and from extrapolation of efficacy data from older patients.  Safety and efficacy of such a combination in children <4 years of age not established.
Safety and efficacy of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation powder (AirDuo RespiClick) in children <12 years of age not established.
Safety and efficacy of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation aerosol (Advair HFA) in children <12 years of age not established. Data from a limited number of adolescents 12–17 years of age receiving salmeterol and fluticasone inhalation aerosol in fixed combination suggest that safety and efficacy are similar to that in adults.
Geriatric Use
Adverse effect profile of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation aerosol similar to that in younger adults.     
Insufficient experience with salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation powder (Advair Diskus) or inhalation aerosol (Advair HFA) in patients ≥65 years of age with asthma to determine whether geriatric patients respond differently than younger adults. 
No overall differences in safety or efficacy observed in geriatric patients receiving salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation powder (AirDuo RespiClick) compared with younger adults.
Increased incidence of serious adverse effects reported in patients ≥65 years of age with COPD receiving salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone inhalation powder (Advair Diskus) compared with younger adults; however, distribution of adverse effects similar in the two groups.
Use with caution in geriatric patients who have concomitant cardiovascular disease.    (See Cardiovascular Effects under Cautions.)
Hepatic Impairment
Plasma concentrations may be increased.    (See Special Populations under Pharmacokinetics.)
Transient elevation of hepatic enzymes reported in at least 1% of patients with asthma receiving salmeterol in clinical studies; however, did not lead to discontinuance from the studies.
Closely monitor patients with hepatic impairment.   
Common Adverse Effects
Patients with asthma (Serevent Diskus): Headache, influenza, nasal/sinus congestion, pharyngitis, rhinitis, tracheitis/bronchitis.
Patients with asthma (Advair Diskus): Upper respiratory tract infection/inflammation, pharyngitis, dysphonia, oral candidiasis, bronchitis, cough, headache, nausea, vomiting.

Potential pharmacokinetic (increased peak plasma concentrations and AUC of salmeterol) and pharmacologic interactions (increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects [e.g., QTc prolongation, palpitations, sinus tachycardia]) with concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.    Concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone not recommended.   
Specific Drugs
","Absorption
Bioavailability
Most of an orally inhaled drug actually is swallowed.     Bronchodilating action of orally inhaled sympathomimetic agents is believed to result from a local action of the portion of dose that reaches the bronchial tree.    
Low or undetectable systemic concentrations occur after inhalation of the recommended dosage and are not predictive of therapeutic effects.  
Onset
Time to onset of effective bronchodilation 60 minutes with salmeterol oral inhalation powder. Initial improvement in asthma control may occur within 30 minutes following oral inhalation of salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 week or longer after initiating treatment with salmeterol in fixed combination with fluticasone propionate. 
Maximum improvement in FEV1 generally occurs within 3 hours after administration of salmeterol oral inhalation powder.
Duration
Clinically important improvements are maintained for up to 12 hours in most patients receiving salmeterol oral inhalation powder. In the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in adolescents and adults, salmeterol oral inhalation powder provides protection for up to 9 hours and up to 12 hours in children 4–11 years of age.
Distribution
Extent
Crosses the blood-brain barrier in trace amounts. 
Not known whether the drug and/or its metabolites cross the placenta.
Distributed into milk in rats;  not known whether is distributed into human milk.
Plasma Protein Binding
94–98%. 
Elimination
Metabolism
Extensively metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation.   
Elimination Route
Eliminated in feces (60%) and urine (25%),      principally as metabolites.    
Half-life
About 5.5 hours (oral administration).  
Special Populations
Pharmacokinetics not studied in patients with hepatic impairment; however, increased plasma concentrations may occur since drug is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism. (See Hepatic Impairment under Cautions.)
","

When used in fixed combination with fluticasone, importance of informing patients of important cautionary information about fluticasone.  


Provide a copy of the manufacturer’s patient information (medication guide) for salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone with each prescription.       Importance of instructing patients to read the patient information, instructions for use, and/or medication guide prior to initiation of therapy and each time prescription is refilled.      


Importance of informing patients that monotherapy with long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists, including salmeterol, increases the risk of asthma-related death and may increase the risk of asthma-related hospitalization in children and adolescents.   
Importance of informing patients that salmeterol should not be the only therapy used for asthma treatment and must only be used as additional therapy when long-term asthma controller therapy (e.g., inhaled corticosteroids) does not adequately control symptoms.     Importance of informing patients that long-term asthma controller drugs must be continued when salmeterol is added to the treatment regimen.


Importance of children receiving therapy under adult supervision.


Importance of adequate understanding of proper storage, preparation, and inhalation techniques, including use of the inhalation delivery system.      


Importance of adherence to dosing schedules, including not altering the dose or frequency of use unless otherwise instructed by a clinician.      


Importance of advising patient that if a dose of salmeterol alone or in fixed combination with fluticasone is missed, the next dose should be taken at the regularly scheduled time; the dose should not be doubled.      


Importance of all patients being provided with and instructed in the use of a short-acting, inhaled β2-agonist (e.g., albuterol) as treatment for acute symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath).    


Importance of discontinuing regular use of short-acting, oral or inhaled β-agonists when initiating salmeterol and using short-acting, inhaled β-agonists to relieve acute symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath).   


Importance of contacting a clinician if asthma symptoms do not improve after 1 week of therapy.      


Importance of contacting a clinician immediately if patient experiences decreasing effectiveness of short-acting inhaled β2-agonists, need for more inhalations than usual of short-acting inhaled β2-agonists, or clinically important decrease in lung function (as outlined by clinician).   


Importance of patients who are receiving salmeterol-containing preparations not to use additional salmeterol or other long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists for any reason, including prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm or treatment of asthma or COPD.   


Importance of patients receiving corticosteroid therapy not to discontinue or alter dosage of corticosteroids without consulting a clinician, even if the patient feels better after initiating salmeterol.               Importance of informing patients that salmeterol should not be used as a substitute for oral or inhaled corticosteroids.


Importance of informing all patients with asthma that they must also continue regular maintenance treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid if they are receiving salmeterol.


Importance of patients not discontinuing therapy with salmeterol without medical supervision, since symptoms may recur after discontinuance.   


Importance of administering salmeterol inhalation powder at least 30 minutes prior to exercise for prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. Importance of not using additional doses of salmeterol for exercise-induced bronchospasm for 12 hours. Importance of not using additional salmeterol for exercise-induced bronchospasm while receiving therapy (twice daily) with salmeterol.


Importance of informing patients of adverse effects associated with β2-adrenergic agonists, such as palpitations, rapid heart rate, tremor, nervousness, or chest pain.     


Importance of informing a clinician of heart problems, high BP, seizures, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus, allergies to drugs or food (including milk proteins), or liver disorders prior to initiation of therapy.       


Importance of women informing clinicians if they are or plan to become pregnant or plan to breast-feed.       


Importance of informing clinicians of existing or contemplated concomitant therapy, including prescription and OTC drugs, vitamins, and herbal supplements.  


Importance of informing patients of other important precautionary information.    (See Cautions.)

scopolamine,"Motion Sickness
Prevention of motion-induced nausea and vomiting; considered most effective drug for this use.
Oral or IM administration usually reserved for patients exposed to short periods of intense motion or those highly susceptible to motion because these routes have short duration of effect and high incidence of adverse effects.
Transdermal administration is effective and has fewer adverse effects and increased duration compared with oral administration.
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting
Used transdermally for prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with recovery from anesthesia and surgery, but efficacy is equivocal.     
Surgery
Has been used preoperatively to inhibit salivation and excessive respiratory tract secretions, but use of general anesthetics (e.g., thiopental [no longer commercially available in the US], halothane) that do not stimulate secretions has reduced the need for this use.
Used preoperatively and in obstetrics in conjunction with analgesics or sedatives to produce tranquilization and amnesia; however, benzodiazepines may be preferred.
Has greater sedative, antisecretory (e.g., on respiratory secretions), and antiemetic effects than atropine; however, less effective than atropine in preventing intraoperative cholinergic effects (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, bradycardia).
Parkinsonian Syndrome
Has been used for symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian syndrome; however, antimuscarinincs generally have been replaced with dopaminergic drugs.
",,"Administration
Administer orally or by IM, direct IV, or sub-Q injection; also may administer percutaneously by topical application of a transdermal system (Transderm Scop).
When administered orally or IM for the prevention of motion sickness, generally administer 1 hour (range: 0.5–1.5 hours) before anticipated exposure to motion.
When used preoperatively, administer 30–60 minutes prior to the anticipated time of induction of anesthesia or at the same time other preanesthetic medications (e.g., opiates, sedatives) are administered, since scopolamine may cause behavioral changes in patients with pain or anxiety. (See CNS Effects under Cautions.)
Transdermal Administration
To prevent motion sickness, apply at least 4 hours (e.g., 4–24 hours) before anticipated exposure to motion.
To prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting, apply the evening before scheduled surgery. 
For use in cesarean section, apply 1 hour prior to surgery to minimize exposure of the fetus to the drug. 
Transdermal system should not be cut; only one transdermal system should be worn at any time.
Prior to administration, wipe area behind the ear with a clean, dry tissue to ensure it is dry.
To expose adhesive surface, peel and discard the clear plastic protective strip prior to administration; avoid finger contact with exposed adhesive layer to prevent contamination of the fingers with scopolamine.
Apply to dry, hairless area of skin behind the ear (postauricular) by firmly pressing the system with the adhesive side touching the skin.
If the system becomes dislodged during the intended period of use (up to 72 hours), remove it and replace with another system at a different postauricular site.
Generally not affected by limited exposure to water (e.g., during bathing or swimming).
Dosage
Tablets and injection: Available as scopolamine hydrobromide; dosage expressed in terms of the salt.

Warnings/Precautions
Warnings
CNS Effects
Possible adverse CNS effects, including CNS depression, manifested as drowsiness, euphoria, amnesia, fatigue, and dreamless sleep; disorientation; confusion; memory disturbances; and dizziness. Excitement, restlessness, hallucinations, or delirium may paradoxically occur, especially when scopolamine is used in the presence of severe pain. May result in impairment of performance of activities requiring mental alertness, physical coordination, or visual acuity (e.g., operating machinery, driving a motor vehicle). 
Use caution with underwater sports participation; warn patients about possible disorientation.
Use with caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy.
Ocular Effects
Possible increased intraocular pressure; monitor open-angle glaucoma therapy and adjust as necessary.
Idiosyncratic Reaction
Excessive susceptibility to the effects of scopolamine occurs rarely.  Toxic symptoms may occur with therapeutic doses. 
Most serious idiosyncratic reaction is acute toxic psychosis (e.g., confusion, agitation, rambling speech, hallucinations, paranoid behavior, delusions). Other manifestations may include marked CNS disturbances (e.g., complete disorientation, active delirium), somnolence, dilated pupils, accelerated pulse rate, and dryness of the mouth with a husky quality of the voice. 
Idiosyncratic reaction usually is reversed by physostigmine.
Withdrawal of Therapy
Possible drug withdrawal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, disturbances of equilibrium) following discontinuance of the transdermal system; usually do not appear until ≥24 hours after system removal. 
Withdrawal symptoms must be distingushed from overdosage signs and symptoms.  Mental confusion and dizziness may be observed with both withdrawal and acute toxicity.  Scopolamine withdrawal is suggested by bradycardia, headache, nausea, abdominal cramps, and sweating, while tachyarrhythmias, dry skin, and decreased bowel sounds occur with acute toxicity. 
General Precautions
Cardiovascular Effects
Possible tachycardia; use with caution in patients with tachyarrhythmias, CHF, CAD, or hyperthyroidism. 
GI Effects
Possible decreased GI motility. Use with caution if pyloric or intestinal obstruction is suspected.
Down Syndrome, Spastic Paralysis, and Brain Damage
Possible increased sensitivity to antimuscarinic effects (e.g., mydriasis, positive chronotropic effect).
Respiratory Effects
Systemically administered antimuscarinics may reduce bronchial secretions and may lead to inspissation and formation of bronchial plugs in debilitated patients with chronic pulmonary disease; use with caution in such patients.
GU Effects
Antimuscarinics decrease the tone and amplitude of contractions of the ureters and bladder. In patients with uninhibited or reflex neurogenic bladder, the amplitude and frequency of uninhibited contractions are reduced and bladder capacity is increased.
Possible urinary retention in patients with urinary obstruction. Use with caution in patients with partial obstructive uropathy. Use contraindicated in patients with obstructive uropathy (urinary bladder neck obstruction caused by prostatic hypertrophy).  
Seizure or Psychosis
Scopolamine may aggravate seizures or psychosis; use with caution in patients with a history of these conditions.
Specific Populations

sumatriptan,"Sumatriptan is used to treat acute migraine headaches in adults. It is not used to prevent migraine headaches and is not used for cluster headaches. Sumatriptan works in the brain to relieve the pain from migraine headaches. It belongs to the group of medicines called triptans.
Many people find that their headaches go away completely after they take sumatriptan. Other people find that their headaches are much less painful, and that they are able to go back to their normal activities even though their headaches are not completely gone. Sumatriptan often relieves other symptoms that occur together with a migraine headache, such as nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, and sensitivity to sound.
Sumatriptan is not an ordinary pain reliever. It will not relieve pain other than from migraine headaches. Sumatriptan is usually used for people whose headaches are not relieved by acetaminophen, aspirin, or other pain relievers.
Sumatriptan has caused serious side effects in some people, especially people who have heart or blood vessel disease. Be sure that you discuss with your doctor the risks of using sumatriptan as well as the benefits that it can have.
Sumatriptan is available only with your doctor's prescription.
","In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For sumatriptan, the following should be considered:

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully.
Pediatric
Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of sumatriptan in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established.
Geriatric
Use of sumatriptan is not recommended in elderly patients with kidney problems, heart or blood vessel disease, or high blood pressure, and should not be used by elderly patients with liver problems.
Breastfeeding
There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding.

","Do not use sumatriptan for a headache that is different from your usual migraines. Talk to your doctor about what to do for regular headaches.
To relieve your migraine as soon as possible, use sumatriptan as soon as the headache pain begins. Even if you get warning signals of a coming migraine (an aura), you should wait until the headache pain starts before using sumatriptan.
Ask your doctor ahead of time about any other medicine you might take if sumatriptan does not work. After you use the other medicine, check with your doctor as soon as possible. Headaches that are not relieved by sumatriptan are sometimes caused by conditions that need other treatment.
If you feel much better after a dose of sumatriptan, but your headache comes back or gets worse after a while, wait at least 2 hours before taking another dose. However, use sumatriptan only as directed by your doctor. Do not use more of it, and do not use it more often, than directed. Using too much sumatriptan may increase the chance of side effects. Do not take more than 200 mg in 24 hours.
Swallow the tablet whole with water or other liquids. Do not crush, break, or chew it.
You may take the tablet with or without food.
Sumatriptan comes with a patient information leaflet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.
Dosing
The dose of sumatriptan will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of sumatriptan. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For oral dosage form (tablets):

For migraine headaches:

Adults—25, 50, or 100 milligrams (mg) as a single dose. If you get some relief, or if the migraine comes back after being relieved, another dose may be taken 2 hours after the last dose. Do not take more than 200 mg in any 24-hour period.
Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor.





Storage
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.

Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
","It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to see if the medicine is working properly and to decide if you should continue to use it.
Check with your doctor if you used sumatriptan and it did not work. Also, check with your doctor if your migraine headaches are worse or if they are occurring more often since you started using sumatriptan.
You should not use sumatriptan if you have used an MAO inhibitor (MAOI) such as phenelzine (Nardil®) or tranylcypromine (Parnate®) within the past 2 weeks. Do not use sumatriptan if you have taken other triptan migraine medicines or ergot-type medicines within the past 24 hours. Some examples of triptan medicines are almotriptan (Axert®), eletriptan (Relpax®), naratriptan (Amerge®), or zolmitriptan (Zomig®). Some examples of ergot-type medicines are dihydroergotamine (D.H.E. 45®, Migranal®), ergotamine (Bellergal®, Cafergot®, Ergomar®, Wigraine®), or methysergide (Sansert®).
Sumatriptan may cause problems if you have heart disease. If your doctor thinks you might have a problem with sumatriptan, he or she may want you to take your first dose in the doctor’s office or clinic.
Sumatriptan may increase your risk of having abnormal heart rhythm, heart attack, angina, or stroke. This is more likely to occur if you or a family member already has heart disease, if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or if you smoke. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a heart problem, such as chest pain or discomfort, an uneven heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, pain or discomfort in the shoulders, arms, jaw, back, or neck, shortness of breath, or sweating. Call your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of a stroke, such as confusion, difficulty with speaking, double vision, headaches, an inability to move the arms, legs, or facial muscles, an inability to speak, or slow speech.
Check with your doctor right away if you have chest discomfort, jaw or neck tightness after using sumatriptan. Also, tell your doctor if you have sudden or severe abdominal or stomach pain or bloody diarrhea after using sumatriptan.
Check with your doctor immediately if blurred vision, difficulty in reading, or any other change in vision occurs during or after your treatment. Your eyes may need to be checked by an ophthalmologist (eye doctor).
Using sumatriptan alone or in combination with other migraine medicines for 10 or more days per month may lead to worsening of headache. You may keep a headache diary to record your headache frequency and drug use.
Make sure your doctor knows about all the other medicines you are using. Sumatriptan may cause a serious condition called serotonin syndrome when taken with some medicines. This especially includes medicines used to treat depression, such as citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, Celexa®, Cymbalta®, Effexor®, Lexapro®, Luvox®, Paxil®, Prozac®, Sarafem®, Symbyax®, or Zoloft®. Check with your doctor right away if you have agitation, confusion, diarrhea, excitement while talking that is not normal, fever, overactive reflexes, poor coordination, restlessness, shivering, sweating, trembling or shaking that you cannot control, or twitching. These could be symptoms of serotonin syndrome.
Sumatriptan may cause a serious type of allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical attention. The most serious signs of this reaction are very fast or irregular breathing, gasping for breath, wheezing, or fainting. Other signs may include changes in color of the skin of the face, very fast but irregular heartbeat or pulse, hive-like swellings on the skin, and puffiness or swellings of the eyelids or around the eyes. If these effects occur, get emergency help at once.
Drinking alcoholic beverages can make headaches worse or cause new headaches to occur. People who suffer from severe headaches should probably avoid alcoholic beverages, especially during a headache.
Some people feel dizzy or drowsy during or after a migraine, or using sumatriptan to relieve a migraine. As long as you are feeling dizzy or drowsy, do not drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert.
","Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention.
Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur:
Less common

Abdominal or stomach pain
anxiety

tiotropium,"COPD
Tiotropium alone (as oral inhalation powder or solution) or tiotropium/olodaterol fixed-combination therapy (as oral inhalation solution): Long-term maintenance treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with COPD, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.      
Tiotropium alone (as oral inhalation powder or solution): Reduction of COPD exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbations. 
A long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., orally inhaled salmeterol, formoterol, tiotropium) or an inhaled corticosteroid recommended for maintenance monotherapy in patients with moderate to severe COPD (e.g., FEV1 30 to <80% of predicted or, alternatively, <60% of predicted) who have persistent symptoms not relieved by as-needed therapy with a selective, short-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist.  Maintenance therapy with long-acting bronchodilators in such patients more effective and more convenient than regular therapy with short-acting bronchodilators.   Insufficient data to favor one maintenance monotherapy over another in patients with moderate to severe COPD.  In selected patients with inadequate response, may use a combination of several long-acting bronchodilators, such as tiotropium, and a long-acting β2-adrenergic agonist. 
In patients with severe to very severe COPD (e.g., FEV1 <30 to <50% of predicted), some clinicians recommend addition of an inhaled corticosteroid to one or more long-acting bronchodilators, given separately or in fixed combination;   however, benefits of combination therapy over monotherapy not consistently established.  If inadequate response or limiting adverse effects occur, may consider the addition or substitution of extended-release oral theophylline.  
Tiotropium alone (as oral inhalation powder or solution) or tiotropium/olodaterol fixed-combination therapy (as oral inhalation solution): Not indicated for initial treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or acute deterioration of COPD;   a drug with a more rapid onset of action (e.g., a short-acting β-adrenergic agonist) preferred.   
Asthma
Tiotropium alone (as oral inhalation solution): Long-term maintenance treatment of reversible bronchospasm associated with asthma.
Tiotropium oral inhalation solution: Not indicated for treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm.
Tiotropium/olodaterol fixed-combination therapy: Not indicated for treatment of asthma.
",,"Administration
Administer tiotropium powder by oral inhalation only using a special oral inhalation device (HandiHaler) that delivers powdered drug from capsules. Do not take capsules orally, as intended effects on the lungs will not be obtained. 
Administer tiotropium solution by oral inhalation only using a specific inhaler (Spiriva Respimat) that delivers a metered-dose spray.
Administer tiotropium/olodaterol in fixed combination by oral inhalation only using a specific inhaler (Stiolto Respimat) that delivers a metered-dose spray.
Spiriva Respimat and Stiolto Respimat inhalers deliver the drugs in an aqueous solution and mechanically produce a fine aerosol mist from the orally inhaled solutions. 
Administer tiotropium or tiotropium/olodaterol orally inhaled solutions once daily at the same time every day. 
In patients with asthma receiving orally inhaled tiotropium solution, may take 4–8 weeks to achieve maximum clinical benefit.
Oral Inhalation Powder
Open the dust cap by pressing the green piercing button. Pull the dust cap upward on the side opposite the hinge of the Handihaler device to expose the mouthpiece. Open the mouthpiece by pulling the mouthpiece ridge upward on the side opposite the hinge of the inhaler to expose the center chamber. Carefully open the blister card to expose only one capsule immediately before use. Capsule contains only a small amount of powder; do not open. Place capsule into the center chamber of the inhaler, and close the inhaler mouthpiece firmly until it snaps (clicks) into position, leaving the dust cap open (up). (See Stability.) Push down on the mouthpiece ridge to make sure that the mouthpiece is seated in the gray base of the inhaler. Hold the inhaler with the seated mouthpiece upward, depress the green button on the side of the inhaler completely (until the button is flush with the gray base of the inhaler), then release the button. The green button pierces the capsule and disperses the powdered drug upon inspiration.  Do not press the green piercing button more than once.  Do not shake the Handihaler device. Piercing the capsule may produce small gelatin pieces, which may pass into the mouth or throat; gelatin pieces not expected to cause any harm.
Exhale completely; do not exhale into the HandiHaler device. Hold the inhaler by the gray base; take care not to block the air intake vents near the mouthpiece ridge. With the head kept level, place the mouthpiece of the inhaler between the lips (inhaler is in a horizontal position) and inhale deeply and slowly through the inhaler with a rate sufficient to hear or feel the loaded capsule vibrate (rattle).  Pressure from inhalation will disperse the drug from center chamber into air stream created by the patient’s inhalation. Continue breathing until the lungs are full. Remove the inhaler from the mouth and hold the breath for a few seconds, then resume normal breathing. Breathe out completely and inhale once again (from the same capsule) to ensure full delivery of the powder. Do not press the green piercing button again. Upon completion of the second inhalation, open the mouthpiece and tip the device to dispose of the used capsule; close the mouthpiece and dust cap of the inhaler device.
Do not take extra doses despite not being able to hear or feel the capsule vibrate. Tap the inhaler device on a table, holding the gray base in an upright position. Then check to see that the mouthpiece is properly seated in the gray base and attempt to inhale through the device again. If vibration still cannot be felt or heard, throw away the capsule, lift the green piercing button to open the base of the device, and check the center chamber for pieces of the capsule. Turn the device upside down and gently but firmly tap to remove any capsule pieces, then call clinician for instructions. (See Advice to Patients.)
If no improvement in COPD symptoms, make sure patient is inhaling the drug using the oral inhaler rather than swallowing the dry-powder capsules. (See Accidental Oral Ingestion under Cautions.)
Clean the Handihaler device as needed. Open the dust cap and mouthpiece, then open the base by lifting the green piercing button; look in the center chamber for any capsule pieces or powder buildup and tap out if present. Rinse device with warm water (do not use cleaning agents or detergents), pressing the green piercing button a few times so that the center chamber and piercing needle are under the running water; check that remaining powder or capsule pieces are removed. Dry the inhaler well by tipping excess water out on a paper towel; leave dust cap, mouthpiece, and gray base open by fully spreading it out to air dry for 24 hours. Do not use a hair dryer to dry the device. Do not use the inhaler when wet. If needed, clean the outside of the mouthpiece with a clean, damp cloth. 
Oral Inhalation Solution
Before first use of either Spiriva Respimat or Stiolto Respimat, place inhaler cartridge into inhaler.  Consult the manufacturer's prescribing information for detailed information on inhaler preparation.  Write discard date (3 months after cartridge is inserted into inhaler) on inhaler label. 
Prime inhaler before first use by turning clear base in direction of black arrows on label until click is heard (one-half turn) with inhaler upright and cap closed.  Flip cap until it fully snaps open, then point inhaler away from face, press dose release button, then close cap. 
Repeat these steps until spray is visible, then for 3 additional times.  Repeat initial actuation step of priming process (without 3 additional repetitions) after periods of nonuse (i.e., for >3 days).  If inhaler is not used for >21 days, repeat entire priming process. 
To administer a dose, hold inhaler upright with cap closed; turn clear base in direction of black arrows on label until click is heard (one-half turn).  Flip cap until it snaps fully open. 
Before inhaling dose, exhale slowly and completely.  Close lips around end of mouthpiece without covering air vents.  Pointing inhaler toward back of throat, press dose release button while taking a slow, deep inhalation through the mouth, continuing to inhale for as long as possible.  Hold the breath for 10 seconds (or as long as comfortable).  Repeat procedure once more to administer a full dose (2 inhalations), then close cap. 
Using only a damp tissue or cloth, clean mouthpiece of the inhaler, including metal part inside, at least once weekly.  Outside of inhaler can be wiped with a damp cloth.  Inhaler function not affected by minor mouthpiece discoloration. 
Dosage
Available as tiotropium bromide monohydrate; dosage expressed in terms of anhydrous tiotropium. 
Each capsule of the Spiriva Handihaler contains 18 mcg of tiotropium as an inhalation powder. However, the precise amount of drug delivered to the lungs depends on factors such as the patient’s inspiratory flow.
Each actuation of the Spiriva Respimat inhaler delivers 1.56 or 3.1 mcg of tiotropium bromide monohydrate (equivalent to 1.25 or 2.5 mcg of tiotropium, respectively) per metered spray.
Each actuation of the Stiolto Respimat inhaler delivers 3.1 mcg of tiotropium bromide monohydrate (equivalent to 2.5 mcg of tiotropium) and 2.7 mcg of olodaterol hydrochloride (equivalent to 2.5 mcg of olodaterol) per metered spray.
Precise amount of drug delivered to lungs depends on factors (e.g., patient's coordination between actuation of the inhaler and inspiration through the delivery system).  Respimat inhaler mechanically releases dose; delivered dose not dependent on patient's inspiratory effort. 
Commercially available inhaler delivers 60 metered sprays equivalent to 30 doses (2 actuations per dose) of the drug.

",,,"Contraindications


Known hypersensitivity to tiotropium bromide, ipratropium, or any ingredient in the formulation.  


Warnings/Precautions
Sensitivity Reactions
Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, such as angioedema (e.g., swelling of lips, tongue, throat), urticaria, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, itching, reported.   If such reactions occur, discontinue immediately and consider alternative therapy.   Closely monitor patients with history of hypersensitivity reactions to atropine for such reactions.   Use tiotropium oral inhalation powder (Spiriva HandiHaler) with caution in patients with severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins.
Use of Fixed Combinations
When used in fixed combination with olodaterol, consider the cautions, precautions, contraindications, and interactions associated with olodaterol.
Acute Bronchospasm
Delayed onset of action; not indicated for initial treatment. Do not use for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm (i.e., as rescue therapy).  
Possible Increased Risk of Stroke, Mortality, and/or Cardiovascular Events
Data are conflicting; possible increased risk of stroke identified from ongoing safety monitoring and pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials. Data on approximately 13,500 patients with COPD suggest an absolute excess risk of 2 strokes per 1000 patient-years with exposure to tiotropium compared with that of placebo. Other observational data involving over 32,000 patients and pooled analyses of almost 15,000 patients suggest an increased risk of mortality and/or cardiovascular events with use of inhaled anticholinergic agents, including tiotropium bromide. 
Increased risk of stroke, MI, or death with tiotropium not revealed in a placebo-controlled trial (Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium [UPLIFT]) in patients with COPD.   FDA concluded that available data do not support an association between use of tiotropium inhalation powder and an increased risk of stroke, MI, or cardiovascular death.
All-cause mortality similar in patients with previous cardiac disease receiving tiotropium oral inhalation powder and those receiving tiotropium oral inhalation solution in a long-term, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial (Tiotropium Safety and Performance in Respimat [TIOSPIR]).  
Increases in corrected QT (QTc) interval reported in patients receiving tiotropium oral inhalation powder.
Paradoxical Bronchospasm
Possible acute paradoxical bronchospasm.   Treat immediately with a short-acting inhaled β2-adrenergic agonist; discontinue tiotropium and consider alternative therapy. 
Ocular Effects
May worsen angle-closure glaucoma; use with caution in patients with this condition.   If signs or symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma (e.g., ocular pain/discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos, colored images in association with conjunctival congestion and corneal edema) occur, consult clinician immediately.  (See Advice to Patients.) Miotic eye drops alone not considered effective treatment for this condition.
Possible temporary blurred vision or pupillary dilation following inadvertent contact of tiotropium with the eyes.  (See Advice to Patients.)
GU Effects
Possible urinary retention, urinary difficulty, or urinary tract infection.  
May worsen symptoms and signs of urinary retention, especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.    If such signs and/or symptoms occur, immediately consult clinician.   Use with caution in patients with urinary retention.  
Accidental Oral Ingestion
Acute intoxication unlikely following inadvertent oral ingestion of the dry-powder capsules for oral inhalation since the drug is not well absorbed systemically. Adverse effect reports uncommon following ingestion of dry-powder capsules.
Specific Populations
Pregnancy
Category C. 
Limited data on tiotropium use during pregnancy inadequate to inform of drug-associated risk.
Poorly or moderately controlled asthma during pregnancy may increase maternal risk of preeclampsia and infant's risk for prematurity, low birth weight, and small size for gestational age. Closely monitor level of asthma control in pregnant women and adjust therapy as needed to maintain optimal control.
No evidence of structural abnormalities in animal studies. Tiotropium administration resulted in fetal resorption, fetal loss, decreased pup weight and survival in rats receiving higher than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dosage. In pregnant rabbits, tiotropium administration resulted in increased postimplantation fetal loss at dosages higher than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dosage.
Lactation
Distributed into milk in rodents; not known whether tiotropium is distributed into human milk.   Effects of the drug on breast-fed infants or milk production also not known. Consider benefits of breast-feeding and woman's clinical need for tiotropium along with any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from the drug or from the underlying maternal condition. Use caution.

vitamin-d,"Vitamin D has to be one of science’s most misunderstood vitamins.
For a start, it is not actually a vitamin, but a prohormone, which means that it is converted into a hormone by our body. It is also not just one substance, but five different substances, of which two have been identified as being the most important to humans. These are:

Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)
Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).

In addition, research has discovered that vitamin D is not only vital for calcium absorption and bone growth and remodeling, but several other important processes as well, such as modulating cell growth and immune system function.
Vitamin D acts on our bones, intestines, kidneys and parathyroid glands to keep calcium in balance throughout our body. Vitamin D receptors are also located within our cardiovascular system, lungs, pancreas, skeletal muscle, skin, and reproductive organs. In summary, vitamin D is a prohormone that is essential for good health.
Only 10% of the vitamin D our body needs is obtained from food. The rest is made by our bodies when our skin is exposed to sunlight.

Obesity (overweight)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse.


Kidney disease, severe or
Liver disease (including hepatitis)—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body.


Low amounts of folic acid or vitamin B12 in the blood—Zidovudine may worsen anemia caused by a decrease of folic acid or vitamin B12.

","Take zidovudine exactly as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. Also, do not stop taking zidovudine without checking with your doctor first. When your supply of zidovudine is running low, contact your doctor or pharmacist ahead of time. Do not allow yourself to run out of zidovudine.
Zidovudine comes with a patient information sheet. Read and follow the instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions.
Keep using zidovudine for the full time of treatment, even if you begin to feel better. It is also important to take zidovudine together with other medicines for HIV. Be sure to take all of the medicines your doctor ordered, and to take them at the right times. Only take medicine that your doctor has prescribed specifically for you. Do not share your medicine with other people.
For patients using zidovudine oral solution or syrup:

Shake it before use. Use a specially marked measuring spoon or other device to measure each dose accurately. The average household teaspoon may not hold the right amount of liquid.

Zidovudine works best when there is a constant amount in the blood. To help keep the amount constant, do not miss any doses. If you need help in planning the best times to take your medicine, talk with your doctor.
Dosing
The dose of zidovudine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of zidovudine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so.
The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine.

For HIV infection:

For oral dosage forms (capsules, solution, syrup, and tablets):

Adults—300 milligrams (mg) 2 times a day in combination with other anti-HIV medicines.
Children and infants 4 weeks of age and older—Dose is based on body weight or body size and must be determined by your child's doctor.

Weighs 30 kilograms (kg) or more—600 milligrams (mg) per day or 480 milligrams per square meter of body surface area (mg/m²) a day in divided doses.
Weighs 9 kg to less than 30 kg—18 mg per kg per day in divided doses.
Weighs 4 kg to less than 9 kg—24 mg per kg per day in divided doses.

.




To help prevent pregnant women from passing HIV to their babies during pregnancy and at birth:

For oral dosage form (capsules, syrup):

Pregnant women (after 14 weeks of pregnancy, up to the start of labor)—100 milligrams (mg) 5 times a day until the start of labor.
Newborn infants—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 2 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight every 6 hours starting 12 hours after birth and continuing through 6 weeks of age.


For oral dosage form (solution):

Pregnant women (after 14 weeks of pregnancy, up to the start of labor)—100 milligrams (mg) 5 times a day, 200 mg every 8 hours, or 300 mg every 12 hours until the start of labor.
Newborn infants—Dose is based on body weight and must be determined by your doctor. The usual dose is 2 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) (0.9 mg per pound) of body weight every 6 hours starting within 8 to 12 hours of birth and continuing through 6 weeks of age.





Missed dose
If you miss a dose of zidovudine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses.
Storage
Keep out of the reach of children.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed.
Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use.
Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing.
Do not freeze the oral liquid.
","It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure that zidovudine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects.
Zidovudine may cause blood problems. These problems may result in a greater chance of certain infections and slow healing. Therefore, you should be careful when using regular toothbrushes, dental floss, and toothpicks not to damage your or your child's gums. Check with your or your child's medical doctor or dentist if you have any questions about proper oral hygiene (mouth care) during treatment with zidovudine.
Check with your doctor if you or your child has muscle pain, tenderness, wasting, or unusual tiredness or weakness while you are using zidovudine.
Zidovudine may cause blood and bone marrow problems. Symptoms of bone marrow problems include fever, chills, sore throat pale skin, or unusual tiredness or weakness. These problems may require blood transfusions or temporarily stopping treatment with zidovudine. Check with your or your child's doctor if any new health problems or symptoms occur while you or your child are taking zidovudine.
Two rare but serious reactions to zidovudine are lactic acidosis (too much acid in the blood) and liver toxicity, which includes an enlarged liver. These are more common if you are female, very overweight (obese), or have been taking anti-HIV medicines for a long time. Call your doctor right away if you or your child have more than one of these symptoms: abdominal discomfort or cramping, dark urine, decreased appetite, diarrhea, general feeling of discomfort, light-colored stools, muscle cramping or pain, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness, trouble breathing, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin.
Your immune system may get stronger when you start taking HIV medicines. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child notices any changes in your health. Sometimes the immune system will start to fight infections that were hidden in your body, such as pneumonia or tuberculosis. Autoimmune disorders (eg, Graves' disease, polymyositis, or Guillain-Barré syndrome) may also occur.
Zidovudine may decrease or lose body fat, especially in your face, arms, legs, or buttocks, when zidovudine is used for a long time. Talk to your doctor if you have concerns.
Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements.
