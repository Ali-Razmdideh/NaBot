breztri-aerosphere,False,"
ICS medicines such as budesonide help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to breathing problems.
Anticholinergic medicines, such as glycopyrrolate and LABA medicines, such as formoterol fumarate help the muscles around the airways in your lungs stay relaxed to prevent symptoms, such as wheezing, cough, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These symptoms can happen when the muscles around the airways tighten. This makes it hard to breathe.
Breztri Aerosphere is a prescription medicine used long term to treat people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both.
Breztri Aerosphere is used as 2 inhalations, 2 times each day (2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs in the evening) to improve symptoms of COPD for better breathing and to reduce the number of flare-ups (the worsening of your COPD symptoms for several days).
Breztri Aerosphere is not for the treatment of asthma. It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in people with asthma. Breztri Aerosphere contains formoterol fumarate. LABA medicines such as formoterol fumarate when used alone increase the risk of hospitalizations and death from asthma problems. Breztri Aerosphere contains an ICS, an anticholinergic, and a LABA. When an ICS and LABA are used together, there is not a significant risk in hospitalizations and deaths from asthma problems.
Breztri Aerosphere is not to be used to relieve sudden breathing problems and will not replace a rescue inhaler. Always have a rescue inhaler (an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator) with you to treat sudden breathing problems. If you do not have a rescue inhaler, contact your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you.
Breztri Aerosphere should not be used in children. It is not known if this medicine is safe and effective in children.
",Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider and pharmacist each time you get a new medicine.,"
Before using Breztri Aerosphere, make sure your healthcare provider has taught you how to use the inhaler and you understand how to use it correctly.
Use this medicine exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to use it. Do not use more often than prescribed.
Use 2 inhalations of Breztri Aerosphere, 2 times each day (2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs in the evening).
Do not take more than 2 inhalations of Breztri Aerosphere 2 times each day.
If a dose (2 puffs) is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken at the usual time. Do not take more than one dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out after each dose (2 puffs). Do not swallow the water. This will help to reduce the chance of getting a fungus infection (thrush) in the mouth and throat.
If you take too much Breztri Aerosphere, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any unusual symptoms, such as worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, increased heart rate, or shakiness.
Do not spray Breztri Aerosphere in your eyes. If Breztri Aerosphere gets in your eyes, rinse them well with water. If redness continues, call your healthcare provider.
Do not use other medicines that contain a LABA or an anticholinergic for any reason. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if any of your other medicines are LABA or anticholinergic containing medicines.
Do not change or stop any medicines used to control or treat your breathing problems. Your healthcare provider will change your medicines as needed.
Breztri Aerosphere does not relieve sudden breathing problems and you should not take extra doses to relieve sudden symptoms. Always have a rescue inhaler with you to treat sudden symptoms. If you do not have a rescue inhaler, call your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you.
Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical care right away if:

your breathing problems get worse.
you need to use your rescue inhaler more often than usual.
your rescue inhaler does not work as well to relieve your symptoms.

fentanyl,False,See also: Fentanyl Abuse,"Fatal side effects can occur if you use this medicine with alcohol, or with other drugs that cause drowsiness or slow your breathing.","Due to the risk of respiratory depression, the transdermal patch is for use in opioid-tolerant patients only; opioid tolerant patients have been taking at least: morphine 60 mg daily, oral oxycodone 30 mg daily, oral hydromorphone 8 mg daily, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid for 1 week or longer.
-Discontinue all other extended-release opioids when beginning therapy.

Initial doses: The initial dose should be individualized taking into account the patient's prior treatment experience. This dose may be calculated based on the dose conversion guidelines in the product package insert, local protocol, or another reliable reference; when calculating, be aware there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products and therefore it is preferable to underestimate a 24-hour fentanyl requirement and provide rescue medication than to overestimate which could result in adverse reactions.
Dose titration:
-Initial: May increase dose after 3 days based on the daily dose of supplemental opioid analgesics required by the patient on the second or third day of the initial application.
-Further titration should occur after no less than two 3-day applications as it may take up to 6 days for fentanyl levels to reach equilibrium. Titration should be based on the daily dose of supplementary opioids required and the following ratio may be used: Increase transdermal fentanyl by 12 mcg//hr for use of supplemental oral morphine doses of 45 mg/24 hours.
Maintenance dose: Adjust dose to obtain an appropriate balance between pain management and opioid-related adverse reactions. During chronic therapy, periodically reassess the continued need for opioid analgesics.

Comments:
-Do not begin a patient on a fentanyl transdermal patch as their first opioid.

Initial dose: Extended-release tablets: 5 mg orally every 12 hours

CONVERSION DOSES:
Immediate-Release Oxymorphone to Extended-Release Oxymorphone Tablets: Administer same total daily dose
-Initial dose: One-half total daily immediate-release requirement as extended-release tablet orally every 12 hours

From Other Oral Opioids to Oxymorphone Extended-Release Tablets:
-Discontinue all other around-the-clock opioid drugs when oxymorphone extended-release therapy is initiated.
-Published potency tables can be used to estimate a patient's 24-hour oral oxymorphone requirement; however, due to substantial inter-patient variability, the conversion should then underestimate a patient's 24-hour requirement and provide rescue medication as the dose is titrated.
-Alternatively, the following conversion factors (CF) may be used to convert selected oral opioids to the extended-release oxymorphone tablet: Oxymorphone, CF=1; Hydrocodone, CF=0.5; Oxycodone, CF=0.5; Methadone, CF= 0.5, Morphine, CF=0.333
-As an example: Sum the total daily dose of prior oral opioid; multiply that sum by the CF to obtain 24-hour oral oxymorphone requirement; divide by 2 to calculate approximate starting dose to be given every 12 hours, round down, if necessary.
-These CFs cannot be used to convert from oxymorphone extended-release tablets to the selected oral opioid as doing so will result in overestimation of the oral opioid dose and may result in fatal respiratory depression

TITRATION AND MAINTENANCE:
Maintenance Dose: Individually titrate to a dose that provides adequate analgesia and minimizes adverse reactions; dose adjustments may be made in 5 to 10 mg increments every 12 hours, every 3 to 7 days.
Breakthrough Pain: If the level of pain increases after dose stabilization, attempt to identify the source before increasing dose; rescue medication with appropriate immediate-release analgesia may be helpful

Comments:
-An opioid tolerant patient is one who has been receiving for 1-week or longer at least: oral morphine 60 mg/day, fentanyl transdermal patch 25 mcg per hour, oral oxycodone 30 mg/day, oral hydromorphone 8 mg/day, oral oxymorphone 25 mg/day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid
-When converting from methadone, close monitoring is of particular importance due to methadone's long half-life.
-Dose conversion should be done carefully and with close monitoring due to large patient variability in regards to opioid analgesic response.
-Upon cessation of therapy in the physically dependent patient, individually taper reassessing frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms.","Avoid driving or hazardous activity until you know how this medicine will affect you.
